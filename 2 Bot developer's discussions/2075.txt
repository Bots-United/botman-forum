I have noticed that pfnClientCommand in engine.cpp does not call its engine counterpart; the code for pfnClientCommand is like this:

void pfnClientCommand(edict_t* pEdict, char* szFmt, ...)
{
   if (debug_engine) { fp=fopen("bot.txt","a"); fprintf(fp,"pfnClientCommand=%s\n",szFmt); fclose(fp); }
   return;
}

Why is the engine counterpart of ClientCommand not called, and would it be safe to do so?  I ask this because sounds do not get played on radio commands (I am working with Open-Source JailBreak).  I get this in the bot.txt file:

ClientCommand: radio1
pfnServerPrint: (TEAM)ProgramMan (radio): We need guards at the jail!

pfnClientCommand=play %s /* <--this is the line */

pfnMessageBegin: edict=1df2550 dest=1 type=74
pfnWriteByte: 1
pfnWriteString: (TEAM)ProgramMan (radio): We need guards at the jail!

Obviously, the play command never gets called because pfnClientCommand "return"s before it can.

I fixed my problem by adding a check for 'play':
code:

if ((strncmp(szFmt,"play",4) == 0) && !(pEdict->v.flags & FL_FAKECLIENT))
   (*g_engfuncs.pfnClientCommand)(pEdict, szFmt);
else
   return;



(Edit) Added check for bots (/Edit)
