Heres how to compile your SDK 1.0 mod to work for the FIRST demo release of half-life :-

if you look in eiface.h, there is some variables: 

#ifdef HLDEMO_BUILD 
#define INTERFACE_VERSION       001 
#else  // !HLDEMO_BUILD, i.e., regular version of HL 
#define INTERFACE_VERSION            138 
#endif // !HLDEMO_BUILD 

Replace all of that with : 
#define INTERFACE_VERSION       001 


Your mod should run with the demo version, but you will be limited to singleplayer only and possibly no fake clients(depends on version)

To compile your SDK2.0 to work with a demo which has a version over 1.0.1.6 :-

I think that the oposing force demo is over version 1.0.1.6
Doing the same changes as the 1.0 sdk should definatly work though.

I hope this has helped you in some unknown way.

Anyone else here recall this being illegal. Im sure it says in some documentation somewhere (either with the HL: Game, demo or SDK) that you can only make modifications that will work with the full and registered version of half-life alone.

Mods are technically possible but are illegal due to clauses in the readme. It was the same with every quake demo and test version. Sorry man.

Hacks are illegal, but you don't see anyone npt doing them, do you?

I only posted this to show how it could be done.

"A. Subject to the grant of license hereinabove, you may not, in whole or in part, copy, photocopy, reproduce, translate, reverse engineer, derive source code from, modify, disassemble, decompile, or create derivative works based on the Program, or remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Program."

Well, this bit is in the license in the full version, but mod making isn't illegal!

"5. Termination. This License Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate the License Agreement at any time by destroying the Program. Sierra may, at its discretion, terminate this License Agreement in the event that you fail to comply with the terms and conditions contained herein. In such event, you must immediately destroy the Program."

This is interesting. This means i can go to the valve HQ and wipe their computers of anything related to half-life. (it says to destroy the program)

When i clicked on the "I agree" button, i didn't actually do it.
I clicked on my mouse, but the computer clicked on it.
(common sense)

I think u r!!! :)

And yes it is UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU who makes the computer click. The computer doesn't do anything unless its been programmed to do it, and it wouldn't click on the button if u had not given the input on the mouse.

U might as well say that if u win on a computer game, it's not u who won, it's the computer!!!!!!!!! The computer just does what u tell it to. Unless it's running Windoze. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHA

God. You must be some sort of retard!
F*cking hell!!! When it says "You may terminate the License Agreement at any time by destroying the Program." It doesnt f*cking mean you can go to valve and wipe their computers of anything to do with half-life!!!!! It means you can stop the licence by destroying you copy of the game, the single CD!!!!!!

What i really meant is that the sdk doesn't say anything about NOT compiling for the demo.
