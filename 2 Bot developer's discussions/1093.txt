I think u can do that via "RoundTime", u get this message @ every start of a round, I think. But with my bot, it's not workin' 100% :-( ...

I just set pBot->f_pause_time = gpGlobals + 5.0 until I have found out how to detect round time... it works quite well, I don't think anyone will have a freeze time higher than 5 :)

code:
pBot->f_pause_time  = gpGlobals->time + CVAR_GET_FLOAT("mp_freezetime");


then u don't have to define a fixed freezetime ...

Where do you put that in?

somewhere, where u detect the start of a round ... but at least in the spawn routine ...

yeah, the code is quite easy. Maybe its even handy to set a bool for a bot or a global bool in order to know if a bot is 'frozen' or not. This way you can do multiple checks without having to check for the cvar everytime.

I think this idea is ok, but ur code gets a bit shitty when u add a variable for every little shit. U have f_pause_time, so why don't use it ?

well, its not nescesary. But it IS handy to have a bool. Maybe you think its shitty when coding, but its more readable when having a check:

if (pBot->freeze)
{
// Bots is still frozen by freezetime (or by a freeze command}
}

then do constantly:
if (pBot->f_pause_time < gpGlobals->time)

actually, the hpb bot code i used didnt had a pause time i guess. Since it didnt had any freezetime support. 

I use a bool to do multiple checks, e.g. so it doesnt think its stuck etc. 

Anwayz, its just the way you like to code it. :)

Wish I knew about that CVAR stuff... makes things pretty simple!! Didn't know it was that easy, and it will also work if u change the round time in game... maybe I could also check for round time, and make the bots move more carefully if round time is high (>5mins)... I think all the bots at the moment run about too much, they should have some way of knowing to creep round corners, and move back if necessary (getting shot at)...
