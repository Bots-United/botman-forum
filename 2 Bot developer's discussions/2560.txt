Okay this is not an entirely new problem, but may be a solution to my old one. Does anyone happen to have the dod weapon ID numbers for the bot_weapon.h, or know how i can find them???

for weapon ID numbers, enable debug_engine and look in the bot.txt file that will be created when you start a game. Weapon ID numbers are sent to clients when they join with the WeaponList message, and we can catch them on the fly.

In reply to your 2nd post.

I don't know if it's what you are talking about, but for DMC (as an example), where weapon IDs are not sequential but bit-shifted (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,64 and 128), I noticed that the MSB part of the integer where the weapon bitmask is stored changes sometimes, so I mask it with 0xFF00 when I want to check the bitmap.

Hope this helps.

Here's the weapon IDs I used for DMC...
code:
// weapon ID values for Valve's DMC
#define DMC_WEAPON_AXE            1
#define DMC_WEAPON_SHOTGUN        2
#define DMC_WEAPON_DOUBLESHOTGUN  4
#define DMC_WEAPON_NAILGUN        8
#define DMC_WEAPON_SUPERNAIL     16
#define DMC_WEAPON_GRENADE1      32
#define DMC_WEAPON_ROCKET1       64
#define DMC_WEAPON_LIGHTNING    128

i think xdeviantx was talking about the Day of Defeat mod, not DMC.

k, im not sure i made the problem clear...

the weaponlist network packet for valve handgun looks like this

pfnMessageBegin: edict=1e01e40 dest=1 type=76
pfnWriteString: weapon_9mmhandgun   // state = 0
pfnWriteByte: 2                     // state = 1
pfnWriteByte: 250                   // state = 2
pfnWriteByte: -1                    // state = 3
pfnWriteByte: -1                    // state = 4
pfnWriteByte: 1                     // state = 5
pfnWriteByte: 0                     // state = 6
pfnWriteByte: 2                     // state = 7
pfnWriteByte: 0                     // state = 8
pfnMessageEnd:

whereas the weaponlist network packet for dod luger looks like this

pfnMessageBegin: edict=1de6594 dest=1 type=76
pfnWriteString: weapon_luger      // state = 0
pfnWriteByte: 4                  // state = 1
pfnWriteByte: 24            // state = 2
pfnWriteByte: -1            // state = 3
pfnWriteByte: -1            // state = 4
pfnWriteByte: 1                  // state = 5
pfnWriteByte: 1                  // state = 6
pfnWriteByte: 4                  // state = 7
pfnWriteByte: 64            // state = 8
pfnWriteByte: 8                  // state = *-> 9 <-* ??
pfnMessageEnd:

look! there are 8 lines in the valve one but ->9<- in the DoD one...do i need to declare this extra line in the typedef struc bot_weapon_t in bot_weapons.h??

You have to figure out which information is passed by this new state, then decide if it has to be put in the structure for later use, or not.
You have also to add a new state to your BotClient_Dod_WeaponList() function that will grab this data for you from the network packet. Current BotClient_*_WeaponList() has 8 states, just add another one.
This extra state might not be of great use for the game, but you never know. Currently I see no way to figure out what's related with this one. Log it to a file when playing and see if it matches some in-game weapon behaviour.
