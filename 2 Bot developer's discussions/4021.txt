I sent cheesy an email about this but as I haven't gotten a response back I figured I would post it here.

I have modified the HPB Bot template source to support Natural Selection, but I don't know how to make the bots join the teams (besides giving them waypoints in the ready room to walk into).  I have turned on the debug engine and looked at the log file, but I don't see anything like a client command telling what team to join.

Now I know cheesy has solved this problem with his NS bot, so tell me plzzz. :P

Oh, and please don't post code, I will make that on my own.

Search for an info_join_team (the team it will join is held in in pent->v.team, 1 being marine, 2 being alien) or an info_join_autoassign

By using FindEntityByClassname you can find these entities. When you find the entity you want, call DispatchTouch() function with pentTouched being the info_join_team/info_join_autoassign edict, and pentOther being the bots pEdict.

Thank you very much, I added it in and it actually worked on my first build, amazingly enough.
