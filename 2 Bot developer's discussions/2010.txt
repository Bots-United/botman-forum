Can somebody show how to make infinite life on the HPB template drawbeam function? (from waypoint.cpp)

You can't.  Beams have a limited lifespan.  You can change the time to a larger value, but at some point it will disappear and you will have to redraw it.  That's the purpose of the WaypointThink() function.

Well I could set it to high value. However, I can't make it work.

<snip from drawbeam>

   WRITE_COORD(start.x);
   WRITE_COORD(start.y);
   WRITE_COORD(start.z);
   WRITE_COORD(end.x);
   WRITE_COORD(end.y);
   WRITE_COORD(end.z);
   WRITE_SHORT( m_spriteTexture );
   WRITE_BYTE( 1 ); // framestart
   WRITE_BYTE( 10 ); // framerate
   WRITE_BYTE( 10 ); // life in 0.1's
   WRITE_BYTE( width ); // width
   WRITE_BYTE( noise );  // noise

   WRITE_BYTE( red );   // r, g, b
   WRITE_BYTE( green );   // r, g, b
   WRITE_BYTE( blue );   // r, g, b

</snip>

When I change this value "   WRITE_BYTE( 10 ); // life in 0.1's " to something higher like 50, it was supposed to stay alive for 5 sec. but it still disappears after 1 sec.

What am I doing wrong here?

Hmmmm... somehow I was calling a wrong (unchanged) version of the function - I tried changing its name and then it worked.

But I can't make it stay for a minute.

It's a byte.  The biggest value you can send is 255.  Since this is in 1/10ths of a second that would be 25.5 seconds.  25.5 seconds is the maximum time you can display the beam without redrawing it.
