Hello everyone,

I've just stared programming a new bot for CS. As probably many of you, I got stucked with lots of technical and many more theoretical problems.

My main questions is if creating a new(esh) bot for CS worth the effort?!

of course I decided that I will write a BOT never created before, but reading this forum I realized, that there are other guys out there with the very same idea in mind. I hope I can come up with new and maybe better ones, but this thing just looks so big.

The main idea I would like to focus on is Team tactics, and a so powerfull AI that lets the bot kill an enemy with a knife, attacking from the back, or even making fun about following a human player thru a map, making already dead players go crazy when they are looking at the action from death cam.

Ge.

if you're hoping to "hit the bigtime" with your bot you might be dissapointed, seeing how many bots and bot programmers there are already, but hey, its fun and you learn a lot about coding and some stuff, so in my opinion its worth it.  and hey, if you're looking at a team bot, did you check out the CGF bot at botepidemic, some cool team stuff there.  have fun

Is it worth it. I think that nomatter how bad your bot is, as long as it can shoot and run, then its a good bot and you should be proud of yourself for trying, so YES it is worth the effort

The most important thing is to have fun doing it (and maybe learn a little bit along the way).  Don't get started if you can't devote at least 6 months into the effort.  It will take at least that long to get a good understand of how Half-Life works, how to intercept and interpret client messages sent from the MOD, how to deal with things like doors, ladders, and water in the levels, how to create decent navigation code, how to create good weapon usage and combat tactics and how to add special features to the bots to make them seem more human-like.

If you just want to play around with things for your own personal use, then you don't need to worry about any of the above, but if it's something you plan on releasing to the general public, there are already many developers ahead of you and no one will want to play your bot if it can't compete with anything that's already out there.

You might also consider doing a bot for another MOD.  Action Half-Life, Science and Industry, Gunman, or other MODs would be good candidates for a new bot and no one that I'm aware of is working on bots for these MODs.
