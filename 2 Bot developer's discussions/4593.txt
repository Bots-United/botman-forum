Ok, I hope you get my good explenation :P. Well we all know that tracelines don't get blocked for some reason by skyboxes. I know that you can see if the trace ended in a skybox. But i want to compare different trace-distances, I want to select the trace which was stopped at the highest distance. For now i have this function todo this:

code:

float UTIL_GetVecDist(bot_t *pBot, Vector vec)
{
    edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;
    Vector v_src = pEdict->v.origin;
    Vector vecEnd;
    float dist = (vec - v_src).Length();
    float distance;
    int i;

    if (UTIL_PointContents(vec) != CONTENT_SKY)
      return dist;

    UTIL_MakeVectors(pEdict->v.v_angle);

    distance = dist;

    for (i=1;i<=dist;i+=50)
    {
       vecEnd = v_src + gpGlobals->v_forward * i;
       if (UTIL_PointContents(vecEnd) ==  
           CONTENT_SKY)
       {
         distance = (vecEnd - v_src).Length();
         break;
       }
   }
   return distance;
}



anyway as far as i know it works but as you can see its far from efficent :(

Does anyone a better way ??
