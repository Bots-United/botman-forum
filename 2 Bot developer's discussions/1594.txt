Ok, 

I have tried some waypoints adding have invoked the "waypoint menu". But it seems that when I pressed "1" or any numbers 1 to 5, it just didnt go to the sub menu or do what is intended.
why?

But when I bind "menuselect x" to "some key", it works...

ANyone can explain?

Hi again...

firearms uses 'vguimenuselect' so you must use 'vguimenuoption', too, i think... that should work (im using it in my menu, too).

Some MODs remove the old style text menu support (what returns the "menuselect 1" response) if they don't use it.  Holy Wars also does this.  There's nothing you can do about it short of binding keys to "menuselect 1", "menuselect 2", etc. and don't forget to send a blank menu (with a " " string as the menu text) to clear the menu from the HUD when you are done.

Thanks..it works now

But when I pressed number 6, 7, 8, 9 it doesnt work. Binding them to vguimenuoption works!.

Funny.
