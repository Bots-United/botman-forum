I'm led to believe admin_mod has this already, ask on the admin_mod forums.

You can easily spawn entities within the HPB_Bot sourcecode.

I tried it on svencoop, and managed to spawn a scientist...
Only problem was that you could walk through him... :\

I'd believe the scientists "movetype" would need to be "solid" so that collisions with the scientist will work. Possibly you didn't set it and it's movetype was some erronous type (such as no-clip)
