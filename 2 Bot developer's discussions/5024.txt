If you want to make a bidirectional interface between the game DLL and the engine, with the minimal code, you need all the functions in engine.cpp, most of dll.cpp, linkfunc.cpp and that other file where GiveFnptrsToDll() is in, can't remember which one.

The metamod source code (at www.metamod.org) will give you a better idea of what code is needed to hook between the engine and the game DLL code.
