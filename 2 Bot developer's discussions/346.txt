Ok I somehow did something and downloaded the
standardsdk 2.0. Now does anyone know where I can
get a tutorial on making bots?

There isn't really one.  You can look on the HLPP site.  There's the beginnings of bot tutorials there.  Check my MOD FAQ page for the link to Half-Life Programming Planet.

Also look at some of the bot sites on my "Links" page.
