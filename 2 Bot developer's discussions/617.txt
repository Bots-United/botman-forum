Well, I've never played HLPB or anything, but maybe you've not added in all the PB entities to your Bot Code, so when the flag entity is sent to your code the game has no idea what it is and crashes?

If you don't have "-dev" on your hl.exe command line, you should add that.  Right-click on your Half-Life shortcut (create one if you don't have one) and select "Properties".  Add "-dev" (without the quotes) to the end of the target line and click on "OK"

If you see any messages about something "not found" then you don't have all the entites added yet.

You may also have to turn on the engine debugging stuff.  Use "debug_engine" (without quotes) to enable logging to a file in the Half-Life directory called "bot.txt".  It will show engine and MOD functions that are being called.  The pfnMessageBegin() stuff will be used when the menu  used to join a game is displayed on a HUD.  You will probably have to modify the TFC or CS menu code in engine.cpp and bot_client.cpp to get the bots to join a game in Half-Life Paint Ball.

yea i have the -dev command already on there.  and i havent seen any "not found" messages yet, so i think im good there.  i also use debug_engine and i look at the file sometimes.  maybe its something i have to do in engine.cpp like u said.  thanks

I know this is a stupid question, but do you have HL 1101 or later? When I first tried to add bots without the latest HL patch, they would connect, but they wouldn't appear in the game...

I always run my hl/cs/etc with -dev in the commandline, but it did not seem to show up :)

Or else i did not seem to notice it, one or the other...
