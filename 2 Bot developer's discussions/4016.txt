Sure :D

bayobot, tu peux me contacter par email (pm@racc-ai.com) si tu veux poser tes questions en français et je te filerai un coup de main dans la mesure du possible (parce qu'en anglais, c'est pas gagné à ce que je vois)

I may then translate your problem (and hopefully its answer) in english in this forum.

QUOTE:

I am developing a bot for WormsHL (wormshl.fr.st), of course based on HPB. The wormshl team and I are facing some problems that seem to be solvable only thanks to your help, indeed after several furious debug sessions with extensive tracing of the bots connecting process, I don't know anymore where nor now to head up to. Thanks in advance.
 
All the symptoms that are described below correspond (definitely) to one single problem. however the fact of answering to any of these points can only help.
 
1) The wormshl mod uses VGUI menus, in order for the bots to get into the game normally one uses the FakeClientCommand ("menuselect" ... . Which code has to be added to our mod in order to handle the "menuselect" ?  Or which version of the SDK has to be used where menuselect would already be implemented.
 
2) Could the fact that a bot would not close the VGUI, make the game crash.
3) Since I can't use the vgui stuff so far, I am using the KeyValueData in order to change team and model (a string that looks like "/modele/wormsblue/name/Sarool/team/blue" ). Apart from a misprogramming of mine, can it be problems. Or rather than that, can this work.

4) When I run wormshl without bots, all goes fine, as soon as I add a bot the whole stuff crashes but the bot still had the time to connect. What are the most common bugs that can arise.
(in order to give me an idea about where to look for).

5) When I run a dedicated server with bots, it works. On the contrary as soon as I try to connect a client to this server, the client crashes. Does someone have an idea about the cause of the problem.



Check your mail...

An additional note though: the "menuselect" client command does NOT tell the server explicitly "I have choosen this element in the menu". It's just a client command like all the others. The VGUI system itself can send back whatever client command instead of "menuselect" when you click a menu button. For example, in TFC, it is "team N", or "hwguy" if you choose the heavy weapons guy.

[tr: vérifie ton courrier.

Note: la commande "menuselect" n'est pas le moyen "officiel" de dire au serveur "j'ai sélectionné cet élément dans le menu". C'est une clientcommand comme n'importe quelle autre. Les menus VGUI peuvent renvoyer n'importe quelle commande client plutôt que "menuselect". Par exemple, dans TFC, c'est "team N", ou encore "hwguy" si tu choisis le mitrailleur ]
