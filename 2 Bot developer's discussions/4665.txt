It will no easier to get the bots to do something using HPB bot code than it would to do it using the Bot Number 10 code.

What is it that you are trying to get them to do?

Well i have a weapon thats not a weapon is a grappling hook classifyed as a weapon. but the reason i want to use hpb is so that i can make waypoints that have grapple at like the jump way point. my bot10 just go stright till they hit a wall and then take a right

When I added the grappling hook to the James Bond Nightfire bots (which is a slightly modified HPB bot), I added 2 new waypoints tags.  One for the location to stand when using the grapple, and one for the point where they need to aim the grapple.  The grapple aim point is actually a waypoint that is located physically at the grapple point itself (these had to be sey by going into "noclip" mode and flying up next to the point where you want them to grapple to and dropping at waypoint at that location).

The navigate toward the grapple stand point, then they set the grapple aim point as their "enemy".  They aim at the enemy and when they are dead-on target, they fire the grappple and hold the fire button down for several seconds (until they detect that they have stopped moving very much and then they let go of the button).

It worked pretty well.  Of course they are always standing at the same point when using grapple point X, but you can have several points to stand at for the same grapple point and have them randomly pick from those.
