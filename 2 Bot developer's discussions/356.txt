(Sorry, but I've just started writing bot code for HL/CS)
How can I detect the 'buy_zone' ??
The buy_zone isn't obviously an entity (or my bots don't find it al least!)
the rescue zone is an ent .(func_rescue_ ... or something similar)

One way is to intercept the messages that normally get sent to the client's HUD (the little shopping cart).  Everything that you see displayed on the HUD has a network client message associated with it.  You can find these by enabling the "debug_engine" flag (by typing debug_engine in the console).  Engine function calls will be logged to a file called "bot.txt" in the Half-Life directory.  Turn on engine debugging, do whatever you want to look for (like entering a buy zone).  Then exit the game and look through the bot.txt file for messages being sent to your client.
