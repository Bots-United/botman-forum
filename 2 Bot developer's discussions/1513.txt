Whats the best way to open up a txt file and put each line into a floating variable? The code I have crashes everytime.

file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
if (file)
{
  while(feof(file)!=1)
  {
   num2++;
   fscanf(file,"%8.2f\n",stuff1[num2]);
   fscanf(file,"%8.2f\n",stuff2[num2]);
   fscanf(file,"%8.2f\n",stuff3[num2]);
  }
fclose(file);
}

Any ideas?
Thanks

Hmm I don't think you should use the newline. I can't remember but doesn't scanf read a whole line at a time anyway? Try it without the '\n' at teh end of each string.

Try finding a command that reads a line at a time, otherwise write your own. Just read the floating point number into a string a character at a time, then convert the string to a float. Not very efficient, but scanf should do what you want anyway.

scanf and fscanf take a pointer to a variable.  Use this...

fscanf(file, "%8.2f\n", &stuff1[num2]);

...instead of this...

fscanf(file, "%8.2f\n", stuff1[num2]);

...assuming stuff1 is an array of floats.

DOH! I forgot that too. It's one of the strangest things when learning C, the pointers, although I do understand them it's easy to forget to use the & to specify the address...

Ok, i've revised the code now and it doesn't crash. But whatever fscanf reads in, it reads it to be 0.00 everytime. Heres the new code:

char string;
FILE *file;
file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");      
int i;
fscanf(file, "%d", &i);
for(num1=1;num1<=i;num1++)
{
  fscanf(file, "%8.2f", &stuff1[num1]);
  fscanf(file, "%8.2f", &stuff2[num1]); 
  fscanf(file, "%8.2f", &stuff3[num1]);
}
fclose(file);

So inside floating variables stuff1,2,3 they all are 0.00

Thanks Elite and Botman for all your help, but any new ideas why its reading 0.00
The files just look like this inside the text file.

-2222.34
3333.65
4523.67

Like that

Download this file to see something:
 members.nbci.com/blind_20/myfile.zipClick Here

This will be puzzling!

And how does that help? I can make files open in DOS too! 

I just don't see the point to your post Brian.

Did you download the file is does exactly what you wanted:

Displays
-2222.34
3333.65
4523.67

I used the exact same code as you did.

You might want to change this...

file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");

...to this...

if ((file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r")) == NULL)
{
   printf("Couldn't open file!  Aborting!\n");
   return;
}

...since you may be getting 0.0 if the file was never really opened.

Thanks Botman and Elite for you help. I got it figured out, seemed in my for next loop i had a small error or such.

But thanks again!

Cool so my newline thing was right too :p

Happy to be of service! :)

Also why have you got 8.2, should it not be 4.2 if there are only 4 points before the decimal place? I've not done any file access for a while so I can't remember...
