Hi, I have just started getting this error:
     HPB_bot - Can't get MOD's GetNewDLLFunctions!

Any idea as to why this would just start happening, or in fact what causes it?

make sure your project is either built with __cdecl calling convention or declare it yourself.

extern "C" void __cdecl GetNewDLLFunctions (etc)

When you say my project are you talking about the bot or the mod? It is declared in two locations in HPB_bot.dll.

That function isn't used in most MODs.  TFC uses it, but I'm not sure if any other MODs do.  By default that is commented out in the HPB bot template h_export.cpp file like so...
code:
   other_GetNewDLLFunctions = (GETNEWDLLFUNCTIONS)GetProcAddress(h_Library, "GetNewDLLFunctions");

//   if (other_GetNewDLLFunctions == NULL)
//   {
//      // Can't find GetNewDLLFunctions!
//
//            ALERT( at_error, "HPB_bot - Can't get MOD's GetNewDLLFunctions!" );
//   }

...You may have mistakenly removed the comments thinking that the MOD should include this function.

Well I'll just comment it out then :}

What is this for anyway?

"What is this for anyway?"

TFC uses it for the functions in the NEW_DLL_FUNCTIONS structure.  See the SDK 2.1 engine\eiface.h file for details.
