Yes I know that but you have to submit an address where fileplanet can download it from. And if you don't got an address??

How can you upload it directly to fileplanet???

You can go get a free web page from web hosts like geocities, tripod, anglefire, or others.  Here's a list of free web service providers...

Ok now I got another problem. I got a homepage by geocities and I got a download page, but when someone wants to download a file from my downloads page geocities ask for a username and a password. How can I change it so that everyone can download it???

just zip it up and add a link to the zip file if... or if its an exe just leave it as is and put a link to it. If that doesnt work yahoo is doing that becuase they prolly dont want people to put files on their server in which case you need a server that can do it. xoom.com homsite.com and many many more... :P
and to get rid of those yucky banner adds from xoom or yahoo just go to bannerkillaz.com i think thats it something simmilar :P
