Best putting your own stuff in a new file or at the end of botmans stuff.
That way its easier to use beyondcompare or similar to compare your code against new template releases by botman.

If you are talking about how to handle teams that are allies (like in HUNTED type maps), you can look at the keyvalue pairs assigned to the "info_tfdetect" entity in a map.

Download the FGD file used to create TFC maps (I think I found mine on www.planetfortress.com).  Look at the definition of the "info_tfdetect" entity.  It tells the TFC MOD which classes are valid in that map and which teams are allies.  There are keyvalue pairs called "team1_allies", "team2_allies", "team3_allies" and "team4_allies".

You can use the DispatchKeyValue() function to search for "info_tfdetect" then when this entity is being created, look for "team1_allies", "team2_allies", etc.  The FGD file will tell you what format the keyvalue data is stored in.
