I have searched the forums on this topic, but i havent found anything that answers my question.
im trying to port the HPB_bot template to the Existence mod, when i add a bot it says
SZ_GetSpace: tried to write to an uninitialized sizebuf_t: ???
and shuts down HL, i have tryed to run in debug mode to see what makes this happend. The last bit of the log is:

ClientCommand: addbot 2
ClientUserInfoChanged: pEntity=22f6664 infobuffer=\name\Bot\model\gordon\topcolor\1\bottomcolor\1
pfnMessageBegin: edict=22f6340 dest=1 type=75
pfnWriteByte: 1
pfnWriteString: Creating HPB bot...

pfnMessageEnd:
pfnPvAllocEntPrivateData:
ClientConnect: pent=22f6664 name=Bot
ClientPutInServer: 22f6664
pfnMessageBegin: edict=22f6664 dest=1 type=103
pfnWriteByte: 0
pfnMessageEnd:
pfnFindEntityInSphere:
pfnFindEntityInSphere:
pfnSetModel: edict=22f6664 models/player.mdl
pfnSetSize: 22f6664
pfnSetClientMaxspeed: edict=22f6664 speed=240.000000
pfnFindEntityInSphere:
pfnFindEntityInSphere:
pfnClientCommand: edict=22f6664 cmd=enterspectatemode


at this point it has not done more than join the game, it has not even recieved the MOTD.
the mod has some anticheat detection, im not sure if its this that cause it, it should try to detect cheats somewhere around this point.

when i join myself i get in like i should (naturally) but here is what is after the point the bot would stop:

pfnFindEntityInSphere:
pfnFindEntityInSphere:
pfnClientCommand: edict=22f6340 cmd=enterspectatemode

pfnSetSize: 23009b4
pfnSetOrigin:


if im not very mistaken this could be caused by the server trying to send info straight into the bot which is not a client and therefore return this bug.

can any1 help me with this, if not can u give me input on how i can figure out what i return and throw that at the server whenever it reaches this point.

This...

SZ_GetSpace: tried to write to an uninitialized sizebuf_t

...is caused by MODs sending network messages to clients using pfnClientCommand() or pfnClientPrintf().  Both of these will crash the engine if the client is a bot (a fake client).

You can prevent this problem by catching the pfnClientCommand() and pfnClientPrintf() functions (in engine.cpp) and preventing them from going on to the engine if the client is a bot.

Download the HPB bot 1.8a source code and look at the engine.cpp file where I intercept pfnClientCommand() and pfnClientPrintf() and check to make sure that the edict does not have the FL_FAKECLIENT bit set.  You will need to do the same thing in your code.

Existence worked for me without any major problems, maybe the 'addbot 2' is the problem here?
(just a wild guess)

i will try all over again then, but what version did you try with.. because 1.4 is rather new, and there has been added cheat detection to tthe mod

and botman, i am using the 1.8a code. but it still does this.. i guess its something build in the mod, it might the same problem as the one with admin mod.

well i will look harder into it, and pray that there is light at the end of the tunnel

My bot works with both EX1.3 and EX1.4.
My framework is Botman`s HPB template #3.

Perhaps there is something in HPB1.8a that causes the problem? try to disable bot chatting, maybe the bots try to chat before they are in the game?

i tried with template #3 and it worked, mostly
then i tried with 1.8a again and it worked, mostly

now i have this weird problem, i cant join the rebel team, i end up joined and playing with no hud, weapons, or anything and not listed as on a team in the scoreboard. and it says i tried to join rebels unsuccesfully
if i join agents i get the same error telling me it was unsuccesfull yet i get in and play as usual

so now im looking through those darn entities to see if any1 are missing.. damn it

No need to search for entities, it seems like an Existence bug... The VGUI is actualy there only you can`t see it.

Type vguiselect <number> in the console to choose your charachter (replace <number> with you char - dr. white is 2)
