Look in the ReadMe.txt file that comes with the HPB bot template source code.  It explains about running the exports.c application to get the list of exported entities then adding LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC() definitions for each of those.

NOTE: Just because your code is crashing doesn't mean you don't have the entities.  Even if you have all the entities you code can crash for other reasons.  It's best to run it in the MSVC Debug mode to catch where it's crashing.
