I'm not sure what you are asking.  What is 'Y' and 'U' usually bound to?  I pretty much rebind all the keys to something else and have no idea what 'Y' and 'U' is supposed to be.

What I was going to say was when you type a message,  if there was a way to search for words in the message during the duration.

There is a way to search through the message before it gets sent to the Half-Life engine.  Intercept the pfnMessageBegin() and pfnWriteString() functions and you can scan through the message text before it gets sent to a client.  You can modify the text if you want and send your modified version instead of the original if you want to.  This is the way that Admin MOD handles filters for "naughty words".

Is this the type of thing you were trying to do?

Yes botman thanx a-mil!

But can you provide some snipplet code of how this is done?

I know about pfnMessageBegin() and pfnWriteString().  I just don't know what to really do?

I want to check for commands like:
"!admin",
"!kick name",
"!ban name",
"!time"

Can you give me an example?
Thanx

I would have a look at the pfnMessageBegin() and pfnWriteString() functions (engine.cpp) plus any parameters needed inside it (i.e. int msg_dest, int msg_type, const float *pOrigin, edict_t *ed)

They variable names may tell u something about it. I take it that msg_dest is for ALL or for one client and msg_type may hold the string in it..???

There's an example in the HPB bot template code where text messages are intercepted for Frontline Force.  Take a look at the BotClient_FLF_TextMsg() function in bot_client.cpp and look in engine.cpp where the TextMsg function is hooked.
