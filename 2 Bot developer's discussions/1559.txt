I can now spawn the bots in firearms.

But after they died, they cannot respawn. How can I respawn them? I tried looking in the bot_think()
but have no idea how to implement it. 
The problem with firearms is u must select 3 choices of configuration for yourself, each time after u died( weapons, items or classes) and there's a screen for that(but not vgui).

This means I have to send a fakeclientcommand to select it.But the problem is I dont really know how the HPB bot actually checks for death and respawn stuff.

Another thing is the bots dont shoot at the opposite team members. How do I make them know that they know who the enemy is?

Any help would be appreciated.

This is from BotThink() in the bot.cpp file...
code:
   // if the bot is dead, randomly press fire to respawn...
   if ((pEdict->v.health < 1) || (pEdict->v.deadflag != DEAD_NO))
   {
      // DO YOUR RESPAWN STUFF HERE!!!
   }

...like the comment says, "if the bot is dead..."

"Another thing is the bots dont shoot at the opposite team members"

You'll have to determine what identifies them as being on one team or another.  In TFC they use the pev->team variable (pEdict->v.team in HPB bot code).  team==0 is the blue team.  team==1 is the red team.

Gooseman decided not to use pev->team in Counter-Strike.  The best method I could come up with for checking which team a player is on was to examine the model the player was using.  Terrorist's use one set of models.  Counter-Terrorists use another set of models.

Look at the UTIL_GetTeam() function in the util.cpp file as an example of determining the team for different MODs.

P.S. As Eric Bieschke pointed out, the "artic" string should be "arctic" in UTIL_GetTeam().

Hi Pem.....
(check your email)
botman has pointed it out for you...
try to add a simply 'FakeClientCommand' here...
(code's included in my mail)
for the second problem your code should look like this:

code:

int UTIL_GetTeam(edict_t *pEntity)
{
      // Firearms...
 
      char *infobuffer;
      char model_name[32];
 
      infobuffer = (*g_engfuncs.pfnGetInfoKeyBuffer)( pEntity );
      strcpy(model_name, (g_engfuncs.pfnInfoKeyValue(infobuffer, "model")));
 
      if (strcmp(model_name, "red1") == 0)
      {
         return 0;
      }
      else if (strcmp(model_name, "blue1") == 0)
      {
         return 1;
      }
 
      return 2;  // return zero if team is unknown
}


(the return values depends on how you want to do it!)

hope it helps,
k3v

Hey, thanks botman and kevin
Now the bots know the teams and can respawn.

But it seems like they wont use any other weapons 
except come close to me and use the knife. Hahaha, scary though.

I have already put all the neccessary codes in the
 bot_weapon_select_t;
and 
 bot_fire_delay_t;

and also defining the weapon id's in bot_weapon.h

Is it sth to do with the setting of the values in the structures? Maybe like how many percentage this weapon will be used if it is available?

Hi Weng Tak!

be sure that you have used the right weapon ID's (use debug_engine = 1)...
and also be sure that you have filled out the 'bot_weapon_select_t' array correctly. if the bot doesn't find the weapon he's carrying in the array, he'll take the next weapon which is in the array (so if u have forget to add some rifles, or such, and u have added the knife, it will take the knife!).
ahh... watch out that you have entered the weapons in the right sequence... if the knife is at top and use_percent == 100, the bot always will use the knife, for example.
