Excuse me sir, didn't you see "because my friend can"? he won't tell me.......
And UltraEdit can build DLL ( programs ) so I think it can build DLL with SDK

ya but I own it aswell ie I know beter :) it has many programing related features and you can write a program with it you just cant compile one with it thus you need a compiler :)
