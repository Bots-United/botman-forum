Due to assignement problems, I start for the beginning my bots with the template source of Botman, and now that works...

But, as soon as I add a new value (int move_flag; in the struct bot_t for example), only 1 bot joins a team after this update.

I don't know why, but that sucks a lot :(

Please help me !

Did you try rebuilding everything ("make clean", then "make" in MingW32, or "Build->Rebuild All" in Microsoft Visual C++)?

It's usually a good idea to rebuild everything after changing the bot.h header file.
