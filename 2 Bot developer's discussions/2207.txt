Hi...

I am trying to check  for the weapon ID but it seems like I get -1 for it. For your information, I am checking this before BotFireWeapon.

int iId = pBot->current_weapon.iId;
ALERT(at_console, "Weapon ID = %d\n", iId);
            ALERT(at_console, "Ammo amount = %d\n", pBot->m_rgAmmo[weapon_defs[iId].iAmmo1]);

The first result is always -1, and the second(the ammo part) is always zero..

Pls help, thanks..

Does the MOD that you are making a bot for send "CurrentWeapon" network messages.  That's what's used in the HPB bot template code to set the current_weapon.iId field.  If the MOD you are using doesn't send these network messages then you will not have a correct current_weapon.iId value.

When you say "Before BotFireWeapon" do you mean outside every function as in a global variable?

Ohh..

I meant that the code is in the BotShootAtEnemy which calls BotFireWeapon.

ANyway, the mod I'm making bots for is Firearms. I believe they should have sending network messages and id stuff.

Well you will need to have all the correct ID values for the weapons first (IF it is giving you the correct ID for the weapon the bot has) since botman never added the firearms weapon id values into the template in bot_weapons.h

You may have them in already but they have got to have the right number for each weapon, you'll get that from the debug_engine and look in the bot.txt file for the network messages when you change weapon i think. Anyway I think you've probablky done all that already!!
