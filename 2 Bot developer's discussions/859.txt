I ran into troubles when porting my Bot over to Linux I didn't think of in the first place. The Windows Version allocates dynamic memory in the GameDLLInit Function and deallocates all the linked lists properly when the DLL detaches itself. But Linux doesn't seem to have something corresponding to that. Shouldn't I care about the resulting memory leaks ? And don't tell me to use static arrays ;)

Here's a reply I sent to a similar question on the hlcoders list at www.topica.com (Count, I'm surprised you're not already on that list)...

"One thing I always wondered: is there a Linux equivalent for process attach and process detach calls to DllMain?"

This is from the man page on dlopen...

"If the library exports a routine named _init, then that code is executed before dlopen returns.   If the same library is loaded twice with dlopen(), the same file handle is returned. The dl library maintains link counts for dynamic file handles, so a dynamic library is not deallocated until dlclose has been called on it as many times as dlopen has succeeded on it."

...

"dlclose decrements the reference count on the dynamic library handle handle.   If the reference count drops to zero and no other loaded libraries use symbols in it, then the dynamic library is unloaded. If the dynamic library exports a routine named _fini, then that routine is called just before the library is unloaded."

Thanks a lot Botman ! I didn't even know about topica.com, thanks for mentioning :)
