I've found a bug in the way tfc engineer bots work.

The code tells an engineer bot to build/repair/maintain sentry guns. But the code only allows them to work on guns withing 150 units of a sentry waypoint. This means they will often times NOT maintain a human players gun. Unless the human builds close to a sg waypoint.

In some testing tonight I managed to beat the engineer bot to the sentry waypoint in the flag room of 2fort and built an sg there myself. The engineer came along and tried to build in that same spot. Had fits, ran around room and finally got confused and built his gun in the middle of the room. After that he upgraded my gun to level 3 and ignored his own gun. So the problem is not JUST human players.

I'm also noticing some oddity where the engineer only seems to give one whack to sg's stead of 3 as code would suggest... But thats another issue.

Anyway, I think this could be fixed fairly easy by adding logic into bot.cpp in the bot think function. Same as repairing player armor. Just keep checking for nearby sg's as the bot runs around the map... 

I'm sure I can fix this myself, got to think it through a little better. But thought it worth mentioning to you, botman.

Okay, but like I've said before, I'm not going to be upgrading the HPB bot.  Any bugs you fix, you're welcome to share that source code here for others to use, but the only change to the HPB bot will be whatever minimum is required to support new client updates of Half-Life deathmatch and TFC.
