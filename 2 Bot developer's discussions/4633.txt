Im getting some crashing since adding my spy disguising code. What might cause that?

FATAL ERROR (shutting down): ED_Alloc: no free edicts

I'm guessing I'm exec'ing the fakeclient command to disguise TOO often and asking to reserve too many timer edicts. Does that sound correct?

"No free edicts" occurs when you create too many game entities.  MODs often times have this problem when spawning things and then never killing (deleting) them.

I'm not sure how a bot addon would be creating anything unless the MOD code is spawning something due to a command you are issuing.

You can catch this by turning on the engine function logging stuff to see if pfnCreateEntity() or pfnCreateNamedEntity() is being called over and over.

when you disguise yourself as spy under tfc it creates a timer entity. My code seems to be creating about 100 of these per spy bot per second. I'm guessing that is a bad thing to do LOL. 

My test machine is a 166mhz machine with no live players so framerate is MUCH lower. Live machine is a 2500mhz machine running at max fps so I think thats how it slipped by my test bed.
