Hi,

has anyone seen an error like this before:

"MSG_ONE or MSG_ONE_UNRELIABLE with no target entity"

It happens in a listen server before the server is even loaded properly, so there are no bots in the game. It is intermittant, and only seems to happen on certain maps.

All of this information is from stuff people have sent me, I have never seen this myself.

In my experience, deleting the bot.cfg solves the problem. I guess the bot.cfg itself is to big. Because when i remove all comment lines and i only leave the command lines it seems to be fixed too.

I sent some source to botman, but he has yet to look at it.
