Hey botman, 

One of your posts 'warned' us about a coming engine update. This update has not been made yet as far as i know; do you have any idea when it is coming? And more important, how to make bots compatible? (since the posted code was not complete)

Yes, it has.  The Steam only update went out about a week ago.

As far as I know, there aren't any immediate plans (i.e. in the next 6 months) to release a standalone Half-Life1 client update.

I recently recieved a mail that the latest steam update breaks up definatly now with my bot. It crashes, i bet it is the engine update, but since the code posted earlier is not complete i wonder if there is any new information?

Alfred just posted this to the hlcoders e-mail list at valvesoftware.com...

QUOTE:
The recent Counter-Strike update on steam has exposed some differences
between the current SDK engine interface and the one currently used by
the engine. In the process of porting the engine to the 64-bit AMD
architecture we had to make changes to ensure data type size coherence
across architectures. The up-shot of this change is that the compiler
signatures of the engine interface differ slightly between the SDK and
steam version.

This difference caused a crash when accessing the new member functions
we introduced for Czero.

To fix this problem you will need to update your SDK, put the files in
this zip:
http://www.adminmod.org/downloads/updated_eiface.tgz
Into the "engine/" directory (so it overwrites eiface.h and adds
Sequence.h and archtypes.h). These files are formatted for linux
machines (i.e \n line endings, not \r\n). MSVC should be able to handle
these files without a problem.

MetaMod also needs a code patch, the diff for it (against version 1.17)
can be downloaded from:
http://www.adminmod.org/downloads/metamod_1.17_diff.gz


I have posted updated MetaMod and AdminMod binaries that contains these
fixes:
http://www.adminmod.org/downloads/metamod_117_adminmod_25058.tgz
for people that want the fixes right now.



...so it seems the 64 bit AMD processor version has a different MOD interface than the 32 bit Intel version.  It appears that, now, the Steam engine interface is the one used by the 64 bit AMD version and not the old 32 bit Intel version.

I'm sure you can contact Alfred at Valve for more detail.

I will recompile my source with the new header files and apply the changes that where previously posted. 

I assume that using the previously 'engine functions update code' will compile now with it since some definitions where not included , but they should be with the new header files...
 
One thing i wonder is if the bot will still work with CS 1.5 and the 'old' engine (not steam!) even when the code is updated?

No.  My understanding is that this is ONLY for the latest Steam release (and CS 1.6).  It is NOT backward compatible with older versions of the Steam engine or with the standalone Half-Life executable.

If you want CS 1.5 to still work, you will have to make 2 separate versions of your code and make sure people download the correct one for the correct CS version (or try to get a single exectuable compiled that can detect the differences in the engine interface and use the correct one based on that).

We can put code in GetEntityAPI() that will "shorten" the enginefuncs interface if it detects the plain old HL, what do you think ?

Pierre, perhaps.

I got word RB somehow still can work, i am getting nuts about this. Even if Alfred mails us that there are problems, some people get it working anyway.

I`ve merged the code into my bot and it compiled and ran ok. 
Some functions headers had to be changed (long to int32 etc.) and some functions I was hooking (pfnAddServerComman) 'dissappeared' but after those fixes CS was able to load, spawn bots and create those nifty looking shadows (honest :P )

Is this change currently only relative to CS or is it for all mods? I am seeing a bit of crashing today on my tfc server using my modified botmans bots but not on my dod server using sturmbots (non-modified). But its random crashing (tfc), the server actually runs several hours at a time. Only 4 crashes since the 26th. The dod server uses no metamod but the tfc server does use metamod but I've upgraded to the latest version. Perhaps that the problem. The older metamod was working just fine with TFC too since the steam patch on 11/26.

according to Alfred the engine changes seem to only affect CS and not the other mods.

This new engine exists for all mods but currently only crashes under CS 
(because only CS uses the newly added functions).  It is possible it 
could crash under other mods but this change has been present since the 
steam beta so I would be suprised if this was a problem.
All mods under steam share the same engine package, so whenever the 
engine is updated in one all mods get it.

Funny, i have been able to get my bot working with CS 1.6 (latest, with those cool shadows... ahum :D) without any problems, listen server though...

updating source now :)

I got my bot mod to work with the 3.1 version of Akimbot. All I did was add the new functions, recompile the code and presto, I got the new shadow.

I hope all this corrective work gives us more than just a shadow :)

well, thats what i try to say. I DID NOT do any changes to my code and RB V1.0 still works, with shadows and such.

This is weird! :S

I guess I'm running the stand alone HL.exe version - I am not running a steam server and I have not tested my code on a steam server yet, so perhaps that is why my code works with only adding the extra functions - dunno. I am however using the latest Akimbot which I assume has been compiled with the patch headers and with the int64 updates (etc). So far, I have not had any major problems. On one server, the sounds for radio commands are missing, but that could of been an update problem as I get lots of steam update problems (about one problem every two updates). The other server is running just fine.
