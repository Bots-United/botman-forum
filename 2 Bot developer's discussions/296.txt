There are 2 ways to create a bot.  The first way is by making a MOD yourself from the Valve SDK and including source code to control the bot.  The second way is to make an Add-On bot for a MOD that already exists.

You have done part of the first method.  You've built the Valve SDK and created a MOD with no bot source code.  You can download the source code to my Bot Number 10 if you want to start with that.  Simply unzip the Bot Number 10 source code into the dlls directory of whereever you installed the SDK.  You will have to modify the makefile (directions are at the bottom of the MingW32 web page on my site) to include the additional files needed by Bot Number 10 (bot.o, bot_combat.o, and botcam.o).  You will then be able to use "make" to build the mp.dll, this time with bot code in it.  You should be able to create a game using a Half-Life deathmatch map and use the "addbot" console command to add a bot to that game.  You can make any changes you want to the bots use of weapons or navigation or other items in the game.  You would then distribute this as a new MOD for people to play with.

If you wish to add a bot to an existing MOD you would need to download the HPB bot template source code (on the HPB bot page at my site).  Unzip this to a brand new SEPARATE directory (it should NOT be part of the Valve SDK).  Rename "makefile_ming" to "makefile" in the HPB_bot\dlls directory and use "make" to build the HPB bot framework.  This framework will allow you to add a very simple bot to Half-Life, OpFor, TFC, or CS.  If you want to build a bot for any other MOD, you will have to create the map entities required for that MOD and place them in the linkfunc.cpp file.
