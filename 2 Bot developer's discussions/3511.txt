How can I make a bot? Please don't flame me if this has been asked before because I used the search function and the results were useless. I have the Borland C++ Compiler with all the patches and Turbo Debugger. I set it up like the instructions said. I got the Standard SDK with all the patches. I got the HPB Bot source code and now I'm kind of stuck. What do I do next to make a bot? How can I get into the actual coding? Is there a tutorial on this? I don't really know the first thing about C++ but I do have a book on it. I know a couple other languages but never got around to C++.

Read the readme txt file that comes with the HPB source. Botman explained how he got about writing the bot. Also tells u how the bot actually sits inbetween HL and MODs, and how to make bots do certain things like walk, shoot etc. I think u need to know C++ well. Else u will probably get into a lot of problems like me ;)

P.S Botman's site had a simple c++ kickstart tutorial. But i think u better get BjarneStroustrup's C++ book.

P.S. NOTE the DATE!!!  It's a little outdated, but pretty much all the steps still apply (just not necessarily correct links, like use the HPB bot 2.1 source code, not the HPB template source code, etc.)

Thanks for the help you guys. I'm currently reading about C++. Sounds pretty easy so far (except for the hexadecimal and octa-something crap). It's not TOO different from VB. Btw, how do I make the bot dll file from all the files in the HPB Bot source code using the Borland C++ Compiler?

In the HPB bot template source code there is a makefile for the Borland compiler (called Makefile_borland, just rename it to "makefile").

You may have some trouble building the HPB bot 2.1 source code using the Borland compiler (I haven't tried building the bot code using the Borland compiler in over a year).

Thanks again. I spent like an hour trying to figure out where I could find the makefile_Borland file and then I realized that I downloaded the HPB Bot 2.1 source code instead of the template.
