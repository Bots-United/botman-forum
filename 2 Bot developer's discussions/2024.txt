Ok, firstly its aboutthe MOTD net message, bot.txt showed me this:

First Question
--------------
pfnMessageBegin: edict=1767b34 dest=1 type=92
pfnWriteByte: 0
pfnWriteString: MESSAGE OF THE DAY
Welcome to Team Fortress 1.5
Map Rota
pfnMessageEnd:
pfnMessageBegin: edict=1767b34 dest=1 type=92
pfnWriteByte: 0
pfnWriteString: tion For This Server:
Dustbowl
Warpath
Epicenter
Badla
pfnMessageEnd:

2 MOTD messages, I have found that 1 MOTD message can hold 192 bytes, but I am not sure how to daisy chain other messages onto it. Has anyone got this in their mod and is willing to explain? I tried sending 2 messages one after the other but the second has no effect.

2nd Quesion
-----------
On maps warpath and ratsxl I get this error:
"Host_Error: PF_precache_model_I: 'models/metalplategibs.mdl' overflow
Error Host_Error: PF_precache_model_I: 'models/metalplategibs.mdl' overflow"

Anyone know what this means? It happens on map load and only on those 2 maps, metalplategibs.mdl is unmodified.

Take a look at CHalfLifeMultiplay::SendMOTDToClient() in multiplay_gamerules.cpp of the Standard SDK.

You'll see there how it sends a TRUE or FALSE byte to the client to indicate whether more text is coming or not.  FALSE means that this is not the last block of the message.

ah thanks, I noticed that other byte, but noone has a clue on this model thing? (I noticed the latter quesion was unanswered in the hlcoders mailing list some time ago)

Regarding the model problem:

I've seen something like it in milkshape 3D once I tried to compile a complex model.

It seems that models only can have a limited amount of faces. Maybe this is what is happing here.

But it can't be the model itself as it is unmodified and it loads in fine most maps, only those 2. Its an error generated by HLDS at map load, not during model compile.

I have that same model error in a TFC map I am working on...  It always seems to be a random model, that it picks out of the blue, once it told me w_suit.mdl, the only map I have seen use a w_suit.mdl is rock2...  I still havn't figured it out...
