I'm talking about the original one not the metamod one... Well I'm trying to get it to work under CS so i can strip vehicles from some maps....  anyways, I can't get it to load.... It doesn't show errors or anything, it just crashes hl... here's the code for loading the dll..

   if (pos == 0)
   {
      ALERT( at_error, "Stripper - Can't determine MOD (or unsupported MOD)!" );
      printf("Stripper - Can't determine MOD (or unsupported MOD)!");
      Sleep(5000);
      exit(0);
   }

   pos++;
   strcpy(mod_name, &game_dir[pos]);

   if (strcmpi(mod_name, "cstrike") == 0)
   {
      mod_id = CS_DLL;
      h_Library = LoadLibrary("cstrike\\dlls\\mp.dll");
   }

   if (h_Library == NULL)
   {
      ALERT( at_error, "Shit this didn't work..." );
      printf("Shit this didn't work...");
      Sleep(5000);
      exit(0);
   }

but yah, I declared all the dll exports and such....


Second Question: When I do get it to work, how do I make it give all the poeple in the thing grenades on client command????

My reply on the second page of this post..

http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=2670&start=15

gives some code on how to give a player an item, to give a player a grenade you'd say...

GiveItem(pPlayer,"weapon_hegrenade")

as you can see below the code I've wrote how you can do this for everyone.
