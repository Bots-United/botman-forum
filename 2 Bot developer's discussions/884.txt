In the first round none of the bots will have a gun, but in the second round all bots that was killed have guns.  Anyone else have this problem?

I am also having a problem with seconday reloading.  I am trying to use a FakeClientCommand to reload the secondary ammo but it isnt working to well.  anyone have any suggestion's as to a better way to do this (the command is impulse 123).  I am guessing this needs to go in BotSpawnInit since the bots dont start with primary or secondary ammo in the gun.

Thanks

Why don't you just use "FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "reload", NULL, NULL)"? Also I believe impulses have to be done via pfnRunPlayerMove (the 7th argument)

The reason I use Impulse 123 is becuse that is the command to reload the secondary ammo for this mod (paintball).   ill look into the run player move though when i get home.
