Does anyone know how I can tell the difference between a map change and a disconnect?

As far as I know (through the debug_engine) the client disconnects when the server changes map.

I think thats just to solve the bug with HL crashing when bots are in the server. (If you are using debug_engine, then you're using the bot code/dll :) )

Maybe try logging a server (just using normal HL), then change map, and check the log.

run a server, type 'log on', in console and the server will log all data into the file it says so :)
