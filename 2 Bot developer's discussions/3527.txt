i was trying to use FakeClientCommand so that bots could fire "ki blasts" in the dmz mod. This won't work because +beam is dealt with by the client not the server (or so i believe..). This means that I need to use the pEdict->v.Button |= method but unsurprsingly there is no IN_KIBLAST defined in in_buttons.h. Does anyone know of any way to monitor myself playing the game and capturing the data i need to add my own IN_KIBLAST or is that a no-go from the offset...

Help!

It has to be some other name for the same button. Try all the combinations defined in the in_buttons.h and see which one makes your bot perform a kiblast.
