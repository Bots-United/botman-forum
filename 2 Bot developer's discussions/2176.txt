Its not exactly like it sounds.  Basicly you put in all your MOD dll entities (with the LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC syntax) and it compares them with the SDK ones.  Filters out all the duplicates, and outputs the code you need for the lincfunc.cpp

You can see a screen shot here

And you can download it here

For more detailed instructions on how to use it check the "How to use" menu in the program.  If you get an error at starup you dont have the VB runtimes.

I originally made this just for me, because im working on a bot for buzzybots (HL mod), so I did not spend much time on it or checking for bugs.  But i decided that it was rather usefull and it might save somebody some time.  If you spot any bugs or anything let me know.

By the way, if you want to check out buzzybots check out http://www.buzzybots.dk/
Fun game :D

Well if it ain't my old pals from the realbot team?!!!

OMGZ you rule mikej! I've been trying to do that for ages without success!

Oh did u use visual basic to make it? :D

Jus remember... if you put these into linkfunc, scary things happen so u could make your program leave em out.

LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(GetEntityAPI);
LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(GetEntityAPI2);
LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(GiveFnptrsToDll);

Thanks, I thought of a couple ways to do it without having to type in the annoying link func syntax, but I just needed to throw something together fast without having to acually think (cause i was using it for my bot at the time).  But now that i think about it, would be kind of difficult to do.  Not just simple string manipulation.

MSVB6, eh? Adding 

"LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(" + blah + ");"

to the code could save us time typing out all those LINK_ENTIT... etc..

you can edit the exports source code to type the LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC stuff. I've done that myself and compiled it. The modified version of botmans exports.exe is on my site :)

cool :)  So put 2 and 2 together and no more trouble/tedious work of going through all the entities

You can also just use "sort", "diff" and "grep" on a Unix box, no programming required!  ;D

Get those Linux distribs that can be run off a DOS/windows partition. Try muLinux.
