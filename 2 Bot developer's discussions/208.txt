I need to know a way to make the Snipers Charge the weapon and shoot.

I have tried several times but can't seem to get it,  it's either they aim and don't shoot or just shoot.

Any help would be greatly needed.

Thanx

To charge a weapon and fire it you need to hold the IN_ATTACK button down for some period of time and then release it.

Just keep setting v.button = IN_ATTACK every frame until you want the bot to fire the weapon, then set v.button = 0.
