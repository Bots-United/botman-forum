Hi all,

Well, the bots can fire weapons already but how do u actually make them reload if the ammo is finish?

And which function should that reloading code be in? Is it the Bot_think or BotFireWeapon()?

Please help..

normally that should be pEdict->v.button |= IN_RELOAD

Well I still dont know where is the best place 
to put that code.

Anyway, can someone please explain why there's so many "gpGlobals->time" checking to do?

I think this is like important because I get this
fire_delay mismatch bug.

The best place to put teh reload would be at teh bottom of BotFindEnemy (the part that executes when the bot has not seen an enemy for 5 seconds)
