S.W.A.T. Bot - Force Recon
--------------------------

As of 13th March 2001 I have decided to kill off the SWAT Bot project as it currently exists. Instead I have decided to replace the entire system most bot authors use for gameplay with my own version another cool bot.

Styled on CGF for AQ2 by William, SWAT Bot FR will be purely teamplay based and play tactically. Using mission scripts give players the ability to play with bots in new and exciting ways. At last Half-Life will get a tactical bot.

Current bots for Counter-Strike are based on random objectives determined on the fly and some are now implenting "personalities", which will not affect the bots at all in any way except in very special circumstances. Such bots (including current swat releases) are simply deathmatch bots that dont shoot teammates, nothing more. Intelligence is not easy to create, but the illusion of intelligence is....

S.W.A.T. Bot Force Recon Design Info
-----------------------------------

The idea is that each map has an associated plan script, this script dictates the actions of the bots within the world and their plan of action. The script will contain X number of plans for each team, with each plan being a different approach.

Example (CT view only for CS_Assault)
-------------------------------------
Plan 1:            1 Sniper gets into position on the building at the start point
            5 Bots will rush the side door of the building
            Remainder will rush via the roof

Plan 2:       2 Snipers camp on the bridge overlooking the main entrance
            Everyone rushes via the front

Plan 3:            1 Sniper on building roof at start, another on the bridge.
            Everyone else rushes via the roof entrance

There can be up to 100 plans per map if need be, and all of this scripting can be made via notepad (with a little bit of CS to get the waypoint numbers) Waypointing is still the same as ever, but the waypoints themselves are not flagged in any way (except bomb sites/rescue/hostages). The extensions for the files are (seem familiar?)

      .rt      =       Route file (large, built once at level load)
      .nav      =       Waypoints file (built manually by users)
      .tac      =      Tactical Plan file (also built manually)

The route file contains the fromto table from the pathfinding algo and will not be included in the .zip file (since it will be quite large).

Scripts are hard work and I feel any potential scripter should get credit where due, (it takes ~1 hour to QUICKLY whip up a script) so the name of the author can be listed in the file. The files are firstly given the extension .txt and then when a map loads the author simply types "script compile". This will create the compiled and encoded script which will be unreadable by conventional means. This will protect their name and hard work in creating the script file. Waypoints are easier (but needed for the script) and should really be made by the scripter since they will know their waypoints better.

As far as map support is concerned, I will release the bot when complete with support for no less than 8 maps (minus the .rt files to save space) and a large document describing how to create the scripts and several pre-made samples. Waypointing will be documented fully (but its quite easy really)

Thats all Ive thought out for now and will probably be everything for the first release.

Here are my release plans:
      Alpha Version      :      All of the above
      Beta Versions      :      Non scripted teamplay (i.e. answering radio calls)
      Version 1      :      Tactical grenade useage and weapons handling
      Version 1.x      :       Various fixes

Anyone interested?
Suggestions?
Bizzare Flames and Criticism?

hehhehe

Im still working on stripping down the template 3 code to the bare minimum first, there must be a few hundred kb of TFC/FLF/HLDM stuff in there which simply has to go! :)

But then it will be easier to track bugs... so its a comprimise. All my code so far (from the incomple swat 3.5) is actually in a swat.cpp file and my functions are defined at the bottom of bot.h

Nice idea, but ....

I don't know, if that's really a good approach. As long as this tactics are not created dynamically it's the same problem as with the wp stuff. I think the tactic has to evolve out of experiences on a map by the bot himself, they shouldn't be defined a priori. But try it, at least it's a nice experiment

You may want to use part of an idea I decided not to go with: make a dynamic menu system over and above the generic botmenu that allows you to designate the actions of bot teammates.  You could for instance have actions such as "rush", "snipe", "camp" and map-specific destinations like bridge or whatnot.  Then at the start of a round, you could pull up this mission menu and assign a few bots to snipe in a given spot or whatever.  It's not as detailed as a mission script, but it's partly dynamic.  

In a 'bigger picture' sort of way, I thought this might be a way of having humans fight 1 on 1 with a bunch of bots at their command to place strategically in a level.

Well, that's the kind of thing I try getting to work with my 'Natural Language' bot...
It would really be cool to assign tasks to bots, or having them cover you in a *smart* way.
