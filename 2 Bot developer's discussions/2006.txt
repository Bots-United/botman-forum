what the hell does this error mean??? The only code I changed was in bot.cpp and bot.h (At least I don't remember doing anything to any other files) !!!

Error:

"LoadLibrary Failed on C:\SIERRA\HALF-LIFE\cstrike\dlls\HPB_Bot.dll (1114)
Host_Error: Couldn't get DLL API from C:\SIERRA\HALF-LIFE\cstrike\dlls\HPB_Bot.dll!"

and heres the REAL Prob

HPB-Bot.dll exists (case is ok)
mp.dll exists

liblist.game file is OK

I did NOTHING to h_exports.cpp...


WTF!!!???

I found the prob, finally, I had an external float which was CVAR_GET_FLOAT("mp_c4timer") !!! I guess external global variables can't be changed a lot huh...
