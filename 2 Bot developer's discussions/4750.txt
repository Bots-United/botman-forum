i have been working on bots for my own MOD, it's a teamplay MOD with a team-select VGUI, but no class selection. i am working with the HPB_bot source code, i forget which version. i set up bot start game, and some stuff in bot.cpp for setting up idle messages. I also set messages up in engine.cpp and in bot_client.cpp. bots join the game but remain spectators. what am i missing?

You'll need to log the messages that go back and forth between the server and the client and make sure that you are intercepting those messages properly and having the bots respond to those messages in the exact same way a true client would.

It would be almost impossible for someone to tell you what you are missing because nobody else will know anything about what your MOD does when a client joins.

You can use Will Day's logging plugin for metamod, which can log most if not all the game events on the server with an impressive granularity to the HL log file. Else you can use your own logging system ala HPB_bot's debug_engine to intercept network messages. But it would certainly be logged in a more human-readable form using Will Day's plugin, or if you want something more basic but easier to set up, you can use my PMTools plugin as well (see the hook_network command usage).
