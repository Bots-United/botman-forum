Hi to all bot developers;
Hey my name is Moralz and i am,in my opinion,a god bot developer.From what i have read in most of your forums it seems that developing won bots isnt that hard and its low security.I myself have no been making binary bots for battle.net.
On battle.net gateway,for those of you who dont know,has two ONLY way's of connecting,binary and chat.Making a chat bot is as simple as connecting with telnet to port 6112 and sending chr(3).Now making a binary bot is quit the oppisite.This is against all b.net(slang for baattle.net) rules and regulations.They have taken MASSIVE amounts of time and put in a complex log in algorithim.I  and a handful of other have made a bot to get passed this.In order to log in you must make MANY MANY packet logs,study them,send them,then parse packets and pass killer functions which require massive amounts of reverse engeneering.So what are the benefits of making a binary bot for battle.net.Well many,you can join games and send false packets to server claiming to win games you didnt.You can send false packets to players in game to crash them.You can pretty much do anything you want with this bot.Now you might be wondering wtf this has to do with you all and why im telling you this.Simple,I would like to make the best f. GUI cs bot around.seeing as how i already have ECELLENT training with battle.net and thier servers i figure i can own won =)
This may sound a bit conceeded but in order to save me time i would like you botman or make of pod bot to teach me the ropes of cs bots.In return i will give you what WILL be the best cs bot around.Im pretty well known on b.net so you can ask around.I always keep my word and am 100% trustworthy.Also one last thing on top of thankyou for taken time to read this post.To those of you also on battle.net who would like to use this binary bot im afraid its not for release but i will help you develope your own.Thankyou for your time and now give your eyes a rest ;D.

Hi
Just d/l the hbp_bot template and it shouldn't be a problem...although i don't really have a clue if ur binary bots have anything to do with cs...
good luck

Moralz, the bot you are talking about sounds more like an aimbot kind of bot (an automated computer program to "help" the user play the game) or a web bot kind of bot (an automated computer application that sends network packets to a vast number of servers trying to collect information).

The bots we are talking about here are computer controller players for Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress Classic, etc.

If you are attempting to hack the Half-Life network protocol, you have a BIG job.  The Half-Life network protocol uses Blowfish encryption in the packets.  You have to authenticate with WON to obtain a valid decryption key.  Even if you are able to get around the encryption, you still have to decypher the network protocol.  Many people before have tried to create a client side bot for many different things and ALL have failed.  Valve really did a good job at keeping people from hacking the network protocol on Half-Life and I suspect that a client side bot for Half-Life and it's MODs will never be created.

I'm pretty sure that no one on this forum will ever help you in your efforts to do whatever it is you are trying to do.

Thats a bad cheater.. Bad.

Now you visit punkbuster.com and think about your evilness.

People like you are beneath us honest people. William there knows his shit, and has created what is probably the best AI for videogames ever in his CGF.

You come here and tell us you will do what no other person has done. Hack encrypted packets every frame in order to cheat at a computer game because you lack the ability to play.

1337 h4x0r's are full of it.
