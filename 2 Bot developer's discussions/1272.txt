How can I hook another DLL with Client.dll for a test I'm doing. (No it's not for cheating I don't cheat!)

It's basically the same thing you did with tfc.dll for the bots just with the client.dll I can't figure out how to get the code working.

Thanx.

You'll notice in the liblist.gam file there isn't a parameter to specify which file is the client.dll (there's just a parameter saying whether there is a custom client DLL for this MOD or not).  If there isn't a custom DLL then the Half-Life\valve\cl_dlls\client.dll file will be loaded by the engine.  If there is a custom client.dll then the Half-Life\MOD\cl_dlls\client.dll file will be loaded.

When you connect to a Half-Life server, one of the first things that gets checked is whether the client.dll that you are using is EXACTLY the same as the client.dll that the server is using.  Since you can't override the name of the client.dll file it MUST always be client.dll.  If you rename your original client.dll to something else (like old_client.dll) and create a new client.dll (that does some extra stuff), the engine will find your new client.dll and compare that to the server's client.dll and will notice that they are different and the server won't let you join the game.

The only cases where you can create your own client.dll file that don't clash with the server client.dll file is if you are creating the server (and if all of the clients joining your server have the same modified client.dll file).

With all of that said, the client.dll has similar externed functions to the mp.dll file.  Use "dumpbin /exports" or my "exports.exe" program to dump the exported functions from the client.dll file.  You'll see stuff like "HUD_Init", "HUD_Redraw", "IN_MouseEvent", etc.  You'll also notice that functions exist in the client for any client side weapons (like "weapon_glock" in Half-Life deathmatch).

You can have a DLL similar to the HPB bot DLL that sits between the Half-Life engine (client) and the client.dll (now called old_client.dll) and intercept these functions if you need to.
