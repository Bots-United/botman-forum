I'm trying to add bot support for our mod (based off the HPB 2.1 source code).

I've run into a problem, everything is cool, until I enable any weapon besides the knife or pistols.

I get into an infinite loop, and the problem code seems to be when I get to here, in bot.cpp (in the BotThink function):

g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove( pEdict, 
pEdict->v.v_angle, 
pBot->f_move_speed,
f_strafe_speed, 
0, 
pEdict->v.button, 
0, 
pBot->msecval);

This happens when the bots try to attack me with their primary weapon.

Now, obviously the bots attack fine built from the same sources running agains DMC or other mods, so it's something about the interaction between our code and this code.

I can't figure out where in our code the problem is, because I can't get anything to stop when I hit CTRL+BREAK, and the one and only time I got the Call Stack window open, it had shown me that I was currently in NTDLL.DLL, and no reference of any kind to my code was available.

I guess maybe it's somewhere in our primary fire functions, but there's no loops.. :(

It doesn't seem to be the case that the bot code is ignoring the values that I set telling it not to hold down primary fire.

Does anyone have any strategy for debugging all this deeply nested stuff? I guess I can write craploads of print statements or ALERTs all over the place.. just wondering if there's a better way to guarantee that the visual debugger is getting the right context to figure out what function its caught in....

That's pretty weird that CTRL+BREAK won't interrupt the MOD code (I assume you are running the MOD code in the debugger and not the bot code in the debugger).

I'm not sure of any other good way to determine where your infinite loop is other than using the break feature in the debugger.
