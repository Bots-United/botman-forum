I've been trying to compile the HPB bot source code with Bloodshed's Dev C++4. Can someone help me on how to make the .dll file with dev?

I've got that too, and it would be nice to have this information, because then I would be able to make my bot in school as well :)

BTW Botman - it is based on MinGW32 in case you didn't know, so it should be able to compile fine...

Yes, I've seen the Bloodshed IDE before...

My understanding is that it's not a compiler, but simply a integrated development environment (IDE).  If this is the case, you should be able to replace the compiler with the MingW32 compiler available on my web site or use the Borland C++ 5.5 compiler available for download from Borland's web site.

The HPB bot comes with makefiles for both MingW32 and the Borland C++ 5.5 compiler which you should be able to use to get an IDE to build your bot.

Hi
YEs,Dev C++4 has exchangeable compilers.It can't load *.dsw files, so i'm just using it instead of a texteditor, b/c it highlightes keywords..and for compiling i use MINGW 32 (i'm compiling w/o integrating the IDE into the process)..i htink to compile the sourcecode using the integrated MINGW32 u would have to include all files in a new project (i never tried it,b/c it doesn't really make sense with Dev C++ 4)

Nevermind about the DEV I uninstalled it! Now I have MSVC++6. With MSVC++6 do like open the .dsw file then change the stuff around then press build? Or do I do something else. Plz help I'm desperate to learn.!!!!

yeah, the *.dsw file will open the hpb-bot workspace, which means you will have access ot all the files included in the workspace (which is all you need) check in the build menu to set the active configuration to debug then you make your changes and press build. If the active config is debug, the dll file will then be created in a folder inside the directory you found the *.dsw file in.  the folder will be named debug.  have fun
