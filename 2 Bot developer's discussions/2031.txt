Subject: Bots attempting to go back to waypoints they miss

This is a real problem for me, the bots I code keep attempting to go back to waypoints that they miss.

Sometimes a bot falls from above, for example the vent in cs_assault, and somehow miss the waypoint at the end of the vent, so they keep circling around below that waypoint after they fall down.

Are there any examples or any ideas to fix this?
I've tried some numerous things, but they just give me more porblems! :(

Maybe you could make a counter like f_waypointfindtime and update it, until it reaches 10 sec. (or some other number :P) and if the bot still hasn't reached it than let the bot find a waypoint near him and let him go to that waypoint. I hope you understand that piece of advise :P. My english is bad, my coding is even better as my English :P.

Often, it's not really a problem that bots "miss" a waypoint. In most cases, they simply overshoot the waypoint within the .1 second. If you would just check for the __two__ valid situations:
- bot close to waypoint, __and__
- bot not close to waypoint, but between that waypoint and the next waypoint on the path,
you would catch the majority of the problems, and prevent the bot from moving back to a waypoint it already passed.
This involves some simple vector math, but there are a few exceptions: some waypoints simply should not be passed by because the bot is required to perform a special action. Think of buttons, etc.

In case the bots miss a waypoint when they should visit them, and they cannot, you can test for that situation by looking op the nearest viable waypoint for the bot.
In your example, that waypoint won't be the end of the vent (or somebody created a bad waypoint file). 
Second, you need to look up the travel time (or path length) from the waypoint found to the target waypoint. If that path is long (in time or in waypoints), you have a problem situation...
In that case, have the bot select a new goal to pursue.

I might try something like this except not 10 seconds :), I will work out the distance between the last waypoint and the next and find the players speed, then a simple speed distance time equation to find how long the bot should have reached it! :)

Also see this thread about the "loop-the-loop" problem I used to have with the HPB bot...

Thanks. I actually looked for a previous post, because I remembered having discussed this before.
Since I was unable to find that post, I assumed Cheesemonster wouldn't find it as well...

Yup, I remembered it had "loop-the-loop" in the post, so that's what I searched for.  :)

I had the same issue.  To fix it, I save the vector where the bot is stuck at when the bot stuck code fires.  After a couple seconds, if the bot is close to the same place, I create a new path from the waypoints.  Seems to be working so far for when you get really stuck or fall and miss a waypoint.
