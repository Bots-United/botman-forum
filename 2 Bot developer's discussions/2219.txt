How does PB do that, you know, taking SS'es and sending them to the server? I need that code for... my own purposes...
Code snippets would be purdy :)

In the console just type "snapshot" and look for the most recent .bmp file.  Then convert that to whatever format you want and send it where you want.

PunkBuster claims to take the screenshot directly from video memory which seems way more difficult than you would really need.  I would assume you'd have to have different code for different types of graphics modes (Direct3D, OpenGL, Software mode, etc.).  They might just be using Windows BitBlt routines to copy the Windows video image but that's not really the same as grabbing the video memory.
