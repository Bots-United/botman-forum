Is there an easy way to get a direct vector or
angle to a non-visible entity?

I'm thinking about writing a condition to stop
the bot from moving toward func_water and
attempt to navigate around it. Do you think this
is a good/bad idea, has anyone tried this before?

What I'm finding with the waypoints is the bots
are often moving back and forth between 2 waypoints. I'm thinking the way to overcome this
would be to have directional waypoints so the
bot would follow more of a circuit and prevent it
from returning to the previous waypoint.

Kye.

You can get the contents of a point in 3D space to determine if it's air, water or solid.  Look at the UTIL_PointContents() function in the Half-Life SDK.  Search the source code for examples of where it's used to see how to call it.

Yes, it's a good idea to keep track of where you've been so you don't go that direction again unless there's no other way to go (like at the end of a dead end alley).
