I'm not sure that you can, but it's worth a try.  The bots use pfnRunPlayerMove() to get a player to move around and "press" keys (like IN_JUMP, IN_DUCK, etc.).

Try using the edict of a real client in the pfnRunPlayerMove() engine function to see if you can get a real client to be controlled by the bot code.
