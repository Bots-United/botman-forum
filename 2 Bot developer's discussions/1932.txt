OK, i finally finished my firearms weapon-banning system.  http://faplanet.20megsfree.com  Just want to say thank you Botman for making everything open-source and answering the dumb questions i asked.  Oh, and to anyone coding for FA, heres how i fixed my respawn problem.  Look in PlayerPostThink if pEntity->v.weaponmodel is 0.  If it is, the player is dead, if not, they are actually playing.  The deadflag causes trouble because it says they are alive when they are in the config menu, which was what gave me the problems(allowed them to use banned weapons if they delayed in config menu).  I accomplished this with a Win32 API style message-queue system, time-sorted.  Hope this helps anyone else having trouble with firearms.
