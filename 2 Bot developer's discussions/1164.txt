Hello,
I'm working on a mod and have the HPB source modified so it's pointing to my mod blah blah blah and the bots add correctly and they can run around and shoot each other all day long and I can shoot them, but when someone takes damage from an explosion (rocket launcher or satchels, etc) or someone is attacked with egon gun, the I get this:

Host_Error:WriteDest_Parm:not a client

Any ideas??

I've dug through a couple of month's worth of messages here and didn't find anything relevant and also tried searching, again, with nothing relevant I could find.

The "mod" I've got, at this point, is almost nothing changed from the HLSDK 2.

Thanks,
Greg

The bots can receive damage from players, explosions, and the world (falling damage, drowning, acid, heat, freeze, etc.).  Make sure that the thing that is causing damage to the bot is actually a player before trying to do anything with the damaging entity (like trying to send it a network message).

That fixed it!  I guess I was, in my newbie-ness, trying to send messages to the rocket or satchel they they'd gotten a head/arm/leg shot.  :-)

Thanks for your help!
