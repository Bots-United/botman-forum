As many know Im now beginning work on SWAT-FR after lots of planning, and R&D. First off I have ditched the script system (5 hours scripting a map sucks hard)

So where does this leave SWAT-FR as features go:

Better off

The facts:

The fixed script idea sucked a lot, even with lots of plans. So now Im looking towards dynamic teamplay. I already have code that makes the bots Squad up (it works) and I usually end up with 2-3 squads of bots per team.

From here on its theory:

These teams pick a leader (usually the first bot on the team) and then from here the team will get its objective, after a delay the leader will issue orders for his squad depending on the experiances he has had in his lives. Each bot keeps his own experiances tracked and so on for the game.

If the leader has lots of good experiances sniping from certain areas then these will be used by his sniper squad. Otherwise the bots will take the path to another good place the bot has experianced. If the CT's start to get tunnel raped on dust they will avoid it as a team, and possibly one of the squads will snipe the exits.

This should be done using fuzzy logic and the actions being a result of the bots status, but each bot has 3 priorities.(In highest to lowest)

Self
Squad
Team

If the bot is hurt it may wish to break off and defend, since it cannot help squad as a member. If its doing well it may upsurp the leader and so on. This kind of thinking could be applied to every part of the AI and not use the fixed if then AI of all the current CS bots. They work very well, but give a little predictiblity methinks.

CF seems to be onto this, but not in the same way.

I waaant teamplay in bots so bad it hurts my head (its the speed I have ideas at :))

Anyone else have any ideas on this?

*this I posted in the PODBot forum:*

umh... the bot carrying the bomb should say "cover me" about 10 seconds before planting it and then the bots should listen!!
the bots covering the bot/human planting/defuseing the bomb should find a camp-spot nearby. maby a new type of waypoints: "bomb-cover-waypoints". place 3-4 of them were you want the bots to camp while defending the bomb being planted/defused. this is something that I really really really want to see in POD!!
and: to create teamplay, when a bot sees another bot camping, he should find a camp-spot near him. and when one of them stops camping and walks away, he should stop camping and walk the same way.
maby some of them could agree to camp, you know: 

2 terr-bots are walking around looking for those last cts. suddently one of the t-bots sais: lets camp!! And then the other t-bot responds: ok!! then they both find a camp-spot and sits down and starts camping!!

*heres another post I posted there:*

how about if bots had tactics they would follow:
e.g.: on dust the cts would have 3-4 tactics,
these tactics get saved in cstrike\PODBot\tactics\de_dust\ct_tactic1 or 2, 3 etc...
if the terrorbots win all rounds by planting the bomb, the ct's would create a tactic where they storm the bombsite and cover it by camping or just patrolling... or if the cts win all the rounds they would all storm( then the ts would create a tactic were they cover their "tunnel-entrance"(you know, the tunnel-entrance for the ts). maby YOU could create the tactics by instead of placing regular camp-spots, you could place "tactic1" camp spots and "tactic2" camp-spots?

I am going to put an experience system in my bots too to aid with grenade throwing, etc. I'm not thinking much about squad tactics yet, though I though of the idea of getting pairs of bots to protect each other eg sniper covering a rusher, or a rusher keeping a sniper safe from close-range attacks.

I'm not sure about using the experience to choose routes, maybe just change the bots behaviour depending on what has happened in that route instead of avoiding it altogether. My navigation still leaves a lot of room for improvement though, so maybe I'll put that in too. I'm thinking of only having the route thing for the VIP/bomb planter, and the other bots will just take any route and do the best they can
