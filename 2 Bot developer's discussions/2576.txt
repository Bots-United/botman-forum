some AI related stuff

Here are two AI-related presentations/documents I recommend checking out:

- ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/game-seminar/Liden.pptThe Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Computer Game Industry , by Lars Lidén (Valve)
Using Half-Life as an example, Lars discusses the components of an AI system, decision making, tactical analysis and artificial stupidity. Sounds like a great presentation.

Two notes:
Lars did this presentation in November this year. Please note that although Lars describes AI using Half-Life, the actual Half-Life AI was done by Steve Bond (and another programmer). Lars joined Valve after the release of Half-Life.

Lars gives a very interesting description of bit-set based line-of-sight algorithms and maneuvering. However, if you need to use partial cover (and you should in games like Counter-Strike), lines-of-sight and lines-of-fire become asymmetric, and the actual formulas and implementation become more complex. But if you understand what I say here, you'll figure that out as well.

- www.idsoftware.com/home/jan/q3abotai/Q3ABotAI_15.pdfThe QuakeIII Arena Bot, by Jan Paul van Waveren (Id Software)
One of the few documents describing an advanced commercial game AI implementation in full. The thesis provides insight in the overal architecture of the QuakeIIIArena bot and team AI, including its highlights such as automated area/waypoint creation, fast pathfinding using hierarchical routing, AI goal stacks and puzzle solving, and human-bot communication.

If you ever thought about analyzing the BSP, this is a must read. Jan Paul (aka MrElusive) developed the automated BSP-parsing area based navigation system for QuakeII, and implemented the AI for QIIIArena. In his MSc thesis, he describes the outline of his design.

Note: it's a 2.2MB pdf file.

If you're interested in reading more about game AI, why not piggyback on my periodic search work and visit the links page at www.cgf-ai.comwww.CGF-AI.com.

Now you have something to read in you holidays...

cool I'm hoping to do something like this once I get a job in the games industry!:D

Tnxs for the posts William. I especially find the Quake3 pdf very interesting.

For those of you that don't have PowerPoint installed (or don't have Microsoft Office), you can download a PowerPoint viewer from the Microsoft web site to view Lars's persentation...
