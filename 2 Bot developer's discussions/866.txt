Hi dark youth,

why not on your website. it would be easier to find them than searching through a forum...

Yeah, you could have all the tutorials for download... I've never used SWATbot tho, sorry :( (I downloaded it once, but it kept crashing my PC every time I tried to join any bots)

Hear! Hear!  If you're going to the trouble of making tutorials, then post them on a web site somewhere.  You can put URL links to the tutorials in your sig if you want to.  If you post them here they'll just get buried in a few weeks and nobody will be able to find them when they are looking for them.
