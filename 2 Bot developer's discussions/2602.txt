I'd like to rename the DLL file for output to something other than HPB_Bot.dll, how do I do that in MSVC wihtout any problems? usually when I try it it says some files don't match, and the debug dll won't work unless it's the same name as the name it was when it was built?

open the .dsp and .dsw files of your project with a text editor, and replace each occurence of HPB_bot by the name of your choice.
