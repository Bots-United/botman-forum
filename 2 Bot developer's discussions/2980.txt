I don't really know where to start at doing this as I don't know too much about BSP File Format, but I assume that I could use the bspfile.c & .h files from the SDK source in making a BSP Decompiler is this possible?

Well if so I need to know where to start, all I know how to do is load the bsp since it has a LoadBSPFile routine already with the structs I could get information from there?

You should be able to start with my BSP tools.  This will allow you to read the sufraces, vertexes and edges (as well as textures on those surfaces) into the BSP data structures.

The tricky part is converting surfaces that have been split by the BSP compile tools BACK into the original planes used by Worldcraft.  I think the best trick here is to look for coplanar surfaces (they will have the same Normal and will share an edge).  Combine these surfaces back into a single plane and you will have most of the decompiling complete.

I briefly took a look at doing this (for about 6 hours one weekend) and quickly decided that it was WAY too difficult a task for me to deal with.  Jan Paul's WinBSPC tool does a pretty impressive job (even if you have to manually clean things up when it's done).  Give it a try sometime and take a look at the amount of steps it goes through to decompile a map, then see if you think you can generate better results than he got.

Hi Brian,

I advice you too also download Bart Sekura's
hlview program. It includes C sources
of decompilation of a CS .bsp file.

It's hard to find on the net -- but it's 
really worth the effort. If you are unable to
find it -- I have the source around here
somewhere .....

greetings,

Hi spatel, 
  I tried looking for that source for about 3 hours no luck for me so if you find the source somewhere can you email it to me?: bjl667@sbcglobal.net No size limit ok (new email address)

Thanx if you can...
