The bots can already 'see' through walls!! THe challenge is actually to get them to NOT see through walls!

So to get them to ignore walls, find the parts of the code that check for the presence of walls (eg all the traceline functions). Just do a search for 'traceline' and u should find the parts to change...

u will also have to add a variable such as see_through_wall_time to the bot_t structure in bot.h - look at some code (such as the f_pause_time code) to see how to get the bots to do something for a certain amount of time...
