Well i have a very basic idea about waypointing...

If u make 3 kind of standard waypoints....

1. The Imp Waypoint that is the main waypoint w
2. The Ram Waypoint placed beside the waypoint allot more of them
3. The Stay Away Waypoint (put on walls etc)...

The Imp is the fastest way.... Ram is the way that the bots can go bot follow the Imp, but the bot can walk free and min 100 Units from the Ram waypoints max 10 Units to the Stay Away (the bot can go to Stay Away if 100% needed of that)...

The Bad Things with this system:.

- U need to much CPU power

- Only works on small maps if big u can't make waypoints for all the placec

- To hard for a waypointer to add this kind of waypoints took about 2 houers to add the waypoints for Stalkyard...


Why i dont use this for my bot?
I used this for my bot befor but the problem was that it did only support maps like Stalkyard etc and not cs_assault or  cs_torn



Like this I = Imp Way, R = Ram Way, S = Stay Away Way.... ---- = Wall
---------------------
s   s   s   s   s   s    s  s
r     r     r     r    r    r
   r     r     r     r    r
I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I
   r   r    r   r    r  r
r    r    r   r    r   r  r
s   s   s   s   s   s   s   s
