Also...(posted here as to not clutter up the main forum)...about the Half-Life engine, is there any way to use DLL linkeng to implement fog in the same way you implement HPB... like rename my DLL to engine.dll and the origional to realengine.dll or something.  I want to add fog, lens flare, and a few other cool effects.
-As always, your imput is greatly appreciated...

Again... how do I use put code to Create a "monster_turret" using a command in ClientCommand.  
8)I know how to add a command, but how do I Create a turret.
I'm not stupid... I've tried: 
code:
 CBaseEntity::Create("monster_turret", <bla bla bla>);

Hi,

for the func tanks, you could do a find entity in sphere, find a func_tankcontrols(?? i think) and move towards it's VecBModel origin. Press the use key, and then don't move. You probably have to check whether the players origin is between Absmin and absmax for the controls.

You could always look in the bot10 source :) to see how botman did it.

bye,

You can only add effects that the HL-engine supports. There is a file (effects.h?) with the different functions, e.g. Screenshake etc. I think there is a blending function as well - maybe you could use that to produce fog.
Now the problem is I don't know if these commands are client- or server-side. You should be able to implement your fog.dll easily calling the blending-function each frame (put it in StartFrame()) if the command is server-side. If it's not - no idea... You just have to try it out.

There's a slim chance you can get fog working in the OpenGL renderer by issueing additional calls to the same OpenGL driver that the HL renderer is using. That's the way it has been hacked in to Quake2.

See http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/exp_fog.shtml for more info (and code).

Note that far more code was required to have the AI properly respond to fog than was needed to create the visuals.

I read the tutorial, William: Is that all you need to change?!? You can just put OpenGL-commands in your code whereever you want? I'm surprised how simple things are ( in Q2 :-) )...
No, seriously: It would be great if that would work for HL as well, I'm just wondering: if it's that easy, why did they add a special Triangle-class to draw primitives in SDK2? If fog works, drawing triangles works as well using simple OpenGL commands without the need of additional classes. Bet that I'll check that out!

Thanks for the info,
Tobias

AFAIK, setting fog parameters is a global state change for the GL renderer, invisible to all other rendering activities.
Triangles, however, can be submitted in many different ways to the engine (raw triangles, pointers to triangle buffers, triangle strips (sharing common vertices), etc.). Before throwing triangles across the wall and after throwing triangles across the wall, specific set-up and break-down code is executed.

For that reason, it is probably easy to add fog, but you are unlikely to succeed in submitting triangles without the help of the Half-Life engine.

If you're really interested, send me an email and I'll send you the code used for fog in CGF (also used in LTK).

Can you point me to a good source for using the triangle API in HL. I have a need to visualize certain terrain properties in the map itself, instead of using charts in Excel.

p.s. I don't know much about OpenGL, but I know where to find more info: www.flipcode.com

This will probably sound lame but it seems simple to me.

Why not just use the counter-strike smoke sprite enlarge and take away the animation. Then full the desired area with this "fog" voila!
Really Crappy Unrealistic fog that looks shit and will proberbly slow any PC but does get the Job done without redesigning the entire engine

Try if you like cheers

There have been several interseting discussions on fog in Half-Life in the hlcoders e-mail list a www.topica.com.  Go here and search for "fog"...
