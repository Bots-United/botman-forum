I'm noticing quite a bit of trouble by many of you these times, all of you who are trying to port the HPB_bot, podbot or whateverbot to CS 1.6.

Weapons not appearing, crash problems, things like that.

Well, just a question.

Have you AT LEAST updated the entities in linkfunc.cpp ?

:)

Hey, nice to see you're still here Bluesy :)

Well, I said that for all these guys who are trying to port podbot, foremost... can't remember their names. I don't think they have a great experience in bots, hence why :)

I also made a bot for CS 1.6. It is tested in the very early beta of CS 1.6, but due to my 56kbps modem, I cannot download Steam. So I don't know if this works in current version of CS v1.6.

Please test this and see if there are any problems.

I suspect that pfnSetClientMaxSpeed() doesn't work exactly the same way as in 1.5.

In BotReset, try putting:
code:

   pBot->f_max_speed = CVAR_GET_FLOAT ("sv_maxspeed");



or something like that, don't know where Count Floyd stores the client max speed.
