Some days ago, someone started a thread with these same words and was flamed badly. If you really want to see the answers just look for it. As far as I remember it's the only thread locked: they had to lock it to save the poor guy from more bad jokes...
Just read a little bit more in the forum before starting threads like this one. You are not the only programmer starting with bots and most of the questions might already be answered.
