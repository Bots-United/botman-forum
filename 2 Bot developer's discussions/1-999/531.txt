Hi all!
I'm very interestet in AI in HL-SDK and specially interested in your "Proxy"-Bot (HPB-Bot) But I have a simple question: Why don't you wrote a simple class for your Bot like you did in your Bot-Mods? I think that it would be then pretty simple to convert your very good AI from the Bot-Mods to the HPB-Bot.

Thanks a lot,

I didn't make it the same class from the SDK because I would have to pull in all the other classes that the CBasePlayer class inherits from (which is a MAJOR pain and unnecessary).  That was actually what I started doing back in Feburary and March when I first started trying to get the HPB bot stuff to work.
