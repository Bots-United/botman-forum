Hello, i've gotten bots to spawn and choose weapons with FakeClientCommand (i'm planning on doing a random FCC thing so the bots have variety with skin and weapons later) but i'm having a SERIOUS problem with the bots. They spawn into the game with weapons, but STAND there motionless..... I'll paste my bot_start.cpp code, please email me at kefkarules@yahoo.com if you have any answers to fix, thanks! CODE IS BELOW 

#include "extdll.h" 
#include "util.h" 
#include "cbase.h" 

#include "bot.h" 
#include "bot_func.h" 
#include "bot_weapons.h" 

extern int mod_id; 

void BotStartGame( bot_t *pBot ) 
{ 

  char c_team[32]; 
  char c_class[32]; 
  char c_item[32]; 
  int index, count, retry_count; 
  edict_t *pPlayer; 
  int team_not_allowed; 
  int class_not_allowed; 

  edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict; 

  if (mod_id == WHLBOT_DLL) 
  { 
        FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "1", NULL); 
        FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "1", NULL); 
        FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "1", NULL); 
        return; 
  } 
}

another note: 
      pBot->not_started = 0;

i removed this line from my source and it made a difference between the bots spawning, and the bots staying in 'observer' mode, and not using fakeclientcommand to simulate key press to start, while they were in observer mode they ran around and jumped around alot, but were useless to the game. i also tried changing the number but with no result.

first i would just like to say that i've never played wasteland, so i might not know what i'm talking about, but i did port the hpb-bot code to frontline, so i have some experience.  first, have you used debug_engine to see the exact messages that are sent?  its possible since there are no teams in wasteland (deathmatch right?) that players automatically can be seen,even without going through the menus.  If you need help search in the old posts, i know reductor had a good thing about making bots for new mods.  or you can mail me dannywent@hotmail.com
