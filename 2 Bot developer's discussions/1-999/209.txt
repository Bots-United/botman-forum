Hello,
I'm trying to add a console command, so everytime I type in "Bla", for example, something will happend.
So, I opened the ClientCommand function in the dll.cpp page, and entered the following lines above the "autowaypoint" console command:

else if (FStrEq(pcmd, "bla"))
{
ClientPrint( VARS(pEntity), HUD_PRINTNOTIFY, "BLA");
}

I started TFC, typed bla, and I didn't got the message "BLA" in the console!! Why?

Thanks,
   Ben

Hi!

The correct format as i understand is..

else if (FStrEq(pcmd, "bla"))
{
ClientPrint( VARS(pEntity), HUD_PRINTNOTIFY, "YOUR MESSAGE\n");
}

Looks like you were missing the "  \n" at the end of the line... 

Regards!

So what should I do now?

Try this I think that should work


          else if (FStrEq(pcmd, "bla"))
      {
           ALERT( at_console, "bla" );
      }

Did you COMPILE the code and build a new DLL then copy the DLL into the Half-Life\tfc\dlls folder?

Yes, I did.
And I tried about 10 times...

That's not how to present the text menu.  You should do something like this...

char *menu = {"Menu\n\n1. Option One\n2.Option Two\n3. Option 3"};

UTIL_ShowMenu(pEntity, 0x07, -1, FALSE, menu);

...notice that I'm only allowing the keys bound to "menuselect 1", "menuselect 2", and "menuselect 3" by using the 0x07 (three least significant bits set).

If you aren't familiar with using menus you should look over some of the Half-Life menu tutorials on one of the Half-Life coding sites (look at my MOD FAQ for links).

Ok, thanks!
but actually the menu is for me - something with the waypoints - so I want it to be in the console... 
Thanks anyway!

BTW - For those of you who don't understand why botman answers a question I didn't ask, that's because I deleted the reply.
