I have MSVC++6 Introductory Edtion. Everytime I make something a message comes up saying about some license agreement. If I make a mod using This
Introductory edition will it affect the mod?
And one more thing I was planning to get MSVC++6
Professional edtion, but found that there is a standard edtion. Which is better?

which one is better depends on what you're using it for ofcourse. I think Standart Edition should be more than enough for creating mods.

Yeah I think I'll get standard edition, but can I distribute things I make with standard edition.

Hi
I have got this version too and i'm pretty sure u can. The Introductionary version is limited to 90 day use and u are not allowed to distribute programs with it-it's just for practice.
The Pro Version includes an Setup creator and some additional features.

Hey brian L is Enterprise edition good? I can't decide what to get threre are so many good ones out there! Does Standard edition also include a setup creator too? If I decide to get Standard I'll have to wait till X-mas, It's like forever:(

You could also use MingW32. You wouldn't have to wait at all, since it's free.

The Enterprise and Professional editions add support for optimization and profiling.
That's not relevant unless you're really serious about AI, have lots of code, and run into performance problems which you cannot really solve by rewriting inefficient parts of algorithms.

I'm currently finishing up stuff to get the Half-Life SDK (Standard and Full) to compile with Borland C++ 5.5 (the free command line version).  I'll be working on that some this weekend and should have something posted in the next few days.

The nice thing about using the Borland compiler (besides being free) is that you get to use the Turbo Debugger to debug your source code in the DLL (which I haven't figured out how to do using the MingW32 compiler).

About a thousand pounds it'll cost...

I got this copy cheapo a while back. Second hand, and he lost the MSDN stuff.. and the manuals and stuff. Look in a bargin bin at your local Macro store... Thats a goldmine, I got VC 5.0 for about £60 there before.
