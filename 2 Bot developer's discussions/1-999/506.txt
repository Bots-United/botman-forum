Its amazing how no-one has thought of implementing monsters in tfc using the hpb bot code.

It could be very easily done. You don't even have to use the current half-life ai system.

yeah, sorta like the counterlife mod where it makes counterstrike single player.
But like bots, i guess people are more interested in counterstrike

I am in the process of making a basic scientist entity. The only problem is :

Arrgh!
The hpb bot doesn't have all the necessary files.
I'll have to add them in somehow!
