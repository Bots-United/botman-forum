Hi there again,

Ah the bots and doors, heres what i have done,
I made again a new item to BotFindItem function,
func_door. And than a new "bool found_door"
when a bots distance is under 100 to a "func_door"
"found_door" is flagged true.

Than, on BotThink(), the part where it cant move forward, there is a "if (pBot->found_door)",
so it should pause for a while, and it should 
ignore the door which is like a wall to it, so
it wont turn around..

"pBot->f_pause_time + gpGlobals->time + 5;
"pBot->f_max_speed = 0;". 
And the avoid wall..thing. Is the right way to pause the bot?.

Yes, if you use the code that I've got in the BotThink() function, you can set the f_pause_time to the current time (gpGlobals->time) plus some delay (in seconds) and set the f_max_speed to 0 to get the bot to pause at the current location.
