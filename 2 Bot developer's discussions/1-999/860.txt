My fake dll for my TFC bot cause Sz_GetSpace
error(tried to write to an uninitialized
 sizebuf_t) when I throw gas grenade(spy)
 against bots and bot is damaged by it.

Is this meaning invalid temp entity event
format data has sent for fake clients?

Do I must obstruct message sending
from MESSAGE_BEGIN to MESSAGE_END for bot
entity?

No, but you MUST set the FL_FAKECLIENT bit in the edict "flags" field so that the Half-Life engine will not try to send network messages to clients that do not exist.

Hi,I cleared this problem.

TFC.DLL is calling
enginefuncs_t.pfnClientCommand
when client is damaged by gas grenade
for play some sound file.

DLL is playing some sounds by executing
play command like below
"play weapons/sbarrel1.wav"
I make this function don't call for
bot entity.

FL_FAKECLIENT flag may not effective against
these engine function.

enginefuncs_t.pfnClientCommand
enginefuncs_t.pfnClientPrintf

thx

I get this when I try and spawn some bots in svencoop... Ive made tonnes of changes to the code and all is correct.. But that pops up when I addbot.

Sorry, but I got to bring this thread back.

The "uninitialized sizebuf_t" error is certainly the most common error with bots.  pfnClientCommand() and pfnClientPrintf() are two examples to cause a crash with that error. There must be other combinations which can cause that error to appear with fake clients. 

Has anybody some clue about what is going on in the engine that causes this error? Has anybody found a general solution?
