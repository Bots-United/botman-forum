Hope U programmers can help me out here !!

To countinue my question in the "Invalid DLL version" thread, 
I HAVE to make the mp.dll to work on a Half-Life V 1.0.1.3, because I have a standard Half-Life dedicated Linux V.3014 server on a local network with about 30 users. And the newest version of Half-Life that can join HLDS V.3014 is V 1.0.1.3.
Dark Youth gave my the answer, that I had to upgrade my Half-Life to the new version, and that one works perfect, but then I can't join the server! The one solution, is to have 2 versions of Half-Life, but I can't force users to do that, just to play my MOD.

So will my MOD work on V 1.0.1.3, if I make the mp.dll in SDK 1.0 ? and if so, is there a guide how to make the mp.dll, just like the Botman's guide ? (as u know now, i'am not a very good programmer)

Thanx to who helpt me so far, and Merry Christmas.
