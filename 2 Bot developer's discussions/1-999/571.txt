I installed - whoa... - the CS1.0 patch over the beta 7.1. It promised new weappons, new skins, and better animation. What I got is a bunch of rollerskating enemies. I mean, they looks like Ken and Barby, body doesn't moves, they just do this idiotic skating. When they duck, they do it somewhere in mid air, and they look like a crushed piece of bizza. ????

What am I missing?

Note: The latest HL patch is 1101, could it be the problem, or what?
BTW, on CS_ASSULT, I could not buy the new SIG sniper... (heh, the money gets removed of course, but no weapon)

The latest Half-Life patch is 1104. As for the weapon problem.. You aren't using a compatible bot. In order for a dll loader file to work it must export new functions for all new entities, like the weapons. If you don't do this then the entities will not appear. So when you buy them, they don't show up.

Thx, but is still doesn't explain why the bots do this kind of uggly movement. Yes when I tried the weapons with the standard mp.dll, they worked.

So any help on the player movement? - I can only test bots for now, and nor mine, neithre other bots moves normally.
