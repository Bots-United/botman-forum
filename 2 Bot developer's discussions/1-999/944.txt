What do you people think are good things to make the bot head for?

At the moment my bot has a net of waypoints, and uses DFS to work out the fastest way to get from A to B.  I think this is more human-like, since most of the time, we have a destination..and just pick the fastest way to get there.

But what I need to work out now..is where to make them head to.  I could make them head straight for the enemey everytime, but that seems kinda like cheating.  I had some sort of vengance thing setup, where it would head for whoever killed them last time.  But that too is kinda cheating.  Obviously one thing they need to do is head towards the bomb sites when a bomb is laid...check the closest one first..then the next one..etc.

What else can you people think of?

I think the most important question is what mod is your bot for?  If its cs you might want it to head to a bomb site or if its tfc maybe head for the flag, SI go try to get other teams scientists.  you get my point.  And besides, heading right for the enemies is no fun, and not very realistic.  I would just say, what do you head for when you play that mod?

Also a good idea, if the bots low on health/ammo then head for the nearest health/ammo etc.
If its TFC, and the enemy gets the flag, head to the flag room or outside it etc
The way I'd setup the bots behaviour would be to either be heading towards a flag/cap point, defending an area, following a user/bot. And then fighting...etc. just an idea (could go into more detail if u want)
Write down what you want the bot to do, it helps.

The bot should not cheat - try and make it as human as possible. For example, the bot shouldn't know where an enemy is unless it can hear/see the enemy. You COULD however give the bot the ability to remember where it last saw an enemy and head towards that point (once the enemy moves out of view), or have the bot remember which paths the enemy usually takes, then ambush the enemy.
