When i want to compile the client.dll of the SDK
there is one failure.
In the vgui_teamfortressviewport.h it should be a new definition of "Cursor"

???

So i don't get it to compile.

Can anyone help me?

You can comment out the line with the "Cursor" in it.  Make sure you have also downloaded the Service Pack or you won't be able to link with the VGUI library.  Details on where to get the service pack for VC++ 5.0 and Visual Studio 97 can be found in my MOD FAQ...
