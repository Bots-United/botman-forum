How can you find out your cd key #?  
I think my girlfriend threw out my cd case for half life and i would like to copy it down in case i have to reinstall.  Isn't it in your registry or win ini or something?

PLEASE HELP!!!!

It's in the registry!!!

Goto Start -> Run -> Type in regedit

Find HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Half-Life\Settings

The cdkey is in there!

You could even navigate the registry and get the users cd key by somehow using the winapi to access the windows registry.
Fortunatly, there is no mod that does this.
