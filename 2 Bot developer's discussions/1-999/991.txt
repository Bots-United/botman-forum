Is it possible to get the keyvalues of an entity after the map got initialized (meaning: while you're playing) ? I did look through the SDK and the only usable function I found was Dispatchkeyvalue which seems to set the keyvalues for each entity in the map. Ok, I could hook this function and filter all entities, storing the pointers etc. but I would like to check for specific keyvalues "on the fly". Is this possible ?

No, it's not.  Keyvalues are stored in member variables of the class when that entity is created.  You will have to intercept them at the start of the game as the map is loaded.  You can keep an array of the edicts and key/value pairs and then scan the array for the edict of the entity when you need a specific key value for a specific entity.

You are not talking about the physics key values, are you? I assume you know pfnGetPhysicsKey to read out these values...

No, I meant the Keyvalues of an entity (what Botman is talking about). Thanks for your help, now I know I need to hook it...(lots of curses).
