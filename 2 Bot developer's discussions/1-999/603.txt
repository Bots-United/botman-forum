Yesterday I noticed a bug while checking my bot: after some time the player was idle, HL just froze. I debugged the bot and couldn't find anything, so I checked the original Half-Life: it crashed as well. After re-installing the complete game I was very surprised that the crashs (frozen screen) still continued :-(
The problem was that I had my processor (K6-2 400) as well as my graphics card (Banshee) overclocked. Until yesterday I hadn't noticed any problems, but it seems that Half-Life is very sensitive to overclocking.
So before you start debugging frozen screens, first check if your system runs under normal specifications!

It isn't so much HL being sensitive. It's the other way around: few games except for 3D games stress the CPU and graphics hardware so heavily (pipeline, functional units, busses, memory). As a result, more of the hardware is used, the heat increases even more, and the chances of errors increase.

I stopped overclocking my Celery300A after my win32/system directory was corrupted for the second time (each time causing a full re-install of Windows9X, since you cannot repair corrupted win32/system directories). Indeed, it crashed running HL.

Besides, having a slow machine is advantageous when developing AI. You'll notice bad code and slow algorithms much sooner than on an 1GHz+ CPU, and without the need to profile your code.

Another tip related to debugging: if you're using MSVC6, Debug mode, 'Edit and Continue' facility, and your code seems to do wild things, it's time to do a full rebuild of the code. The 'E&C' relinking doesn't seem to be completely reliable.

Well I have my Pentium III - 450mhz O/C to 557 mhz with no freeze ups or anything :)

I'm using WinME/Win98 & Win2000Pro I run multi systems :)

The K6-2 was always known to give you freeze ups and errors.
