Hya

I'm new to the Half life 'scene', but I'm planning on doing my own bot for CS (yes , another one :) to help myself developing my c/c++ and AI skills.

I followed the scene for a while, downloaded all the patches for halflife and CS, downloaded some bots and looked at some source code.

With CS version 7.1 and the FIRST release of the HPB teamplat source, the bot worked fine, but now I upgraded to CS version 1.0 and downed HPB SDK 2 . I compiled it, but when I type addbot in the console, halflife just kicks me back to the desktop without an error message. I've modified my liblist.gam like:
gamedll "\hpbot\HPB_bot.dll"

Is there anything else I should change to make the SDK work?

I would grately appreciate all the help I can get for this newbee question :)

The HPB_bot.dll file should be in de CSTRIKE/dlls folder.

I think that if you are just making a BOT not a MOD, then you can forget about the SDK.

Yes I mean version 2 of the hpb bot code :)


Marcus:

Thanks, but why is that? Is that hardcoded somewhere in the template code? Because all other mods have their own directory and liblist.gam file accordingly. 

I havent tried your solution, but if my liblist.gam says the gamedll is in gamedll "\hpbot\HPB_bot.dll"  why don't I get an error if I start up cs???

Thanks 4 the help, and I will try it if I get home.

It's because the HPB_Bot has to load the counter-strike mp.dll, which it expects to be in the same dir as HPB_Bot.dll

If that does not work there is one more thing you can do. When going to compile hpb_bot.dll make sure ALL the .o files are deleted... That problem occurred to me when I was coding my bot... Here is a general rule.

If you modify any files with the extention .h you must delte all *.o files and compile again.

If you modify files with the extention .cpp you should not have to re-compile everything. (faster but still has the possibility of messing up)

Actually, thats not true at all. It doesnt have to be in the dlls folder, it just has to be a folder within the Cstrike directory. Ive done it before and Ive seen other bots do the same thing. You can also do that with a mod.

Oh, well, I haven't tried it.
The main thing is: it does work if you put the dll in cstrike/dlls, but not if it's in hpbbot/dlls.
