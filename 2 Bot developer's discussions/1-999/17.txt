When using the HPB 2 source I have seen the following troubles:

When I make the bots chat via FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "say", text message variable, NULL); it comes out as:

<BotName> : say <followed by the text>

But no-where in the code does this extra say enter as far as I know!! Paulo has this too...

Also, The money isnt ever updated. If you put a command in botthink to tell the bot to say its current money the bot reports 800 all the time.

I traced this down to the value never being updated when after the call to display the value in BotThink() I set the bots money to 0.

So the value is only updated once.

I found problem one, whilst exploring problem 2..... and this leads to problem 3...

If the bots dont think they have money they wont buy guns under my code.

So If you could tell me what im doing wrong/ how to fix I will gladly wrap my soul in a small brown bag and mail it to you.....

Thanks....

There is already a function in the util.cpp file for using Say to send a message to a client.  Use that instead of the FakeClientCommand() with "say" in it.

Also, since I don't plan on making a Counter-Strike bot that can do much more that it can now, you are on your own at solving problems related to Counter-Strike.  You should e-mail DaTa or Paulo to see how they handle these types of problems (or figure things out on your own).
