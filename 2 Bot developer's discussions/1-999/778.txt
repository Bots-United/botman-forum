I am working on doing the warmuptime thing for FLF.  I know you can "catch" information from the engine and/or console using pfnRegUserMsg exactly how does one use this and how do you know what to look for in bot.txt when using the debug engine.  Like i see it says "The attack begins" using pfnWriteString but i'm not sure how to catch it. Also is there a way to get the value of the "flWarmUpTime" which is displayed in the console each time a new map is loaded? i looked through the whole template code and i don't think i saw an example and after searching the forum i didn't get much help, so someone please help, thanks.

You can retrieve values from the maps files using the DispatchKeyValue() function.  See these threads...

But you don't really need the value stored in the map file if you catch the WarmUp network message.  See the second page of this thread...
