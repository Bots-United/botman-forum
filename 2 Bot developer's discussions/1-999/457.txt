hey, i'm working on some nav code and i was wondering if there's a function to tell how far the bot is from a wall that its looking at.  If not, does anyone have any other ideas how to do it?  thanks.

You can use Util_TraceLine() to trace a line from the bot's origin out into space.  If the trace hits an object (like a wall or player), the trace result will return a flFraction LESS than 1.0.

To use the function you specify a starting point (the bot's origin) and an ending point (lets say 1000 units away).  If there is something in the way of the trace then flFraction indicates the fraction of the distance the trace was able to go.  For example, if flFraction = 0.25 then you know that 1/4 of the way from the start to the end the trace was blocked by something.  You can tell what blocked the trace by looking at the pHit->classname part of the TraceResult structure.

You need to get one of those little laser do-dads that Norm Abrahm uses on This Old House! :)

Thanks for the help, and as always, hail the great botman who lets all us geeks mess around with his source code :)

one more thing.  Does anyone know how long "a unit" is.  like if i found out using the traceline function that i'm 50 units from the wall, am i close to the wall or what?  like how long does it take a bot to travel one unit at full speed?  thanks again

According to all of the Half-Life mapping documents that I've found (and info from Valve)...

1 unit = 1 inch

Player = 72 units high = 6 feet

World = 8192 units across = 674.333 feet

Players/bots deathmatch speed = 270 units per second = 22.5 ft/sec = 15.34 mi/hr

I can run at 15.34 miles per hour (for short distances) then I have to stop, rest a bit, and have a beer.  ;)
