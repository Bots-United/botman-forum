Erm, i  applied the patches, but when i compile the sdk, i get an error on the first unit...

Anyone know any possible reasons?

Oh, by the way botman, i think theres an option(at least in borland c++ builder) to turn off generating an underscore before exported functions.

It would help if you actually showed what the error was!  :)

Turning off the underscores also turns off underscores for standard C functions like strcmp, atoi, memcpy, etc.  Then the linker can't find these functions (since they are _strcmp, _atoi, _mempcy in the C libraries).

Adding the "aliases" in the .def file was the only way I could export functions without a leading underscore.

hmm... maybe you could have added aliases to the standard c functions? {^_^}
maybe theres a patch to solve this "bug"?

Have you looked in the .cfg files.

bcc32.cfg and ilink32.cfg

you must change the directory in those files
to your directory where you installed borland
maybe that's it.
