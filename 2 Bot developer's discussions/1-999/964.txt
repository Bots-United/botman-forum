Lo ppl.
I've got far too much spair time on me hands, and I've just got into bot construction (nice)
Basically, I can't be asked to make my own bot, but I'd love to help develop anything for anyone else. Not to hot on bot specifics yet, but I managed to create my own routene for bot navigation on botmans HPB bot v2 templete in about 3hours (*brag mode*) ahem..

Just wanna do somthing, as its interesting to me. (sad, I know) :)
Just thought that I could help in the spirit of development. 

Let us know what ya think.

Now, lets see.. am I gonna be spamed or flodded? hmm

Since you got spare time on your hands can u help me with this? (It's not about bots though). I tried to create app. but keep getting that 1 error!

BOOL: CDay2Dlg::OnInitDialog()
{
     CDialog::OnInitDialog();

.
.
.

     // TODO: Add extra initialization here

     ////////////////////////

     // Put a default message in the message edit
     m_strMessage = "Place a message here";

     // Set all of the checked boxes to checked
     m_bShowMsg = TRUE;
     m_bShowPgm = TRUE;
     m_bEnableMsg = TRUE;
     m_bEnablePgm = TRUE;

     // Update the dialog with the values
     UpDate(FALSE);

     ///////////////////////
     // MY CODE ENDS HERE
     ///////////////////////

     return TRUE; // return TRUE  unless you set-
-the focus to a control
}

The error I'm getting says missing';' before'.'
I don't know whats wrong I put the ; before the.
HELP!

'BOOL: CDay2Dlg::OnInitDialog()'
I don't know if this fixes your problem, but the ':' centainly doesn't belong there (before BOOL)

Yup....too much spare time.....yup.

Ok zero, does your program contain those dots or was that just representing somthing else (just want to get it straight in me head like)
If it is dots...try //.
:)
Is that all the code? ah, I remeber when I used to fix ppl's programs with the same sorta error way back when at collage...hmmmm....ahem..
Don't give up, just take a break :)

Zach...really?! /-] don't know that language... ah is it MS assembler v6.66???
bah

Dan, sounds like fun :)) your fine until I get bored ;P

Please show us your navigation code :) hehe

well you don't have to just to let us look it over and maybe test it :)

Ok, the nav code I've done isn't that good, but it may offer some ideas... 
First the bot finds the nearest waypoint and heads towwards it, then (if I remeber right) as soon as its near it it heads towwards a connecting waypoint. Not exactly following a path, but its not bad for just messing with.
Oh, its all done using botmans template v2
Its kept crashing when I tryed to use the in build path finder, so I'll probably write my own (and why not  :) )
In fact I'll probably write my own bot now... its easier than I thought... well it it too me..

(bot_navigate.cpp)

bool BotFindWaypoint( bot_t *pBot )
{
   // Do whatever you want here to find the next waypoint that the
   // bot should head towards
int i;
      edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;
      if (pBot->curr_waypoint_index!=-1)
      {
            if(pBot->prev_waypoint_index[0]!=pBot->prev_waypoint_index[1])
                  pBot->prev_waypoint_index[1]=pBot->prev_waypoint_index[0];
            pBot->prev_waypoint_index[0]=pBot->curr_waypoint_index;
      }
  if (pBot->curr_waypoint_index == -1)
  {
     // find the nearest visible waypoint
     i = WaypointFindNearest(pEdict, REACHABLE_RANGE, pBot->bot_team);

     if (i != -1)
     {
        Vector v_direction = waypoints[i].origin - pEdict->v.origin;

        Vector bot_angles = UTIL_VecToAngles( v_direction );

        pBot->idle_angle = bot_angles.y;
         pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = pBot->idle_angle + RANDOM_FLOAT(0.0, 10.0) - 5.0;

         BotFixIdealYaw(pEdict);
            BotChangeYaw( pBot, pEdict->v.yaw_speed*2);
            pBot->curr_waypoint_index=i;
            return true;
     }
     else
       {
        //pBot->idle_angle = pEdict->v.v_angle.y;
            //pBot->curr_waypoint_index = -1;
          return FALSE;  // couldn't find a waypoint
       }
  }
  else
  {
     // find the nearest visible waypoint
     i = WaypointFindNearest(pEdict, REACHABLE_RANGE, pBot->bot_team);

     if (i != -1 && i!=pBot->prev_waypoint_index[0] && i!=pBot->prev_waypoint_index[1])
     {
        Vector v_direction = waypoints[i].origin - pEdict->v.origin;

        Vector bot_angles = UTIL_VecToAngles( v_direction );

        pBot->idle_angle = bot_angles.y;
         pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = pBot->idle_angle + RANDOM_FLOAT(0.0, 10.0) - 5.0;

         BotFixIdealYaw(pEdict);
            BotChangeYaw( pBot, pEdict->v.yaw_speed*2);
            pBot->curr_waypoint_index=i;
            return true;
     }
     else
       {
        //pBot->idle_angle = pEdict->v.v_angle.y;
            //pBot->curr_waypoint_index = -1;
          return FALSE;  // couldn't find a waypoint

Quite simple - but the worst case is running in a circle with > 3 wps for a long time - this's nice if u'r bored.
U said u've a lot of time and u're a programmer - I exspected something better to come out - this stuff above is just the work of 1 hour when u r not familiar with the template code!!!

Unfortunately I'm not admin - then this thread would have been moved to the "whiner's" forum ...

Yup, but I've actually decided to start working on my own bot now so I'll improove the nav in a bit.
Not bad considering it was the first thing I did :)
Just for reference, I've got the bot to follow me about (if u ask it to with say), It's great to get your entire team to follow u and whup the other team.hehe
Still the path finding/following is the only bit thats gonna be a challange... give me 2weeks :)

First in Bot_client:

add this (in the cs_vgui_menu function):

else if ((*(int *)p) == 28)
 bots[bot_index].start_action = MSG_CS_BUY;
      
else if ((*(int *)p) == 29)
 bots[bot_index].start_action = MSG_CS_BUY_PISTOL;

Then in bot.h:
add this(in menu definitions):

#define MSG_CS_BUY          5
#define MSG_CS_BUY_PISTOL   6

Then the actual code:):
add this in bot.cpp (in the bot think function):

if (mod_id == CSTRIKE_DLL)
{
   BotBuy(pBot);
}

Then make another function:
BotBuy( bot_t *pBot);
And put it in bot_utils.h

Then in bot_combat.cpp add this:

void BotBuy( bot_t *pBot )
{
edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict; 
int money = pBot->bot_money;
char secon_weapon[32];
int weapon;
                        
FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "buy", NULL, NULL);
            
if(pBot->start_action == MSG_CS_BUY)
{
 pBot->start_action = MSG_CS_IDLE;
                  
 FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "1", NULL);
                  
  if((money > 750) && (pBot->start_action == MSG_CS_BUY_PISTOL))
  {
  weapon = 1;
                  
  if( weapon == 1 )
   strcpy(secon_weapon, "1");
            
  FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", secon_weapon, NULL);
                  
  return;
  }
  else
  {
  FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "7", NULL);
                  
  return;
  }
 }      
 return;
}

clean compile if you are using mingW32 or Borlander c++

build all if you are using Visual c++
