Hello 
I made a firearms bot for fa beta 2.2, but when beta 2.3 came out the vgui code meant that mybot didnt work :( so i never released it. Does anybody know the Commands for firearms ? (menuselect doesnt work). 

Thx JamesGutt

It was (i think) vguiselect or vgui_select.. hmm
or vgui_menuselect.. but the vgui was the first word. debug_engine would show the right command..
i dont remember very well..
