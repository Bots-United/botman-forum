hi.

I am trying to make my bots buy weapons. I have came up with a code to buy a mp5.

void BotBuy()
{
   FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "buy", NULL);
   FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "slot3", NULL);
   FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "slot1", NULL);

}

why dosen't the code work? Help me!

i would guess that putting it in botspawninit would work, or at the begining of bothink if you had a flag which made it so you only bought when a round starts

Why restrict it to just when a round starts?  Can't you buy weapons at anytime in CS as long as you are in a buyzone?

Just put check somewhere in the BotThink() code to see if you are in a buyzone and have enough money to buy a better weapon.  You probably don't want the bot buying a weapon if it's currently engaged in combat.  :)

As far as I know you can only buy something in the first 30 seconds of a CS-round. So putting the code in the init()-function will do...

I listened to botman and put my code somewhere in BotThink(its a the bottom). When i compile, they say...

gcc -march=pentium -O2 -w -I../engine -I../common -I../pm_shared -c bot.cpp -o bot.o
bot.cpp: In function `void BotStartGame(struct bot_t *)':
bot.cpp:251: parse error before `void'
bot.cpp: In function `void BotBuy()':
bot.cpp:253: confused by earlier errors, bailing out
C:\MINGW32\BIN\MAKE.EXE: *** [bot.o] Error 1

So whats the big prob?

You can't put a function inside another function.  Put the BotBuy() function somewhere outside the BotThink() function, but put the code that calls the BotBuy() function inside the BotThink() function.

See your C or C++ book for more details on functions.
