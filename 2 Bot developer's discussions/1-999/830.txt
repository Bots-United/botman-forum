I'm wondering whether there's a CS bot with code included. No, I'm not gonna steal your code or whatever, I'm new at this and I would like to see how it is to code a bot. :D That's all. 

Anyway, does any of the bots (the free source code ones) on the download page work with CS?

Yes, you can download the HPB bot template source and build it.  There is support in it for Half-Life, Team Fortress 1.5, Counter-Strike and Opposing Force.  The HPB bot template source code has everything in it that you need to get a bot into the game, running around, and shooting at enemies.

Hmmm,
   Is there a good site or article which tells you how to create a bot step by step from source code to compilation and then hooking it with a mod???  And running it?
    I think these things are tough for newbie coders.

This is the best bots howto page I've seen... good work, botman! :D

Anyway, newbie coders have to stick to their "Hello World" apps, until they learn a bit more... or they could disassemble the bot source code and see how it works.

You can see my source - get it from www.teambot.net

It's not got a tutorial or anything, but I've tried to add in comments on some things. I'm a 'newbie' too.

So far I've really just been working on the waypoint/navigation system, and I'm going to work on simple 'terrain analysing' to enable the bots to jump/duck over obstacles/through vents.

After that I want to add in the ability to command the bots over the radio. I [i]think[/i] I know how to do this, but I've not seen any specific code on this forum of how to do it, just a few general remarks from Botman...

N0t t0 be discouraging but the team bot source has lots of errors. Even if u leave it unedited it still wont compile! I am really l00king to

But the bottom line is that u are still very c00l!
Cos stone cold said so!

A few reasons that the project might compile on your machine:

1. I use MSVC++, so the MingW32 project will be out of date by now...

2. I have 3 partitions on my hard-drive, and Half-Life is installed on the e: drive, so when the compiler tries to write the dll, it could be trying to write to your CD-ROM!!!

3. I also keep the source code on the e: drive, so change all the paths in the MSVC++ project settings to suit your machine...

I'm really sorry about these problems, but THE SOURCE WORKS - the only problems will be with the project settings!!! I'm sensible enough to test out my code b4 releasing it - how stupid do you think I am?

The source currently on my site has no bugs that I have seen (no bugs that would crash your machine anyway), and I'll be releasing an update within a week I think (this update will have multi-coloured waypoints :P ).
