Hi y'all,

Well, thought I'd play around with some bots for HL, so why not start with the best site available? Thx, botman.

However, I do have one question: I've compiled the Fodder bot (just to have something to shoot at! 8o) ) and it spawns just fine. (Added name and model params but it's still nearly the same code)

At spawn time, i _think_ the bots are supposed to start running around by them selves or am I wrong here? I can get them moving by hitting them with something (from the crowbar to the bazooka.. The latter, however, leaves them renderless for a while.. :-) ) and they run around, aimlessly like pinball balls. Are they supposed to do this?

Best regards,

Casper Helenius, Roskilde, Denmark

The Fodder bot will only move in the direction of an enemy (it can see through walls).  It will run/walk directly toward and enemy until it hits a wall that blocks its path and then it will just stand there.

Yes, they don't detect walls, they don't try to turn around when they get stuck.

The body will also NOT face the same direction they are aiming.  Valve changed the engine code when the new netcode was released.  You used to just have to set the view angles (pev->v_angle) to get them to look in the correct direction.  Now you have to set the yaw of the body angles (pev->angles.y) to the same as the view angles...

pev->angles.y = pev->v_angle.y;

Hmmmm.. That's really weird..

I did a little code to make sure the bots noticed an enemy, and they do. However, they still do not move.

Now I'm suddenly wondering if it's because of changes in the SDK between 1.0.x.x and 1.1.x.x of HL? Could the difference lie somewhere in there?

Hi Casper,

In the CBot::Spawn() function somewhere near the top just add the following two lines:

pev->friction = 1.0;
pev->gravity = 1.0;

That should solve your problem.

Good luck,
Rad.

Rad!

You're the man! It solved the problem..

Now, on with the programming! ("No, honey, I won't be coming to bed this week..")
