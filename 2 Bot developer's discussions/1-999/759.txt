The problems the HPB bot has in finding a capture point in FLF 1.1 is not a bug with the HPB bot code, but a bug in the FLF 1.1 code.

If you start a game on the Rebels team (attacker) and go look at a capture point you will notice that it is RED.  It is supposed to be BLUE!  Once you capture the point it changes from red to blue and when all of the points are captured you switch sides.  Go look at the capture points again.  They are STILL red!  When a Commando team captures them they will go back to blue (like they should).  Once you switch sides again they are back to being correct.

The bots can deal with them after the first round ends.  This bug only seems to happen on the first round after a map is loaded.  I e-mailed Pink about it and hopefully it will be fixed in the next FLF release.

I am coding a work around in the HPB bot code to handle this bug.  I expect to release a fix release sometime later today.
