Arrrrrrg.
Im just starting out with bot coding and im trying to make a waste land bot. Just to get started I mainly based it on the gearbox bot code in the HPB code. I thought to get it working would be pretty straight forward but I guess im wrong. Ive got the wasteland dll set up in my code correctly and ive placed all the wasteland weapons into the linkfuncs.cpp file and everything else is also set up correctly. It compiles with no errors and the game loads and I can run around and shoot weapons but as soon as I try add a bot it kicks me out the game to the desktop with no errors.
So all ive done is made a far faster exit command
AAAAAAArrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggg............

You could simply debug the BotCreate() function and others.
You crash sounds like a pointer error, so you could check for invalid pointers and send pEntity a message, which one is NULL, like this:
code:

if(pBot == NULL)
{
  ClientPrint(VARS(pPlayer), HUD_PRINTNOTIFY, "pBot not valid!!\n");
  return;
}
if(pBotEnt == NULL)
...



Then you could search for the error way faster.
