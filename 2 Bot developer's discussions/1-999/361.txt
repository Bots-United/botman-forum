Your map command is problematic.

Do you know why....

Say it... Say Im your daddy....

The reason that the bot crashes on a map change is because waypoints and or pathwaypoint is on. Simply intercept the map command, disable waypoint displaying/thinking and then pass the command on to the real client command by not adding a "return;" at the end of the code:

i.e.
if (FStr(pcmd) = "map")
{
____turn off points/pathwaypointing
}

There....

It works for me in testing...

I'm not sure why you think that worked.  You can't intercept the "map" command since it's an engine command (it never gets passed to the ClientCommand function at all).  Neither does the "changelevel" or "kick" commands.  Turn on the debug_engine flag and look through the bot.txt file and you'll see what I mean.  You won't see "map", "changelevel" or "kick" show up anywhere in the ClientCommand() function output.

Besides the crash that I am talking about happens inside the TFC dll code (so it's got nothing to do with waypoints).  It looks like it's trying to execute code that has been swapped out.  The TFC code tries to execute a jump to a location that is not in the applications active list of pages.  I suspect this problem only happens on machines with 32Meg of RAM or less (but can't confirm this as a fact).

I get a crash when waypoints are on and map changes

I turn them off

The map changes without crashing

I suspect there is a pattern there.
(Something to do with the SVC_Tempentities?)

I made an alias as a command, thats why it worked for me...

alias dy1 "pathwaypoint off;waypoint off; map de_dust"

I thought you could do the stuff I mentioned, until then my little alias thing is working fine. Try turning to points off and then changing.. It works with your HPB Beta 1.2 for me as well...

You're talking about map changes in Counter-Strike.  I haven't had problems with the HPB bot crashing when a manual map change occurs in CS.  I'm talking about in TFC.  Start a TFC game, spawn 6 or 8 bots, then after a few minutes use the "map" command to change to another map.  Sometimes it works (not often) and sometimes it crashes inside the TFC DLL code.  This only happens in TFC, not CS, not Half-Life.

Ahhhh

Sounds like a resource leak or similar.....

IT HAPPENS ON MY 128mb PC and my 48mb one.

I suggest an exorcism for your bot....

*map loads*

hurraryyy...
