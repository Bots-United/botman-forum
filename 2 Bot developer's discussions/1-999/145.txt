Firstly, a huge hi and thanks to botman for releasing his bots with sourcecode and for always helping people out, nice one.

I've started dabbling in some bot development, nothing serious, just for fun kind of thing as I don't have the time. As with anyone starting out I have loads of questions but I'll spare you all the inquisition and try and figure out most for myself.

I do have two questions if anyone can help me out.
(btw my bot is based on botmans Fodder bot - I thought I'd start from the beginning ;))

1. I get this error when I spawn a bot -
"can't find address: 0593161d" Why is this? Also I think this is what crashes halflife when I run it with the -dev parameter.

2. My bot follows the player but he doesn't face the player i.e he'll walk backwards or sidewards and always face the same direction. Anyone know why? Again this is based on the Fodder bot. I don't know if the Fodder bot does this as I can't run it with the latest version of HL, was it based on an older version of the SDK?

Thanks for any help,
Rad.

The bot facing problem is due to a change in the engine when the new netcode was released.  In the old version of Half-Life you just needed to set the bot pev->v_angle to the direction you wanted them to go and the engine would turn the player model to match that.  Now you have to set pev->v_angle and also set pev->angles.y to be the same as pev->v_angle.y

Just put this change everywhere the pev->v_angle gets changed and that should fix it.

As to the spawning problem, I'm not sure what that might be.  You might do better to start with the source code from Bot Number 10 and remove everything except the BotCreate() and BotThink() functions.  Then add in your own code to make the bot navigate, use the weapons, etc.
