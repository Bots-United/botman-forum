Anyone got any ideas on how to auto generate the waypoints in maps. 

I have a few ideas like trying to locate entitys and placing a waypoint there (if the entity is too close to a wall then nudge it away from the wall). Another idea I had was to fill the level with concave areas, and place a waypoint on the center of connecting edges!!!. Anyway, just wounder if anyone has any good links or ideas they would like to share with the world ;)

It depends on what MOD this is for. If there are entities you have to pickup then you could set a waypoint at that origin. To be sure it is reachable you could do tracelines at a full circle radius (incrementing the radius after each loop) and traceline from the nearest waypoint to the new and back. But I'm pretty sure you still would have to set many waypoints manually. Another (maybe the best) way would be to check the .bsp File itself, but there's heavy math involved...
I do the traceline approach to calculate "wayzones" around my waypoints, but I do already have the waypoints set by me manually, so that I can be sure this waypoint is valid. Anyway, I find this quite interesting, did nobody do something like that ?

The tracing idea is nice but won't work in all maps. The problem is that bots are blocked by far more than walls: gaps and railings for example can't be detected that easily... I had the idea to observe the player's moves to set waypoints and build the path data - where a human player moves, a bot should be able to move as well. Has the disadvantage that the bot isn't able to navigate at once in a new level but needs some time to learn. But this railing-tracing is a real mess for auto-waypointing, belive me...

I created a buggy waypoint autogen system

If the bot did not load a waypoint file it would use my autogen code.

For every entity a waypoint was placed on the floor and autowaypoint2 came into play.

Autowaypoint2 placed a waypoint every 200 units without turning on waypoints or making a sound. The bots auto automattically built this waypoint array when they moved. When there were a multiple of ten waypoints the floyd array was calculated and the bots could use the new points.

It kept crashing, just like this other approach I tried.

1) Choose a random number between (-5000 and 5000)
2) Check if its valid level space
3) Work out position on ground (if in air or below)
4) If there is no waypoint for 200 units place this one.
5) Repeat this 60000 times.

It used to take about twenty minutes to generate an unuseable waypoint field.

But the idea was sound...
