Does anyone know of a good freeware or place where to download a C++ App so i can start to learn it??
Is Borland any good??
Or is MS C++ better?

Is there also any good places to begin learning?
I already have knowledge of VB, Cobol and Pascal.

LOL @ Pascal.

Well a good place to learn C++ is in a house, in front of a computer with a book that teachs you to learn to program. In my opinion, C++ is better but then again, borland is free. I have an E-book on learning C++, but it is 6.5 mb and I don't have a site

You can not compile the SDK with bordland without extensive changes so I imagin its the same with the HPB bot.

Use MingW32(it's free), go look at the MOD FAQ and Building the SDK articels on botmans site it will tell you all the stuff you need to know and where to get MingW32.

Or you could buy MSVC++ 6.

If you just want to make a bot use MingW32, there is a link to it on the website.
