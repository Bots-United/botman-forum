Subject:  Using half-life as a physics Simulator

  I was wondering if I can get half-life to connect to a independent server(non half-life) using CSocket and send msgs such as USERNAME is at (X,Y) and USERNAME says "_______"
   In addition I need to make half-life to respond to msgs coming from that server such as LIGHTNAME turn on.
   I need this for a project that I am working on which is a smart house simulation and I would like to use half-life as my display and physics simulator.

I don't even know what CSocket is, but why don't you code your simulation as a MOD for Half-Life? You could edit the half-life SDK with your own physics engine...

you might be able to enhance the HL sources so that it opens a socket and sends / receives messages to / from the outside 'world'.

since this something not typically done as a mod (unlike new multi-player game rules or bots), you won't be able to find much help on this.

p.s., you most likely have to use the native winsock or winsock2 API, since I expect CSocket to be the MFC wrapper for sockets; getting HL and MFC to work together might be more complicated than just using winsock.

The Half-Life network layer over the Internet is encrypted (on a LAN it isn't).  Here's some info I got from someone doing some research on the Half-Life network protocol...

"Well, just for the info then: wonauth.dll uses El Gamal public key encryption to exchange the CD key info with the Won authentication server. It then
generates a session key and encrypts the internet packets using Blowfish symetrical encryption (same key decodes encrypted server packets).

If you were testing on a LAN, then the crypto must be disabled because you don't authorize with won.net for a pure internet game.

If you WERE testing on the Internet and saw clear text data, then I am wrong and the packets are only cryptographically signed (using Blowfish)"

...you can take this for what it's worth. but the guy seems to know what he's talking about.  I personally haven't done anything except create the NetProbe application which can log network packets to a text file.  You can look at the differences between Internet packets and LAN packets and see where things become encrypted.

I guess I wasn't completely clear: for this application, I don't see a need to use the HL network protocol. (And Botman confirms making use of the HL protocol being impossible).
Berk should be able to open up a socket for private purposes, and have the application interact with other applications via tcp/ip (just as you can read and write files in HL).

This could be used to broadcast server messages to non half-life servers and use them to build up a simulation on whats going on in the game {^_^}

By the way, why hasn't anyone made a mod to dump references to what sounds half-life plays?
If you did that, you could somehow use that data to create a wave file of the sounds, which would AID in making demos with sound.

  Thanks for the input I'll let you know if I can get something working
