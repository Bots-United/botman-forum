Subject: Detecting Level changes and Kicks?

hello again.

Got a question for the "experts".  I've got 2 completely different bots i'm working on in the same MOD. One is based on botmans bots the other on my own framework. 

i've been scouring over the HL code for a couple of weeks to the point of being mind-numbed.

So here is my ? what messages get sent the the players when they are kicked or at a map/level change and how would I go about trapping them (assuming of course the fakeclient gets these messages at all). OR there something server side that can detect these conditions and pass that info on to the correct bots directly.

Also, along the same lines what gets sent to the clients at map start? Again related to informing bots when they can spawn. 

I have more questions to be sure but answers to these will get the mod up and running W/O crashing. Thanks in advance.

When a player is kicked, the engine calls the ClientDisconnect() function.  It's up to you to determine if the edict of the kicked player is a bot or a real player (you can keep an array of all the bot edicts and just compare them to find out).

When you use the "map" command, the engine kicks ALL players, then reconnects normal clients (not bots).  For bots you have to recreate the bot when the next map loads.

Things getting sent to clients at the start of a map will depend on the MOD.  Usually the clients will be sent a "CurrentWeapon" message when they start with a weapon.  There are probably numerous other messages that get sent to clients at the start of a round, again it depends on the MOD.

Regarding how the engine views fakeclients... does it treat a fakeclient differently than a regular client in how, what, or when it sends messages or is the engine completely oblivious to the fact that the client is a bot?

Network messages are sent from the MOD DLL to the engine.  If the FAKECLIENT bit is set in the entvars_t flags the engine knows not to send the message out over the network (since there isn't a client).

The only difference I've seen is that in the engine code when you use "changelevel" the engine doesn't know about fake clients and crashes during the level change.  Valve is working on a fix for this and it may be working in the next patch (I haven't heard anything from Leon Hartwig at Valve who was working on this problem).

Everything else in the engine and in the MOD should treat fake clients EXACTLY like real clients (same physics, same damage amounts, same weapon accuracy, etc.).
