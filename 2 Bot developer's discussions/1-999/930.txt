The HPB bot is mainly for Team Fortress, but it can also work for counterstrike, front line force and regular half-life deathmatch.

A mod bot should say what mods its compatible with. look on its site.

dude andy! calm down..................take a deeeeeeep breath in...... now breath out.......

the oddbot's problem with building sg's right outside its base is a waypoint problem and easily fixed.
