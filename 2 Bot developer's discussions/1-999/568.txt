I'll post some news tomorrow.  I'm updating the HPB bot to support the new stuff in Counter-Strike 1.0.  It took a while to download it.  :)

Why dont you scrap the CS bot as so many ppl are doing it now, and just concentrate on the TFC bot?

I'm not doing any additional work on the Counter-Strike part of the HPB bot.  Some people actually like playing Counter-Strike using the HPB bot (I don't know why, but they do).  Perhaps because it's the only CS compatible bot that works in Linux (that I know of anyway).

Like I said, I'll be posting some news later today and a new version of the HPB bot with a couple of new features.  You'll have to wait until later today to find out what they are! ;)
