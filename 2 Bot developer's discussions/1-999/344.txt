Is the Standardsdk.zip the same as the standardsdk2.0?

That depends on where you get the .zip file.  There are some websites that offer "just the source code" from Valve's Standard SDK 2.0 executable.  If you have doubts check if there is a "pm_shared" directory included in the .zip file.  If there is, then it's an SDK 2.0 zip file.  If there isn't then it's an SDK 1.0 zip file.
