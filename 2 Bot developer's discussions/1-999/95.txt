is there a reason why botmans hpb bot is the only one to work in standard, tfc, counterstrike, and opforce?  is it possible to make the android bot or anyother counterstrike bot useable in tfc?

It is if you can get the source code to the Android bot and modify it to work in TFC, OpFor, etc. :)

I started the HPB bot with the intent to have a generic bot that can play in almost any MOD.  The major things like joining the game, navigation, and weapon usage come first.  Then you add in the special features of each MOD (capture the flag, rescue the hostages, escort the VIP's, plant the explosive, etc.)

But if you don't get the basic functions working first, the rest of the abilities won't matter since the bot won't be challenging to play against (except for newbies).

(replying to the original question):

A generic bot is much harder to develop than a bot specialized for a single mod. for a generic bot, you'd have to deal with all the differences between the mods: respawn / single shot kill or not already makes a huge difference in tactics.

If you could developer good and generic AI, it would result in a very large code base (over 100,000 lines of code), and (due to the genericity) lack the (performance) tuning.

Debugging the thing would be a hell as well. As I understand from botman, some of the "if-statement-rules" are very sensitive to changes, and debugging for a 'rudimentary' bot is already challenging.

There was a 'generic' bot project for Q2 once (called SABIN). It was open-source as well. It failed because:
- the AI was to be used for many kinds of Quake2 mods, but developers couldn't agree on solutions (since they would have to compromise on their AI specific for their mod)
- there was not a single unifying architecture that defined where and how all parts of the AI would be connected and work together

Even porting a bot from Action Quake2 to CS is complex since a lot of the details are different (weapon handling in AQ2 is far more complex, CS has other kinds of doors, smoke bombs, hostages, etc.)
