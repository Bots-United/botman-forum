I know this is off topic but I have a problem.
I've got CS v1.0 and it seems that I neet halflife 1.1.0.4 update. I have the 1.1.0.1 full update instaled and I've downloaded the "1.1.0.1 update to 1.1.0.4", but when i run it it says that I don't have halflife 1.1.0.1. I've tried installing 1.1.0.1 ugain but the same thing ugain.
Eny ideas what's the problem and how to fix it ???

Maybe reinstall HL?

I had to do that when I upgraded a few times:

1005 - 1016 - Twice
1016 - 1018 - Damn
1101 - 1104 - Arrghh

It usually works... :)
