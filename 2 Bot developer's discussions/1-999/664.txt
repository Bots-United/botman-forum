ok i coded in botmans bot 10 mainly for testing purposes and to give me something to do other than killing myself.  now i have defined, mad, whatever 3 teams...when i connect to a game the bots are all unassigned and its probably because of that...so where would i code in or change to code so that bots will join my teams?  ive looked but i guess ive looked over something.

thanks,
