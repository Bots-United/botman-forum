Wathcode have you placed here ?


bool BotFindWaypoint( bot_t *pBot, int team )
{
   // Do whatever you want here to select the next best waypoint.  Return
   // TRUE if another waypoint was found, or FALSE if another waypoint was
   // not found.

   return FALSE;  // couldn't find a waypoint
}


bool BotHeadTowardWaypoint( bot_t *pBot )
{
   // Do whatever you want here to get the bot to head towards the current
   // waypoint.  Remember to handle movement on land, underwater, on ladders,
   // and in the air (jetpacks) if necessary.  Return TRUE if the bot can
   // still get to the next waypoint, or FALSE if the next waypoint is now
   // unreachable for some reason.

   return FALSE;  // couldn't get to next waypoint
}

I'm using an implementation of Floyd's shortest path algorithm.  See the Links page on my website for AI websites that discuss this and other methods of path finding.

You might also want to use the "Search" link above to scan this Forum for "Floyd" to see other threads discussing path finding.
