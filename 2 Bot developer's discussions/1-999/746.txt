I am trying to code the bots to spray logos. It looks like the command is "impulse 100". I tried FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "impulse",  "100",  NULL); but debug mode says invalid command impulse.
How can I get this to work?

TIA

Try impulse 201. This is for logos.
But you cant set the logo name (you will get the default one - that's why i haven't implement it)
as it's setted in external part of game (read registers and first configuration menu)

It should be setted in
g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove

SU!

If you will somehow set the logo please reply

So are you saying use FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "impulse",  "201",  NULL); or
      g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove( pEdict, pEdict->v.v_angle, 0.0, 0, 0, 0, 201, pBot->msecval);

He's saying use this...

FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "impulse", "201",  NULL);

...but he's also saying that you can't choose the logo you want (you get the default of DECAL_LAMBDA6).
