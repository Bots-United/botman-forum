I use this code to defuse in bot think!!!

   if (pBot->defuse_time > gpGlobals->time)
   {
         
         pEdict->v.v_angle.x = -60;
         pEdict->v.angles.x = -60;
         pBot->f_move_speed = 0.0;
         pEdict->v.button = IN_USE;
         pEdict->v.button = IN_DUCK;
      g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove( pEdict, pEdict->v.v_angle, pBot->f_move_speed,
                                0, 0, pEdict->v.button, 0, pBot->msecval);

            return;
   }

They look down correctly and at the right angle.
The problem is that no matter what happens they never defuse it!

They are ducked AND look right, but no defusing happens in the end.

What am I doing wrong.

THIS CODE IS BEING CALLED CORRECTLY!!!! Make no mistake. The CT's see the bomb, look down, duck, press use and press the use key



So what am I doing wrong.

It is very easy DarkYouth...

Instead of using these two lines :
        pEdict->v.button = IN_USE;
        pEdict->v.button = IN_DUCK;

Use this line :
        pEdict->v.button I= IN_USE I IN_DUCK;

In pEdict->v.button, you use flags and if you want to give more than 1 flag to v.button, you need to add a 'I' (I is the pipe) just before '='

Hi Dark Youth

why do you need defuse_time?
let the bot hold down those butons , the round will finishe anyway.

try something like this 

if *detect if bot is in pozition*
   pEdict->v.v_angle.x = -60;
   pEdict->v.angles.x = -60;
   pBot->f_move_speed = 0.0;
   pEdict->v.button I= IN_USE;
   pEdict->v.button I= IN_DUCK;

I don't know the function of

g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove( pEdict, pEdict->v.v_angle, pBot->f_move_speed,
                               0, 0, pEdict->v.button, 0, pBot->msecval);

so i don't know if you need it.
what does it do?

RUNPLAYERMOVE

makes the bot move about in the world.

Remove all referances to it in your code for a total lack of bot movement.

That's really useful, a bot which doesn't move...
