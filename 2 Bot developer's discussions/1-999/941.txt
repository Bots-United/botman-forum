Im making a wasteland bot (well trying) but im not sure how to get it to work. Its a deathmatch mod so the bots code should be based on the valve or gearbox code. but you have to select weapons at the start of the level and this I cant get around please help

U should get show menu messages at the start of every round. To get the name of this menues, u've to use the debug_engine command to log messages to bot.txt ( This approach has been already described in this forum ) In the hpb - code there's the team selection code in bot_client.cpp in BotClient_CS_ShowMenu, p.ex..

Hello, i've gotten bots to spawn and choose weapons with FakeClientCommand (i'm planning on doing a random FCC thing so the bots have variety with skin and weapons later) but i'm having a SERIOUS problem with the bots. They spawn into the game with weapons, but STAND there motionless..... I'll paste my bot_start.cpp code, please email me at kefkarules@yahoo.com if you have any answers to fix, thanks! CODE IS BELOW

#include "extdll.h"
#include "util.h"
#include "cbase.h"

#include "bot.h"
#include "bot_func.h"
#include "bot_weapons.h"

extern int mod_id;

void BotStartGame( bot_t *pBot )
{

   char c_team[32];
   char c_class[32];
   char c_item[32];
   int index, count, retry_count;
   edict_t *pPlayer;
   int team_not_allowed;
   int class_not_allowed;

   edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;

   if (mod_id == WHLBOT_DLL)
   {
         FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "1", NULL);
         FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "1", NULL);
         FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "1", NULL);
         return;
   }
}
