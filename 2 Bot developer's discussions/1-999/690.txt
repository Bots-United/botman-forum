In less than 60 seconds after I had updated my web page announcing the latest release of the HPB bot someone had already downloaded it!

Don't you people have a LIFE???  Are you sitting in front of your computer clicking the "Reload" button on your web browser every 30 seconds just to see if something has changed? ;)

I guess I forgot to post this in the forum before, I was the first to download Beta 3.0 of the bot. I think I had downloaded it about 90 seconds after the release, I know I was the first because on fileplanet it said "this file has had 0 downloads".

Heheh, nope, I have no life. I spend my time at your site all day listening to inteligent talk I dont know a damn thing about.

PS. Botman, did you get the dead squirrel in your mailbox yet? J/K
