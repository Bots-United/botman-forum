Well, I read through the HPB Bot, when i noticed  some annoying lines of code in the bot_client.cpp:


void BotClient_AmmoX(void *p, int bot_index)
{
   static int state = 0;   // current state machine state
[...]
   if (state == 0)
   {
      state++;
      index = *(int *)p;  // ammo index (for type of ammo)
   }
   else if (state == 1)
   {
        ammount = *(int *)p;  // the ammount of ammo currently available
[...]

Well, the static int state is 0 everytime the function is called, so, what's that if/else if thing for? I wrote a little programm to test that, but I didn't get the sens...
Well, I just got into C++ a bit and please excuse me, when I understood something wrong. Also my English is not the best, as I'm from Germany, but I would be happy, if someone could explain me this...

Oh, got it. I'm sorry for having wasted your time and opening a useless topic.

This func doesn't matter for game. Bot will have always proper amount of bullets.

static int state=0;

...means that the variable "state" will initially be set to zero.  Since this variable is also static it will preserve it's value each time the function is called.  The compiler will only set this variable to zero once.  If it were written this way...

int state=0;

...then the compiler would set the variable to zero each time the function was called.
