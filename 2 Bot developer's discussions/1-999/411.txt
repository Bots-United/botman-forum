Did I miss it? I see the MOD FAQ, but I haven't found any kind bot FAQ.

There really isn't a bot FAQ.  There is the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file (in the Half-Life\HPB_bot directory), which contains a few common questions and answers.

I haven't had time to create a bot FAQ and really haven't had many people send me questions that weren't answered in the ReadMe.txt file.
