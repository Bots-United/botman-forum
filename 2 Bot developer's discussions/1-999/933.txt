The new template bot is.. well... really crap when it comes to weapons and targeting. In the previous version, the bots can spot you from quite a distance and give you a good headshot (with primary, if any). Now, you can stand right in front of it and it'll just take out the knife (it's holding a primary gun!), run towards you or maybe just ignore you. :(
