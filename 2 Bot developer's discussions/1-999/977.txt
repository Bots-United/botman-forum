Subject: You can now use vertical bars!

I modified the YaBB Perl code so that you can now use vertical bars in your code like this ---> |

code:
   x = x | 0x5F;


I also changed the [b], [i], and [u] tags for <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i> and <u>underline</u> to [ bold ], [ italics ] and [ underline ] because sometimes [b], [i], or [u] apprears as array variables in the code.  You will now have to type out the whole tag name (not just the first letter).

See the dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/help.htmlHelp item at the top of the screen for examples.

Two Questions.

1. How do i make the bot reload weapon after ammo is depleted instead of 'if enemy not seen'?

   // has the bot NOT seen an ememy for at least 5 seconds (time to reload)?
   if ((pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time > 0) &&
       ((pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time + 5.0) <= gpGlobals->time))
   {
      pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time = -1;  // so we won't keep reloading

      if ((mod_id == WHLBOT_DLL))
      {
         pEdict->v.button |= IN_RELOAD;  // press reload button
      }

2. And does anyone have a more simpler, and effective bot_combat template, i cant get the weapons to change at all, nothing works. Someone please help :( (YES i set all settings right with weapons, and YES order is right, bots dont switch! :( )

I would suggest someting like this:
code:

if(pBot->current_weapon.iClip < 20)
                   {
                    pEdict->v.button |= IN_RELOAD;
                   }



YOu're the one doing a wasteland bot, though, right?  make sure you make a bot_client function to update you current weapon.
my guess is that all it would have to do is call BotClient_Valve_CurrentWeapon(p, bot_index)
just like all the other ones do.  check out to see how botman did it for other mods and you should be able to figure it out

I made dan wendlandt's reload system more adv...
Now it dosen't reload if it has more 4 or less bullets left if enemy is detected:
code:

 if ((pBot->current_weapon.iClip < 5 && pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time > 0) &&
       ((pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time + 5.0) <= gpGlobals->time))        
   {                    
         pEdict->v.button |= IN_RELOAD;       
   }

try 

code:


int bot_ammo;
int bot_index = UTIL_GetBotIndex(pBot->pEdict);

if (bot_index)
  bot_ammo = bots[bot_index].m_rgAmmo[weapon_defs[iId].iAmmo1]



or using iclip if that works
