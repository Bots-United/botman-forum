How do you check for how much ammo is left in the sentry & dispencer.  Also how do I get the bots to aim and shoot at the sentry?

Also I'm having a problem with the team code, I need to get something so the spies won't see through the disguise.

I noticed that the engineer gets a message on the HUD with the amount of health and ammo left. You could check for that.

Hi,

those messages use the special variables %i1 %i2 ect. If anyone knows how to get the value of these, then you could do it. But i don't.

thanks,

So if you write the output of pfnWriteString to a file, it says something like "centry blabla has %i1 health and %i2 ammo" or something?
