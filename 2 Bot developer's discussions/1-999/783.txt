Yes. This is a non bot question. I wanted to ask how do you change the colour of the words in the console of counter-strike. Thanks.

Add this to your listenserver.cfg file...

con_color "255 255 255"

The numbers are the RED, GREEN, and BLUE colors, respectively.

I think that would make the colour of the text white. IF you wanted red it would be 255 0 0, green 0 255 0, blue 0 0 255, purple 255 0 255, etc.

Yes it does (as long as you are running Half-Life version 1.1.0.0 or higher).  You can test it out just by pulling down the console and typing these in...

...for green...

con_color "128 128 0"

...for light purple...

con_color "255 128 128"

...for dark purple...

con_color "128 0 128"

...for yellow...

con_color "255 255 0"

DON'T FORGET THE DOUBLE QUOTES (you gotta have 'em).

does the con_color change for all the clients on the server too?

I would think there are different settings for each PC, changing the text colour on one PC would have no effect on the colours on any other PC in the network

Correct, con_color is a client side variable.  Changing it on the server does nothing.  You could probably implement the "con_color" command inside a CLIENT_COMMAND() function (pfnClientCommand) to get a specific client to execute that command.

what if I ran a listenserver and changed the con_color...would it affect all clients?

No, it will effect only the client that it is run on.
