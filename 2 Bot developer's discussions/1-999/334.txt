I can't seem to download the standard sdk 2.0, 
my internet connection seems to automatically
disconnect, when left idle. I would be extremely happy if people help me. Any suggestions?

Try using GoZilla or GetRight.  They will allow you to continue a download if it gets interrupted.  Use your favorite Internet search engine to find the websites.
