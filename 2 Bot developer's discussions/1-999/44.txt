Hiya Botman, I am trying to learn some C++ and while I'm at it I'm trying to make a bot for CS. It prolly wont turn out good but it's something to fool around with until school starts. Anyways I was wondering how the weapon firing delay worked in bot_combat.cpp here is an excerpt from it.

   {CS_WEAPON_USP,
    0.3, {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5},
    0.2, {0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2}, {0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4}},

I would like to know how the numbers would effect the rate of fire. I realize that they do affect it but I don't know what each number does specifically. Any help would be appreaciated. Thx.

This delay is used to pause between "trigger pulls" on the weapons.  The structure contains the weapon ID (CS_WEAPON_USP) followed by the primary firing delays (the first line) and the secondary firing delays (the second line).

For each line with the numbers, there is a base delay value (0.3 in the first line and 0.2 in the second).  This is the base time for the delay between firing.  Then there is a group of numbers for the minimum delay (one for each skill setting) and a group of numbers for the maximum delay (one for each skill setting).  The min and max values corresponding to the skill setting will be used to get a random number between them.  This random amount will be added to the base delay for the total delay before the weapon will fire again.

For example, if the skill setting was 2 the following would be used for the primary fire delay...

0.3 + RANDOM(0.1, 0.2)

...and the following would be used for the secondary fire delay...

0.2 + RANDOM(0.0, 0.1)

...so the primary fire would delay somewhere between 0.4 seconds (0.3 + 0.1) and 0.5 seconds (0.3 + 0.2).  The secondary fire would delay somewhere between 0.2 seconds (0.2 + 0.0) and 0.3 seconds (0.2 + 0.1).

The higher the skill setting (the lower the skill), the longer the delay would be between firing the weapons.

Thank you muchly hehe... now to get them to buy weapons and I'll have somthing to tinker with for the next few days.

BTW, is it possible to allow them to shoot mabye 6 - 10 bullets at rapid speed, pausing for a few seconds to lower re-coil. Or do bots not have to worry about re-coil?

It's very unrealistic to shoot an MP5 non stop until the clip is empty. It is more possible for you to shoot say 6 bullets, pause for a second and start shooting again.

Anyways that's about it for now.

The HPB bot is just like a player.  Physics in the game (recoil, gravity, water pressure, etc.) effect bots the same way they effect human players.  The bots are a little bit better at compensating for things like recoil since they can aim much more quickly than humans can.

You could modify the weapons firing code (and the delay stuff) to check if the "hold primary fire" flag is set and the weapon delay is non-zero then start a timer when you being firing and stop after the delay period has reached.  Normally it wouldn't make sense to have the "hold primary fire" flag set AND have a firing delay enabled.
