In a strive for realism in my TFC bots i was wondering. is it possible to get the bots to have lag/different pings? I was thinking this is possible by using fake client command and using the command fakelag ??  but with all attemps that i have tried all the bots habe the same ping/ it is higher but there all the same. can i change this so they all have different pings??

Justin how about using the fakelag command and also have it choose a random number?  That'll work :).

sounds good. but one thing im wondering about. would the bots actually lag like a realy player or just have pings like a realplayer without the lag?

I don't know maybe you can make the reaction time look like they're lagging.

I haven't really thought of using the fakelag command let me try it.

I believe fakelag only effect the client DLL.  Bots don't have a client DLL.  You can simluate lag by changing the reaction time, or by adjusting the msec value passed into pfnRunPlayerMove().

Just experiment with the values to see what effect is has.
