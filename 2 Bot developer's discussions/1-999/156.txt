1.  I downloaded the Full SDK.  Does the hl.dll handle multiplayer too?  Or do I need something else to compile into the multiplayer .dll?

2.  How can I use a .pak file?

3.  Does anyone have links to documentation about coding a single player mod?

4.  Say I wanted to 'exclude'  weapons from my mod.  Do I just leave that up to the mappers to exclude that weapon from the map, or can I just remove the file that controls how it handles or whatever.  For example, lets say I wanted to get rid of snarks...what would I need to do to accomplish that?

5.  Lets say I want to add a weapon...maybe later.

6.  I have tons of questions.  I can only think of these.  If these questions were already answered elsewhere (botman's excellent FAQ) just let me know, and I'll re-read it.  Otherwise I'd appreciate your input if you can help.

1. Yes, hl.dll is in the Half-Life\valve\dlls directory and is the normal way most people play Half-Life deathmatch.  hl.dll and mp.dll allow deathmatch play.

2. Download Quake PakExplorer (search www.fileplanet.com)

3. I haven't seen anything except mapping sites.  Check the MOD FAQ for links to mapping sites.

4. You can do either one.  Excluding them from the map is easier.  If you want outside people to be able to make maps for your MOD you may want to remove the code.

5. Read the MOD FAQ for links to tutorials sites.  Just about every coding site has a tutorial on making or modifying a weapon.

6. Read the MOD FAQ and read what can be found at the sites that it links to.

Thanks.  I don't know what I did before, but when I tried to run multiplayer before, it said can't find dll API, so I figured I was doing something wrong, but now it works fine.  

I've been able to edit weapons, which is a good start I guess.  The MP5 is very accurate, and can shoot underwater, with the exception of grenades.

Snarks no longer 'kamikaze', you have to physically shoot them.  (Thanks to coding tutorial I found somewhere.  Shouts to botman's now extinct hosted site "balfourroad".  That gave me a good boost on a few things.)  But now I've gotten rid of horrid snarks.  Also, 'mad scientists' if you will can be spawned at a moments notice.

I'm having fun with this mod development, and I hope can get it to where I need it to be.

Again, thanks for your help so far.
