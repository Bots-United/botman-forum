I tried changing the botskill by adding in botskill commands to the ClientCommand and StartFrame functions, but when I use the console in CS and type in botskill, it will execute my code (I know because it pronts out 'botskill 0') then say 'unknown command' - how do I stop it saying 'unknown command'? I define the command in exactly the same way as 'waypoint' and the other commands...

After executing your code you have to put a return-statement in the ClientCommand function. If not, at the end the original ClientCommand gets called with your botskill-command that it does - obviously - not know. That's why the 'unknown command' message appears.

Like this...

   if (FStrEq(pcmd, "botskill"))
   {
      ClientPrint(pEntity, HUD_PRINTNOTIFY, "setting botskill...\n");

      return;  // DON'T FORGET THIS!!!
   }

Cool, thanks! All I needed was return...

BTW Newbies - when I start releasing my bot (when it's got basic waypointing and shooting), I'm going to release the source too, so that any other newbies can hopefully benefit from what I've learned so far.
  I'm trying to make comments on everything I do, so it should be fairly easy to read, and most of my DIY functions should be simple enough to understand (otherwise I probably wouldn't have been able to make them!)
