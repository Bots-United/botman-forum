I still have an annoying problem, and i can't fix it :-(

I ported the hpb bot to SDK 1.0 (easy), but when i make a bot join a game on any mod, the game crashes when attempting to send a network message to a bot.

Is there some SDK 1.0 function to tell the game dll that a client is FAKE??? nothing is working :-(

Fake clients under SDK 1.0 are almost identical to fake clients under SDK 2.0.  If you haven't downloaded the source code to one of my earlier Half-Life bots (Bot Number 7 for example), you should do that to see how to get bots working under SDK 1.0.  Then use the same sort of code from the BotCreate() function in the earlier bot to create a bot for CS versions prior to Beta 6.5.

Make sure to set the edict_t flags = FL_FAKECLIENT  every frame like the HPB bot template code does.  As long as the FL_FAKECLIENT bit is set, the Half-Life engine should not be sending network messages to these clients.

The bot code i use is setting the fakeclient property every time.
Still does not work. Maybe its me?

If the function table was incorrect, the game wouldn't load, neither would the bot connect.

This is too wierd... I looked at the hpb bot alpha 1 source and it still didn't help.

tell me if you get it to work, i would really enjoy your source then :)

making a cs beta 5.2 bot would rock

Pikachu,

  I had a go, at it a few nights back, it get's in and i type add bot, and it say's "can't bind entity to MSG_ONE" or something like that, i don't remeber the exact message, but it had something to do with MSG_ONE and entitys, then i tried :

- Removing Showmenu stuff
- Removing all the map's .txt file's


and there is not much i can think of that is causing it......

I even tried commenting out all the start frame stuff or what ever it is, and still crash's with the same error ):

Ummmm, you revived a thread that's almost 2 years old!  :)

I would think that in 2 years someone would have solved the problem or given up and gone on to something else.
