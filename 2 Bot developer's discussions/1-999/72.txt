This is the current code that positions the center of the radar display...
code:
   // position the sprite in the upper right corner of display...
   x = ScreenWidth - radar_width - radar_width/4;
   y = radar_height / 4;

   SPR_DrawAdditive(0, x, y, NULL);

   // calculate center of radar circle (it's actually off by one pixel
   // to the left and up)
   radar_x = x + (radar_width / 2) - 1;
   radar_y = y + (radar_width / 2) - 1;

...To change this so that it's in the upper left corner you would just change the first line...
code:
   // position the sprite in the upper left corner of display...
   x = radar_width/4;

...which will position it 1/4 of the diameter in from the corner of the display.

If you wanted to position it in the lower left corner, (it would collide with health and HEV stuff) you would change the first 2 lines...
code:
   // position the sprite in the lower left corner of display...
   x = radar_width/4;
   y = ScreenHeight - radar_height - radar_height / 4;
