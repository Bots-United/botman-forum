Ok I keep getting an error when I compile the source and can not track down whats wrong for the life of me.  Here is the error:

C:\HPB_bot\dlls\util.h(26) : warning C4518: 'inline void ' : storage-class or type specifier(s) unexpected here; ignored
C:\HPB_bot\dlls\util.h(26) : error C2146: syntax error : missing ';' before identifier 'MESSAGE_BEGIN'
C:\HPB_bot\dlls\util.h(26) : fatal error C1004: unexpected end of file found

The strange part is I have not touched anything in util.h.  I redownloaded the source and used that util.h and still got the same error.  Anyone else have any problems like this?

The only two things before line 26 are the include files.  Make SURE you unzip the HPB bot source and preserve the directory structure (in WinZip it's "Use folder names").  Try deleting the HPB bot folder (and everthing in it) and unzipping the HP bot source again.
