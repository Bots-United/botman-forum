Im thinking of commenting and cleaning up the S.W.A.T. Bot source code and releasing it.

I am very worried about people ripping off my bot but since I've done nearly everything I want with the bot I was wondering what your opinions are on the matter.

I have the following in my sourcecode:

Floyd/Warshall navigation algy implementation
Sniping Spots
Bomb Planting - I was the first :)
Hostage Rescuing 
Bomb Defusing
Weapon Buying
Radio Useage
Bot Chat
Fairly intelligent navigation
Some VIP related things
A Knife only mode
Some good unstuck code
Strafing in combat
My own weapon useage system
Flashbang reactions

The big question is SHOULD I?

I'm not sure how I can protect my work however....
(i.e. whats to stop someone recompilling and releasing it as their own)

Make some sort of marking that will show up in hex edit or something, I was thinking of going open source to, but i would probley have terms something like, you make a bot with it you make a open source bot :):):)

But i am still thinking about the goods and the bads about it....

People please list some good points and bad points here....

Good idea to give something back to the community. I have some markings in my DLL to show it's mine. But if you've got the source for it, it's not hard to find and remove it. Maybe you could just use a byte string which is coded by subtracting a hardcoded value from it. Don't use xor, everybody will notice it very fast...
Pros for releasing:
- Botman finally gets something back for his work
- All people could work together to make a satisfying bot
- You don't have to stay up late to have all features in time
- You're the first to release the sources of a more advanced Bot

Cons:
- It's not alone your code anymore
- People will ask stupid questions about your source
- People will try to make rip offs
- People might develop the Bot with totally different oppinions what it has to do...

Keep up the good work, DarkYouth !

i think u should release it or write tutorials for people who want to use it or release it through email so peole need to ask u for it then u send them the url and move the code often so they dont just release it that way it would be good for all bot programmers out there i just want it to look at floyds algorithum i need to implement it

Floyd, My bot isnt advanced........

What about the following protection schemes:

1) what about hiding something in a header file OR addding a bug to a command that isnt obvious to the coder or the user.

2) What if I dont include one of the files (i.e. waypoint.cpp) and just include the compiled file in obj form. Then I add a command to the waypoint load function to echo some XOR'd text. Which would be uneditable.

I will then be the only truely open-source C-S bot.
HPB dont count since it isnt open source any more.

Does anyone else plan to go opensouce?
And does anyone have a good protection idea?
Its lonely out here :)

you can delate the source you don't whant to show and add comment what kind of code should they place there like botman in HPB bot template where he didn't include BotFindWaypoint.

When you make your project open source you have to expect that some peole will rip it off, no solution on that one. If you leave one file in object code it isn't really open source, is it? 
However, you shouldn't look too much on the bad sides of this thing: I think most people will respect your work and credit you if they base their bots on your source. At least the developer community will credit you. Don't forget that we wouldn't be here discussing CS-bots if botman wouldn't have released his HPB-code, and he does not complain that everyone else uses his source... 
Think of all the developers that could benefit from your work. If you think you have got a good example of how to write a CS-bot (well-structered and commented :-) ) release it. You don't have to answer (embaressing?) questions if you don't like to. And you could continue developing it on your own without releasing the new source, at the same time getting feed-back on bugs etc., so you are gaining something as well.

-> I just read William's answer to the other open source thread and one thing definately is true: Releasing the source wouldn't help the advanced programmers. When I started bot-coding I downloaded the sources of Bot8, Phineas Bot and some other as well but I didn't even go through the trouble of reading it - not to speak of analyzing it... Instead I set off with the good old framework of the Fatal which served its purpose well. So if your code contains too many details or advanced algorithms it probably wouldn't serve too many programmers: one part doesn't want it, the other doesn't understand it.
Maybe the advice would be: better don't release it. (I haven't helped you much, have I?)

Of course the bad thing about releasing full working source code is that it pollutes the field.

For every 1 serious coder that wants to improve on your work there are 10 lamers who will make up their own name (usually some combination of their name or initials) and release that as a brand new "l33t" CS bot.  Everyone will waste time downloading it and installing it only to find out that it's no better than what's already out there.  Since the "developer" doesn't really know how to code, the code will probably never be improved and bugs will never get fixed.

If you release enough information so that someone can get started, but not enough so that there will be dozens of cheap rip offs, then only the serious developers will take what you have and improve on it.  Plus you don't wind up getting lots of e-mail from people that don't even try to learn how to code asking you very basic C or C++ questions about what's in your source.

What might be better than releasing the source code is to release bits and pieces of it in the form of tutorials showing how you solved a specific problem (like defusing a bomb).  Provide enough description in the comments for someone to figure out what you've done and be able to use that in their own bot code.

Or you could just release everything as it is and see what happens.  It's totally up to you.

botman's idea of relising only parts of source like tutorials is good !

Yeah, it's good how botman helps ppl but doesn't actually tell them anyting they don't already know - he just sort of points them in the right direction.

I'm going to be releasing all of my early source, but when it starts getting 'advanced' I'll stop releasing it. The waypointing system is really bad, so it would take a lot of work for someone to rip it off as a 'good' bot, but I'm going to try my best to help other newbies, and make my bot as good as I possibly can make it...

One thing that i have noticed is a little anoying and that is going back over your code and having to put make comments for things in your code :):)
