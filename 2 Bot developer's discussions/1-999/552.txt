foreword at BOT SENSES - IDEAS topic

Everything what a bot can benefit from, can help him to play better. Better means: more human like, since they can already have eyes in the back :) and can constantly aim at your head. But this is not what makes a bot a challanging opponent.

the HEARING system:

in contrast to the BOTVISION, the hearing system is relatively an easy part, however in mandays, it might take much more time to implement. As can be read in some previous topics, the server side bot can only compute if it can hear something, and if so what? I'm sure that if a good player can not sense the sound from his/her environment, (s)he would be blinded. The bots want ears!

- footstep sounds based on enemy speed.
- the type of the sound would also be very important since most of the time human players can not determine the 3D direction, only by knowing where the possible soundclass source is.
- weapon noises and shoots must be hard coded (this is what would take years:(
- possible environmental and self made sounds must degrade the level of directional accuracy. (not to mention walls... :( )

finally after the bot 'listens' it will have some more info on the environment it operates in. An interesting addendum on bot AI: We all talk about AI, but what is really missing (IMHO) is that we do not give the BOT enough info about the world. Now, if we implement the above (incl:vision), it will give hell of a lot data, what can later be 'analysed'.

And on the bot skills. I never thought about it, but i think that all the senses can have a treshold value, a slider which can be set to be precise or inaccurate. This way if we have separate vision, hearing, and prediction we can mix a hell of a lot BOT behaviours. There could be 'blind' bots which can operate based on hearing, or a sensitive bot can have a poor prediction system which makes it a very good shooter dumbass... etc...
