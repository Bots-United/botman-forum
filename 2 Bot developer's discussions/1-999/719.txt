(I had accidently posted this topic in the bot problems forum)

I have a couple newbie coding questions; 

1. I created my own TFC bot but one problem, none of the console commands work! Not any of them! Whats wrong there? 

2. What code should I use if I want bots to chat for; 

when they kill someone, when someone kills them, or right before a mapchange? 

3. I tried to make the bots fly but it didnt work correctly. 

Here is what I used; 


// 
// HPB bot - botman's High Ping Bastard bot 
// 
// (http://planethalflife.com/botman/) 
// 
// bot_combat.cpp 
// 

#include "extdll.h" 
#include "util.h" 
#include "cbase.h" 

#include "bot.h" 
#include "bot_func.h" 
#include "bot_weapons.h" 

extern int mod_id; 
extern bot_weapon_t weapon_defs[MAX_WEAPONS]; 


edict_t *BotFindEnemy( bot_t *pBot ) 
{ 
  int i; 
  if pEdict->v.movetype = MOVETYPE_FLY 
  float nearestdistance = 1000;  // max distance of enemy 
  static float is_team_play; 
  Vector vecEnd; 
  edict_t *pNewEnemy = NULL; 

  edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict; 



I put that in bot_combat.cpp because I only want them to fly when in combat. All of that is the code that came with it, I simply added the botfly function. Its probably something extremly obvious, but I really dont understand C++ code at all, I just change things where it looks like it might make sense. 

HELP!!!!

This part doesn't do what you want...

if pEdict->v.movetype = MOVETYPE_FLY

Once the bot has chosen a new enemy (at the bottom of BotFindEnemy) you could modify the movetype to FLY by doing this...

   if (pNewEnemy)
   {
      // face the enemy
      Vector v_enemy = pNewEnemy->v.origin - pEdict->v.origin;
      Vector bot_angles = UTIL_VecToAngles( v_enemy );

      pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = bot_angles.y;

      BotFixIdealYaw(pEdict);

      // fly, bot, fly!!!
      pEdict->v.movetype = MOVETYPE_FLY;
   }

...and here's a thread on what I did to get the "say" command to work...

http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=381

...you can also try using a FakeClientCommand() with "say" as the command followed by the text you want, but other people have reported problems doing things this way.  Try it and see if it works for you, since that method is much simpler.
