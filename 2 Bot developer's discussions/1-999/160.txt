Just wondered:
The HPB already uses buttons etc.
Then it shouldn't be that difficult to implement hostage rescue or what ?

Hi,

i think so too, the bot should just Know the hostage, like a team then just press use once on it. Maybe something like this, just a wild guess.


if (Collided->on->hostage)
 { 
  pBot->pEdict->v.button = IN_USE;
 }

Just think about it for a minute and you'll see that there is a lot more to it. Sure, you can just press the use button to let the hostage follow the bot. But what if another bot sees the hostage following the previous bot. They will steal each other the hostages they already got (running in an endless loop). You need to store the information somehow that a Bot has this precious hostage in use (by storing the entity address for example). Then you still have the problem of a bot wanting to steal the hostage of a human player. So there is much work to do than for bomb planting/defusing and it's not a simple
pBot->pEdict->v.button = IN_USE

Hmm. 

I think that maybe, just maybe. You could try to 
add new "item" to BotFindItem(), the hostage i mean. You can find info about the hostage from
halflife-cs.fgd, the mappers file...

Yes Sakari you're right. Simply add this "item" to BotFindItem and it will work for you. A hostage is a "hostage_entity". Then you only have all the probs I mentioned before, but you wanted it that way, don't you :)
BTW Sakari what's this mapper file you're speaking of ? I really would like to have a table of all entities. The URL you gave isn't working...at least not for me !

Did you try searching on counter-strike.net for "fgd"?  I think that's where I found my CS fgd file (or maybe it was google.com).

Hi,

Well the halflife-cs.fgd isnt an url :). its the files name, if you have CS installed then you have this file on cstrike\ directory, or get it from counter-strike.net. 

This fgd is used to make new maps with Worldcraft,
and its filled with entities which appear on the game. Btw, how does the BotFollow() work?. They dont seem to follow me or each other. 

Regards,
Sakari

The BotFollow() was left over from the Bot Number 10 code.  In Bot Number 10, if the player "uses" a bot the bot will follow the player.  If you wish to add this feature, download the Bot Number 10 source to see how to set up a USE function.  I haven't done this with the HPB bot code because I wasn't sure how to EXPORT the USE function properly.
