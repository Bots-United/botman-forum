How are you other bot authors detecting round changes or roundtime in the code for your bots(in CS)?

I would assume they are looking for messages from the MOD DLL that only get sent at the start of a round.  Look at your HUD when a round starts.  See anything that ONLY gets sent at the start of a round?  (hint, hint)  Set up a function in bot_client.cpp that captures that message and does whatever you want with it.

Hi !

The roundtime is easily captured through the HUD Roundtime message. That way you get the actual time displayed on the HUD of every player. To initialize things, I use the "info_map_parameters" entity which is spawned every new round (and gets called only once, so you can initialize all bots in one go). You can hook this in FindEntityByString in engine.cpp.

Hope this helps...

Or simply detect whether the bot has moved more than 300 units. (Jump from place 'o' death to spawn point) It works 100% (Unless bots are stuck at spawns anyway)

Thanks for your replies guys, I actually decided to approach it the much simpler way that DarkYouth suggested here, and I got it working perfectly.  ;)
