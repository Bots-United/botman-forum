You should spend time following some of the Half-Life coding tutorials (sites can be found on my MOD FAQ page).

You will need to understand Vectors and the UTIL_TraceLine() function.  You will need to understand how weapons are selected and how ammo is stored.  You will need to know how to search the world for entities and how to react to things that you find in the world.

There aren't any "tutorials" per say on creating a bot for Half-Life, but there are PLENTY of sites with tutorials or discussions on how to get bots to navigate unknown terrain.  See my Links page for many good sites (William's CGF pages on the Bot Aid site are good discussions of more complex concepts).

Start out fairly simple.  Don't try to handle every possible situation at once.  If you do, you'll never get something that you can release.  Also, good navigation without waypoints is incredibly difficult.  The Gladitor bot for Q2 (by Mr. Elusive) pulled it off using information from the map BSP file to create AAS files.  You need a VERY good understanding of how information is stored in the BSP tree to be able to make use of this kind of information.  Other than that, the simplest method of naviagation is waypoints.  Without them (or some other method or storing path markers) your bot will just wander around and probably never be able to find a goal (like a flag, hostages, health, ammo, etc.).

I'm trying to make a bot without waypoints too, altough it does look really hard. Maybe I'll come up with something - if not, I'll just try waypoints.
