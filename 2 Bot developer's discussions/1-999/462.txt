Botman, what exactly is a client bot? 
Does It control the view and action of the player?

How are they made?
Once made, can I connect it with any server?

Where can I find more information about this subject? 

Thanks

Client side bots are bots that simulate (or assist ) a player.

All existing bots for Half-Life are server side bots (the code MUST run on the same machine as the server).  Quake has may bots that are server side and many bots that are client side.

In order to create a client side bot you HAVE to understand the network protocol being sent between the server and the client.  You have to be able to intercept and interpret the network packets to know where players are located (as well as what weapons have spawned, what position elevators are at, etc.).  So far, no one has release any detailed information about the Half-Life network protocol.

I created a little proxy program called NetProbe that allows you to log the network packets being sent back and forth between a client and a server.  If you want to see what the network packets look like you can download the NetProbe application from my web site here...

You may also find it very usefull to peruse the information on the Quake Network Protocol found on the Quake Developer's Pages here...

Thanks for the explanation...

But I really don't want to work with sockets!

I'm trying to modify the CBasePlayer class to control the player (with my CBasePlayer::Think() function). But the game crashes when I use g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove() to move it.

Is it the right way to manipulate the players entity? Is it possible at all?

I tried to overwrite pev->button in the PreThink() function. So I could determine witch button is pressed at each frame and determine the player's behavior but... no success!

I've noticed that there is a great difference about this and the bots. My Think() function is called each frame so this could be the problem...

Anyway, 
I would apreciate your help.

Everything in the SDK is server side code.  You can't connect to a server on some other machine then have your machine also run server side code.  It can't be done.  The only thing you can change on the client side is the client.dll file, but you can't connect to a server with a custom client.dll if you are running a different client.dll (the server does a CRC check to make sure your client.dll and the server's client.dll match each other).
