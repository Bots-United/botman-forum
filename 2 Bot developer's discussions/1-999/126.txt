I know this isn't totlay bot related but i also know that botman can help me (i hope) & has some relation to your weapon stripper i think .

I want to have some coding in my mod that makes it so only one weapon from [Primary,Secondary,Explosive} can be picked up by a player , ive had some help from people but ive not yet got it compiled due to aload of error's , ive also tryed these ways :

1.One weapon from each slot only allow to be picked up ( my primary goal would to have a system like this)

2.Told that have weapon weight to identfy between primary and secondar so on but told this would screw up any bots if i wanted them in :(

The main problem is i can't compile some code into the player.cpp , would you know what would be best to do, and what part of the player.cpp shpould it go, ive tryed under the weapon touch but no joy.

(i want a cs type weapon system, only one weapon of each type) sorry if i shouldn't post this here but i need help any one.

You should add your code to the Touch() function for each weapon (not put it in the player.cpp code).  The Touch() function will get called when a player's bounding box collides with the bounding box of the weapon (actually the player's Touch function gets called too, if there is one).

In the weapon's Touch function you'll get the entity that did the "touching" and you can convert that to a pointer to player (pPlayer).  Search through the SDK code for examples of this.  Using the pPlayer you can determine what weapons this player is carrying.  If they are already carrying a weapon of this type, then just return from the Touch function without doing anything else.  Otherwise, execute the code that is in there now.

You'll probably want to bind a key to "drop" so that players can drop weapons that they are carrying (in order to pick up another weapon of the same class).
