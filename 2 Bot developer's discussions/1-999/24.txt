Hello Everyone,

I know this is kind of off-topic, but I was wondering if anyone knew how to pass parameters to message-mapped functions? Like if you have the BN_CLICKED message of a Button function called "OnCloseButton" how can you pass a parameter (ie "1") to the OnCloseButton function? I can have it call the function when the button is clicked, but how do I get a parameter to it? (if I want more than one message to use a function in different ways)

Does that kind of make sense?

U can just resend ya received message via SendMessage(HWND,UINT type,lParam,wParam);
(this works at least when programming directly Win32API, but you seem to use MFC ( :-( ). Prob there is something similar)
