I wonder why no-one has even tried porting it to other languages?

HL is based on C++ and languages like Basic and Delphi are highly incompatible with them. You have to include some SDK files and you also have to use the edict_t type and you can't do that with Delphi or Basic.

You can port the edict_t to a record(similar to a struct) and go on from there. 

I think i heard somewhere that delphi's record type is incompatible with C++'s struct, but i'm not sure. 
If delphi can't be ported to the HL SDK, then how the hell did they port the windows api to delphi???

There is always a way. Even when it seems impossible.
