I don't have my files here so I can't have a look. Why don't you see for yourself? There's a file with all the MOVETYPE constants: could be const.h, but I'm not sure. You can find it with the "search in files" function of MSVC: Look for MOVETYPE_FLY or any other that you are sure that it exists and check the h-files where it appears - you will find it in less than a minute that way...

I found it .
There is one.
Is it a good idea to use it for ladder heanling?
(going down)
When using it there is no chanse of falling down.

I wouldn't change the movetype of the bots unless you want them to do some weird things like flying around (as proposed some threads ago). The engine handles all the normal movement functions. When a player (or bot) is climbing a ladder it will automatically set the movetype to MOVETYPE_FLY. You can't prevent the bot from falling by just setting it to MOVETYPE_STEP. What you need is a good waypoint code :-) Have a look at the 'Ladder Handling' thread for more details...
