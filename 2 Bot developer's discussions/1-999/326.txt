Oh OK it's like this .

How do you find wich waypoints are conectet with
paths with current waypoint and how do you mark
those waypoints so you can use them in random selecting one of them ?

Is it now OK ? :o)

If you are using the code from the HPB bot template source (or earlyer HPB bot source), you can use the path linked list to find which other waypoints have a path from the current waypoint.

The WaypointFindPath() function can be used to interate through all the paths from the current waypoint.  It is up to you to decide which path to take based on the direction you want to go, where you've been before, etc.  Also take a look at this...

I'm using youre alpha3 source. I'm a newbie so
I need the code . It's short one so pls botman if you have time post it here. Here is my imagination:

t     y      u
 #    #     #
  ### # ###
      o
      #
      r

the bot is now at "o" and he is coming from "r"
the "###" are paths(created with "xxx createX")
find all waypoints conected with "o" with paths
*** those are "r","t","y"&"u" ***
skip "r" because it's previus waypoint and randomly chose one "t","y" or "u"

The code shown in my link gives you an example of interating through all the paths from the current waypoint.

You will probably want to keep an list of waypoints you have visited previously so that you don't keep going to a waypoint you just came from.  This can be done using an array.  When you want to add a new waypoint index to the array, just shuffle them all down 1 position and store the new waypoint at the start of the array.  The use the code shown above to cycle through the waypoint indexes and skip over any of them that are in your array of recently visited waypoint indexes.

If you don't know what an array is or how to implement what I am describing then you should probably spend a little more time learning C before trying to create a bot.  You should have a good understanding of arrays, structures and pointers before trying to create a bot.
