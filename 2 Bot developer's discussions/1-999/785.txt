Can anyone tell me what the exact size of a Counter-Strike player is? (Or where I can find this info?)
Thanks.

If it's the same as in HL, it's 32*32*72 units (x*y*z). You could try to verify it by checking player->edict->v.absmax and absmin, the world coordinates of the player at two opposing corners.

(I thought they changed it in cs. or was it just the view-height?)
