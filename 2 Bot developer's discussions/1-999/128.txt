My bot's sorted... sort of, and I'm working on the VIP (Thank's for your info on moving vechicles and monsters!!

1) How do I get the console background compiled into "cached.wad"? I've found the list file for compiling, but what do I do with it!!??

2) I've seen your interface, so how big in pixels,is the AVI file, and at which pixel (related to the background) is the top left hand corner placed (So I can have PART of the background in my AVI file.)

3) I've been considering adding a specific waypoint in each level that the bots will try and move to (For stuff like turrets and 'good hidy holes' and mission points), any suggestions? THIS IS HARD!!! I was thinking of getting the bot to find out the current angle form it to the 'Objective WP' and navigate while trying to keep this angle, i.e. after going around a corner, correct its current agle. Is this a good idea?

1) Read the planethalflife.com/botman/MOD_FAQ.shtmlMOD FAQ.

2) The frame size is 640x100.  You can download many shareware AVI editors to create your logo.avi file (I did).

3) Having just a single waypoint at a destination will not allow the bot to get to that location.  For example if you had a U shaped hallway and the bot starts at one end and the destination was at the other end, the bot would actually have to get further away from the destination to get there.  Waypoints need to be located close enough together so that the bot can "see" then next waypoint from the current waypoint.  Otherwise it simply doesn't know which way to go.  Trying to create a bot that doesn't use waypoints is fine if you just want them randomly wandering around, but in order to have a bot get to a goal as quickly as possible you will HAVE to have some sort of waypoint system.  These waypoints may be placed manually ahead of time or automatically by the bots or human players.  Some information can be obtained from the map dynamically (like where ammo is located or where doors are located) other information (like good sniper spots) are more difficult (or impossible) to obtain on the fly.

No one ever said making a good bot was easy.  It's amazing how many people underestimate the amount of work (and logic) is required to create good bot.  If making a good bot was easy everybody would do it.  But don't give up if things get difficult.  There are several resources on the Internet (like this forum) to get help and ask questions and many bot developers are more than willing to help up-and-coming bot authors get started.  Just don't expect them to give away ALL of their secrets. ;)
