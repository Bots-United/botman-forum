every time I compile the dll and run it, the sniper only move head up and down while charging. They seem to aim for head and body, but can't they can't decide which one. Also they rarely ever shoot (I MEAN RARELY). code is
Vector BotBodyTarget( edict_t *pBotEnemy, bot_t *pBot )
{
   Vector target;
   float f_distance;
   float f_scale;
   int d_x, d_y, d_z;

   edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;

   f_distance = (pBotEnemy->v.origin - pEdict->v.origin).Length();

   if (f_distance > 1000)
      f_scale = 1.0;
   else if (f_distance > 100)
      f_scale = f_distance / 1000.0;
   else
      f_scale = 0.1;

   // randomly select the aiming style...
   switch (RANDOM_LONG(0, 0))
   {
      case 0:
         // VERY GOOD, same as from CBasePlayer::BodyTarget (in player.h)
         target = pBotEnemy->v.origin + pBotEnemy->v.view_ofs * RANDOM_FLOAT( 0.5, 1.1 );
         d_x = 0;  // no offset
         d_y = 0;
         d_z = 0;
         break
   }

   target = target + Vector(d_x, d_y, d_z);

   return target;
}


bool BotFireWeapon( Vector v_enemy, bot_t *pBot )
{
   // Use the Vector argument of the emeny to aim at the enemy and fire
   // here.  Return TRUE if bot fired weapon (enough ammo, etc.) otherwise
   // return FALSE to indicate failure (maybe bot would runaway then).

   pBot->pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK;

   return TRUE;
}


void BotShootAtEnemy( bot_t *pBot )
{
   edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;

   // aim for the head and/or body
   Vector v_enemy = BotBodyTarget( pBot->pBotEnemy, pBot ) - GetGunPosition(pEdict);

   pEdict->v.v_angle = UTIL_VecToAngles( v_enemy );
 
   // Paulo-La-Frite - START bot aiming bug fix
   if (pEdict->v.v_angle.x > 180)
      pEdict->v.v_angle.x -=360;
   
   if (pEdict->v.v_angle.y > 180)
      pEdict->v.v_angle.y -=360;

   // set the body angles to point the gun correctly
   pEdict->v.angles.x = pEdict->v.v_angle.x / 3;
   pEdict->v.angles.y = pEdict->v.v_angle.y;
   pEdict->v.angles.z = 0;

   // adjust the view angle pitch to aim correctly (MUST be after body v.angles stuff)
   pEdict->v.v_angle.x = -pEdict->v.v_angle.x;
   // Paulo-La-Frite - END

   pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = pEdict->v.v_angle.y;

   BotFixIdealYaw(pEdict);

   // select the best weapon to use at this distance and fire...
   BotFireWeapon( v_enemy, pBot );
}

For the bot to use the sniper rifle (in TFC), it must charge the rifle by holding the fire button down, then release the fire button to fire.  Other weapons (like the shotgun or assault cannon) can be fired JUST by holding the fire button down, but for the sniper rifle you MUST charge it then release the button.

When you start "firing" at an enemy with the sniper rifle, set a timeout variable to the current time (gpGlobals->time) plus some delay, like this...

fire_delay = gpGlobals + 2.5;  // fire in 2.5 seconds

...then keep holding the fire button down by setting v.button = IN_ATTACK.  After the desired time delay has been reached, release the button.  You could do something like this...

if (fire_delay > gpGlobals->time)
   pBot->pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK;  // keep fire button pressed down
else
   pBot->pEdict->v.button = 0;  // release fire button

...Note that you MUST keep the fire button pressed down EVERY frame or the MOD DLL code will think that you've released the button.
