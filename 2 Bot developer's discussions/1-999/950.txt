Now im pissed.
I can get a bot into the game and it just sits in the observer mode (bugga).As soon as I try and add a second bot it f**ks up and kicks me to the desktop (double bugga) And there are no weapons.
As soon as I ad the weapons and other entities to the linkfunc.cpp I can get it working but Now I cant add a single bot and it will crash (quadrupile triple choc bugga) please help.......

I've never played wastelend or whatever, but try putting this in the place where the bots are meant to press attack...

if(RANDOM_LONG(0,100)<30)
{
   pBot->pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK;
}

The problem may also be caused by the new HPB bot template, but I've not looked at the new template much, so I can't help u with that at the moment - have u added in all that stuff about weapon delays and things at the top of bot_combat.cpp? I think that the template 2 bots need all that stuff for EVERY weapon, or they won't fire

if all that is true, you might just want to use the old template, which was much simple... but i'm not sure if botman still has it available for download.  With template one the bots attacked automatically in the mods it already supported.  You might also want to try checking stuff out in combat.cpp where there is some mod specific stuff, and just look to see how it looks for enemies, because once it has an enemy, it should shoot at it, at least with template 1.  Another question, do the bots react to enemies and go after them and just not fire, or do they totally ignore them?  If they ignore them, it means they aren't seeing them as enemies, and using pBot->v.button = IN_ATTACK won't matter
