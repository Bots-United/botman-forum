How can I hook radio text?

i.e. Storm the front.

I have no idea how to set about coding this and the message hooking system is very complicated in the alpha 3 source.


Ive got a lot of the work done so far but the last step eludes me.

You can do it one of two ways.

1. Hook into the client messages and look for this particular radio message.

OR

2. Just use strcmp() on all messages sent in WriteString() and assume that if you see that text then it's a radio message.  Of course it could just be someone sending that text in a say command instead.

Isnt there some padding in the string too?


How would I do that AND make sure the right edict_t is given the message

i.e. the message may not be for this bot...

The problems I see are:

identifying the bot entity it is for

removing the padding or just looking if part of the string contains "Fall Back"..

Im not familiar with basic string manipulating in C++ (I only learnt from HPB source)

I got a second hand copy of visual studio cheap since the owner broke his documentation disk. And the dummies guide to c++ doesnt quite cut it.

I ended up burning the god forsaken book three weeks ago during a serious bot crashing bug problem.

You can identify who the message is coming from by watching the ClientCommand() function.  It will contain the edict of the sender of the "radio" command.  Since several radio messages could come from several different sources, you'll probably have to keep an array of clients that have sent messages.

You can't tell who the message is directed to unless the name of the player that your sending the message to is contained within the message.  You can use the strstr() function to see if a substring is contained within a string like this...

if (strstr(message, "Bob"))
{
   // "Bob" appears somewhere in the message
}
