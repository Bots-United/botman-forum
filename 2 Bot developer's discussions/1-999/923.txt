I have a problem with my bot. It turns very fast. I turns 180 degrees in 1 frame. I don't know what's cousing this. Does any one had this before.

in the original hpb1 source it's
code:

// turn towards ideal_yaw by yaw_speed degrees
yaw_degrees = BotChangeYaw( pBot, pEdict->v.yaw_speed );
, so u've only to set pEdict->v.yaw_speed to another variable (->frameratedependent)
