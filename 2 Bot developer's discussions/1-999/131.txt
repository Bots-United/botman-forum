Im working on expanding my bot to play TFC.

The entity you should locate is the:

building_sentry_base

and the dispenser is:

building_dispenser

I cant figure out how to determine which team a turret is tho...

Have you tried checking the "team" field in the entvars_t structure?

It might just be the "owner" field linking to who ever built the sentry gun (which is the most likely thing since that's who gets credit for the kills).

i located the entities...found them in the linkfunc.cpp file!

LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(building_dispenser, "building_dispenser");
LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(building_sentrygun, "building_sentrygun");
LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(building_sentrygun_base, "building_sentrygun_base");


Ack! I was wondering...how can i make the bot build an sg if it is an engineer

i dont want a straight-forward answer, if possible. i wanna learn how to do this

Turn on the "debug_engine" flag and watch what gets sent to the MOD when you build a sentry gun.  Look for ClientCommand() calls in the bot.txt output.

Look at how a human player builds a sentry gun.  They use the menu.  You need the bots to send the same thing to the MOD DLL that a human player would when using the menu.

Turn on the "debug_engine" flag (by pulling down the console and typing "debug_engine" without the quotes then return to the game).  When you select an item from a menu the client.dll will send a command to the server MOD DLL.  This command is passed to the server MOD DLL using the ClientCommand() function.

When you turn on the debug_engine flag, lots of debug stuff will get written to a file in the Half-Life directory called "bot.txt".  Look through this text file for places where ClientCommand occurs and see that command were sent when menu items were selected. (i.e. they will be "menuselect X" where X is a number).  You can then use the FakeClientCommand() to get the bots to send a ClientCommand() just as if it had come from a real client.
