Right, I've got a bot proggy working.. :) I've changed Half-Lifes's interface, but the one problem haunting me is how to insert a "monseter" designed to run with the mod + bot. The "monster" which will be a "V.I.P", cannont hog up client index's (so max clients cannot be reached).

1) Will the fact that the game is in "deathmatch" mode not "co-op" affect this?
2) How do I insert the V.I.P into the game?
3) How do I put the V.I.P into the dll file (so not to affect any bots)?
4) Were can I find code for moving vechicles!!?

;)

You should probably start with the Full SDK since you want to include NPC's into the MOD.  The Full SDK can only be built with Microsoft Visual C++, so if you're using MingW32 you'll have problems.

You'll need to create a map with a monster spawn point (see mapping sites like planethalflife.com/wavelength for details on this).

You'll need to create code for the VIP if you want to alter the behavior from the default scientist/barney AI scripting.

Vechicles are a modified func_train that doesn't require a track.  Start by copying the func_train code and modify it to allow the player to control the direction (instead of having it follow tracks).
