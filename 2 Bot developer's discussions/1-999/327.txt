How do I get the bots to chat a string?

char *txt;
sprintf(txt, "I can't believe it", NULL);
FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "say", txt, NULL);

It produces:

Bot   : say I can't believe it

How do you do the chat thing?

I'm not botman...but

Hint 1:
Look how ClientPrint is done in Util.cpp

Hint 2:
Take a closer look in your debug_log or bot.txt at
the Message "SayText".

Still confused ? Well, in short - you have to write your own substitution for Util_SayText since FakeClientCommand puts the command before it and if you try Server_Command instead, the Bot chats with your name. Deal with it, write your own SayText !

Use this: UTIL_SayText( const char *pText, edict_t *pEdict ) 
So something like.

char msg[] = "I can't believe I did this!";
UTIL_SayText(msg, pEdict);

That'll work.
