I have this BotChat.txt loaded and allocated in GameDLLInit at startup (damn Botman you're too fast ! I wanted to be the first to have chatting Bots...). But I didn't notice a Function which gets called when a Mod is shutdown. Maybe I could free it all if the last Client gets disconnected but it doesn't sound safe to me. Botman: could you let me know at what point do you free your bot_whine.txt ?

I've just got a static array of 80 character strings like so...

char bot_whine[MAX_BOT_WHINE][81];

...then I fill it in and keep track of how many are being used.  If you want to dynamically allocate and free memory you can do so in the DllMain() function (in h_export.cpp).  It gets called when Half-Life loads the DLL and will get called by Windows when the executable exits.
