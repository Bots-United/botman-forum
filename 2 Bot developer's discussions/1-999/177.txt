Hi 

I believe its on bot_combat.cpp the BotFireWeapon function. That seems so cycle trough all weapons, and check if their usage conditions are met.

I've remove the HPB bot Alpha 3 source code and replaced it with a simpler HPB bot template version.

There is a function in util.cpp called UTIL_SelectItem() where you can send a string with the weapon name you want to select.  You pass in the edict and the item name you want to switch to like this...

UTIL_SelectItem(pBot->pEdict, "weapon_rpg");
