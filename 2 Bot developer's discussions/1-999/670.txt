I don't know why but, since I use the template source of botman's bot, only one bot choose a team and the others are unassigned : it is very strange because it is the first time I have this problem...

Need assistance plz

I assume you mean with Counter-Strike.

Are you intercepting the menus where the bot picks the team and model correctly (using pfnMessageBegin, pfnWriteByte, pfnWriteString, etc.)?  The HPB bot template code should do this properly so as long as you don't change anything you should be okay.  Try building the unmodified HPB bot template code and use that to see if the problem goes away or not.  Perhaps your CS or Half-Life installation is screwed and needs to be re-installed.  That's the solution to everything, if it doesn't work, re-install it.  :)

I tried what you said Botman, but I can't find why that don't work now...
When I make a debug session using debug_engine = 1, I found that something is wrong with the function BotStartGame() or something like that :(

With your template version, that works but not with mine... Hope you can find a solution to solve this problem, because play with only one bot sucks a lot.

Thanks for your help botman

Are you saying that you build the un-modified HPB bot template source code and only 1 bot will join a team?  If this is the case, you either have a problem with the bot code or a problem with Half-Life.  Download the HPB bot template source code again and build it (unmodified), copy the .dll file to the desired MOD directory and try adding bots.  If that works then you've screwed something up in your code (which I probably can't help with).  If that still doesn't work the only suggestion I have is to uninstall, reinstall and update Half-Life to version 1.1.0.4.

When uninstalling Half-Life make SURE to remove the Half-Life directory so that you KNOW that you have removed every single file in there.

I modified the source code. I followed your instructions, got a new source code and leave it unmodified. The result is that the bots CAN join the game. Well, seems like i screwed something(as always). What about u Paulo?
