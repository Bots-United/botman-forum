Use the DispatchKeyValue() function to intercept key/value pairs for entities as they are being created by TFC.  Download the TFC FGD file to find out which names represent which items then just convert the ASCII values to integers (by using atoi).

For example, "info_tfdetect" contains a field called "ammo_medikit".  This field is used to specify the maximum number of players on the blue team (like maps that have a limit of 1 civilian on a team, i.e. HUNTED).
