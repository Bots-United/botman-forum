Botman,
First, huge thanks for your e-mail with the files.
I am a total newbie, and I will probably spend the next few days to learn the BOT's code, but why don't you help us, the newbies, and make a little shortcut - give a few examples of how to do things, tell what each cpp file does etc.
Or you can just ask from someone else to do that...
Thanks!

My intent is not to teach everyone how to create a bot for Half-Life or Half-Life MODS.

If you don't already know C++, you should start by learning to program in C++.  Buy a good book on learning C++, buy or download a C++ compiler, and follow the examples in the book.  Become familiar with structures, pointers, inheritance, bit manipulation functions, looping constructs and all of the other C++ constructs.

Next, download the Half-Life SDK from Valve's web site (you can find the link on my "Building the SDK" page).  Look through the SDK to see how things fit together.  See what classes are inheriting from other classes.  Learn how the server and client communicate with each other through network messages.

Visit many of the Half-Life coding sites and try out some of the tutorials to become familar with modifying things in the SDK.  Create your own MOD where you have changed weapons or ammo, or added features to the game.

The download one of my Half-Life deathmatch bots (like Bot Number 10) and look through the code there to see how bots (derived from the player class) are able to move around in the level.  Look at how they fire the weapons.  Look at how they track how much ammo is available.  Look at how they deal with water or ladders or elevators.

Once you understand all of the above, then download the HPB bot source and modify it to do what you want for a MOD.

It's NOT easy!  If it was everybody would be doing it.

Yes, I understand your point.
I agree you shouldn't tell everyone how to make a great bot with great navigation and really smart.
All I say is, that if answer people questions in this forum about bots, and most of them are basic, you can collect some really basic questions and answer them.

BTW - I don't think I need tutorials now, I think I understand quite a bit about bots creating and I'm starting to create one very soon.

I didn't say I wouldn't help someone with their bot coding.  What I said was it was not my intent to hold every newbie bot developer's hand while they attempt to create a "sUp3R 733t hax0r boT".  You'd be amazed at how much e-mail I get from people that don't know C code from a hole in the wall.  They have this GREAT navigation idea that doesn't require any waypoints and will handle ALL maps perfectly ("just like the BEST human players").  The only thing is they don't know how to code and they want me to explain to them how to code in 500 words or less.

I don't mind helping somebody out, but if you ask how to do something (like use the weapons, store information about players, or implement some navigation algorithm), I expect you to have enough coding knowledge to be able to take a text description of a solution and create the code for it yourself.

My solutions to a problem aren't always going to be the best solution.  Many things that I have implemented in the bot code are done in the worst possible way.  If I had the time and energy I would rip out all of the existing bot code and start everything over.  I still may do that one day, but I wanted to get the HPB bot to a point where I was moderately happy with the ability before doing so, because once I start, there won't be anything released for at least 6 months.
