O.K.

I've build my graph of distances from node to node.

Now how do I create a path using this. In simple C++ if possible. Since Dijkstra's algorithm or floyds nightmare just are incomprehensible to me.

i.e.    pBot---->wpt1----->wpt8---->wpt4--->pEnemy

I can pre-define a list and then make the bot go from point 1 to 12 if I manually enter the data.

I determine the final point in the list by just picking the one nearest the destination (be it man or beast :))

The trouble is I know this can be done with looped ifs or a while(x) statement

But hoooow!!

Ive defined the matrix as 
float matrix[max teams][maxwpts][maxwpts] 

Each value stores the distance.


William????? Botman??

<hole in space/time opens>   Argghhhh im being sucked in and Dijkstra's algorithm is eating me

<Dijkstra's algorithm> muhahahhhahahhhahhah, Only the guys at botmans forums can help you now....

<me> Really?

<Dijkstra's algorithm> Well, no, not really. You could sign up at a university.

<me> Arrghhhhhhhhhhh. No, not university.

I do look.

But then my brain starts to seep out of the side of my head.......

ARGGHH

Thats a good piece of code there.

Im working on putting it in my bot now.

Im also still working on swat vs android.
But when I add a bot it crashes the game.
This may be because both mods think the fl_fakeclient flag means they have to work.
Could I change my fl_ type to something else so I use fl_something as a bot flag, but android keeps fl_fakeclient.

Try this...

...and this...

These were both found using Google to search for "floyd algorithm", then reading what was found at EVERY link.  Don't be too lazy when trying to find out information.  :)

Okay, apparently I modified my post at the same time you replied, so things got out of sequence.

That's a bug in YaBB.  Another bug is that if someone modifies a post it will ALWAYS show up as "New" in the list of posts even after you read it.  The YaBB guys haven't figured out how to fix this problem.

Can you re-post that code.

I got a few lines in but the rest was gone when I came back.

Goddamn it YaBB need a patch.

The code I had originally posted kept getting mangled by YaBB.  The '[' and ']' characters especially made it wig out.

The code was the source from the first URL above combined with the matrix presented in the second URL above.  I had modified it to use -1 for an infinite distance (INF).

Just use the code from the first URL, since that does what you want.
