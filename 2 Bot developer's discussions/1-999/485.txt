Thanks everyone for patronizing. I never thought it would take 6 months to create a good bot, but since I'm working on it for about two weeks, and the bot cann't even wonder around safely, I might belive it.

But I do not want to write a navigation code that simply allows a BOT to wander and shoot when he sees an enemy. I'm planning the following approach:

- BOTS always do things because of a REASON.
- BOTS have a MOTIVE, which motivates them to REACH GOLAS.
- GOALS have priority which can change over time.

Beasically, I want to keep these motives at a minimum, to force bot to create 'new' rules based on the few base rules.

BOT MOVEMENT EXAMPLE:

1. BOT LOOKS AROUND
2. BOT FIND INTERESING PLACES (N,W,S,E)
3. BOT WISITS INTERESING PLACE (N)
4. BOT FINDS A LOT MORE INTERESTING PLACES
5. BOT JUMPS IF NECCESSARY
6. BOT DUCKS IF NECCESSARY
7. BOT SEES AN ENEMY
8. BOT DIES
9. BOT REMEMBERS THE PLACE OF THE DEATH AND WHERE THE ENEMY WERE SEEN.
10. NEXT TIME WHEN BOT REACHES PLACE, LOOKS TOWARDS ENEMY POSITION IN CASE HE WILL BE THERE.
11. BOT KEEPS RAECHING INTERESTING PLACES TILL ALL ARE VISITED.
12. after that new motives are needed... I have no idea....

Sounds simple, and promising. I would like to hear your opinion, since many of you might want to do the same thing. At the beginging I think it is very difficult to pull out a solution to the problem, but after a while it must get easyer.

sounds like it would take alot of time and coding but very promising. Thats something I have been looking in to but im to lazy to do it. hehe
