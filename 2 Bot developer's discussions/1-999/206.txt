Every time I compile the .dll and test it, the bots don't follow the waypoints. Help me out. Thanks

Which HPB bot source code are you building?

If you downloaded the HPB bot template version (called HPB_bot_src.zip) then you are correct, they don't follow waypoints.  Look at the source code.  The bot navigation functions are empty (they don't do anything).  You will need to fill in these functions with whatever code you want to use to get the bot to navigate.  The waypoint code was left in there to show you how waypoints can be stored for a map.  Using them properly is up to you.

There is source code in the alpha version you can can use as a starting point.

How come you left out the navigation code Botman ?

Was it because of that guy that ripped you off ?

I kept receiving lots of e-mail from people that didn't like (or understand) the waypoint navigation code I had.  They tried removing it and were no longer able to get the code to compile (or it would compile but the bot wouldn't move) and they wanted to know what was wrong.  Two or three people e-mailed me the source code they had changed and wanted me to "fix it" and then mail it back to them.

I figured it would be easier just to have a simple version that didn't do anything at all and let other people add their own stuff.  If they don't understand their own code then it's not my problem.

Can you release the HPB - Advanced Source Code for people who like waypoints and dont want a CPU intensive non waypoint bot that doesnt do much except hump the walls on cs_italy bot.

Ok thanks, I was just wondering. It probably would make it easier however to have the waypoint code in.

I'd rather not because then I'd be back in the same situation I was before.

If you want to use Floyd's algorithm for waypoint navigation, here's the link that I took most of the source code from (it's REAL simple)...

I just keep a separate Floyd matrix for each team so that they quickly know which is the next node when heading towards a specific goal.

See it from botmans point of view he don't want to be making 10 diffrent HPB bots for people(wich is what was happening). Plus as he said it proved to be a hiderance to wouldbe bot coders because they did not understand the code. Sure it might be harder to do it your self but its more rewarding in the end(and means botman has more time to work on the HPB bot:)).

Keep up the GOOD work botman

What about if you released it by Email?
Or put it on an ftp and people request password from you. Then no 10 year olds download, compile and cry cos their bots dont buy guns.

By the way....

If anyone is willing to put up a site somewhere
(ASK NUCLEARBOX) I'd be willing to post tutorials on the following.
---------Planting the Bomb
---------Buying Weapons
---------Radio Useage
---------Bot Chatting (I think Ive done it. :))
---------Bot Names
---------Sniping and how to implement
---------Improved weapon selection

and about a dozen others.....

Botman,
Im trying to get them to chat by directly using the MESSAGEBegin, byte, end functions. Remember, the ones that had to be hooked.

It works so far with small messages.

DarkYouth,

I'll put whatever you want pertaining to that on Nuclearbox. Just email me whatever you want to put up, and I'll format it to HTML and everything for ya.
