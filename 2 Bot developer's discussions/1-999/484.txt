I've tried several things but never can get it.
I'm able to get the Menu Showing.
But when I press 1 or 2 or any choice it doesn't work :(  What am I doing wrong?

code:

UTIL_ShowMenu(pEntity, 3, -1, FALSE, "1. Waypoints ON\n2. Waypoints OFF\n");

if (FStrEq(pcmd, "menuselect"))
{
 if (FStrEq(arg1, "1"))
 {
  g_waypoint_on = TRUE;
  return;
 }
 else if (FStrEq(arg1, "2"))
 {
  g_waypoint_on = FALSE;
  return;
 }
}



????

I'm only beginig to understand how half-life works, but I would guess, that after this magical MENUSELECT command (which I never herad of) the 'answer' would arrive assyncronously. Menaing, that you have to trace some kind of a message. I guess. 

Just try, if the menu function returns immediately or not. It it does return in an instance (GetTickCount() value doesn't changes), it must be an assync func.

Hope, hope...

You need to put an entry in the ClientCommand function to check for something like "waymenu" which just shows the menu (UTIL_ShowMenu).
Then add another seperate entry for "menuselect"
which is the lower portion of code.
These 2 bits have to be seperate as they are 2 seperate commands.
The client will send "waymenu" first and you show the menu.
Then the client will send a "menuselect","1" command.
Hope this helps
