Hi,

I'm writing a bot based on HPbot.  Can someone verify for me if this bug exists?

When I start a Valve multiplayer LAN game with team play on, the bots don't shoot at me or each other.

Thanks,
sygnet

Yes, the bots will not shoot at any player that is on the same team as them.  You could change it so that they did occasionally shoot team members if you wanted to.  This isn't a bug.

If you mean that they don't shoot at an player (including the other team) then you have either changed the code so that they don't detect enemies correctly anymore or you have a problem with your Half-Life installation.  If you haven't changed the code then you should try uninstalling Half-Life, reinstall it and patch it up to the latest version.

After looking into this a little more closely I understand what you are talking about now.

Yes, if you play Half-Life deathmatch in teamplay mode with the HPB bots, they don't know which players are on which team.  I'm using the edict->v.team field to determine which team they are on, but the Half-Life SDK uses m_szTeamName in CBasePlayer to determine the team.

If you are creating your own bot from the HPB bot source code and want to support teamplay, you can look at the value of the CVAR "mp_teamlist" and compare those names to the player's models like I do for Counter-Strike in UTIL_GetTeam().

Thanks for pointing this bug out to me.  I'll fix this in the next release of the HPB bot so it will be able to support teamplay in deathmatch.  I never play using teamplay so I would have never found this problem myself.
