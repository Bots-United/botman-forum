First, thanks to those who helped me answer a few questions in the past.  I really appreciate it.  I turned in my final project for my Genetic Programming class which was a half-life mod with bots that learned and it was a whopping success.  Thanks again.

Now, on to the questions.

1.  My mod still has a couple issues.  After it runs for a while (maybe a couple hours) and I've gone through 100+ bots (Max 31 running at the same time), I noticed that eventhough there are only 8 bots currently running around and the scoreboard shows 8 bots in game, if I loop the the Players using the UTIL_Player_by_Index (or whatever that function is) I get Players for all 32 slots (31 which are Fake Clients).  As far as I know that shouldn't happen.  Also, If I look at the ID numbers of those 31 bots, most of them were bots that have had SERVER_CMD("kick") executed on them.  Any idea why I'd still have these phantom connections?

2.  Has anyone ever looked into making a client that connects to a server as a bot?  If so, anyone know where I might find an example of this?  I'm thinking it's probably more stable to have a Server running only 1 bot at a time rather than 31 bots at the same time and then have the rest of the bots connect as clients from other PCs.

Thanks again.

1. Are you sure they are players connected to the server or are you just seeing non-null player slots?  The engine will keep the edict and pvPrivate data portion of a player when they leave a server or get kicked from it.  So if you were expecting the pEdict to be null or the pEdict->free field to be set to TRUE, they won't be.  You can check if the pEdict->v.netname field is null.  I've seen this used to determine if a player slot has an edict and pvPrivateData section but isn't currently being used by a player (or bot).

2. There have been attempts to create a client side bot.  Use www.google.com to search for "half-life client bot" and you'll find the website (which is currently just about creating client side cheats).
