People that use my Remote-X remote server control app wish to use bots with it, does BotMaster allow any DLL to combine with others, or it is coded to support bots only?

I think you should be able to use any Add-On type DLL with it.  The only bot specific part is where it twiddles with the FL_FAKECLIENT flags to contol which bot Add-On see players as fake (bots) or not fake (players).

Also because of the fake DLL stuff, if the Add-On is making any direct calls to the MOD DLL functions (like calling ClientConnect, ClientDisconnect, DispatchSpawn, etc.) you will have to "reroute" those functions from the fake DLL code back to the master DLL code in a similar manner as how I did the ClientCommand() stuff used by the bot's FakeClientCommand().

I'll probably make a fairly detailed ReadMe.txt file that goes along with the BotMaster5000 stuff in the next release of it.  It'll take me a few weeks to kludge together some stuff, but the code isn't too hard to follow once you get your head wrapped around the relationship between the fake DLL code and the master DLL code (and how the bot DLLs get hooked to each other in between them).

I just testet ur new program and it's really great ! ( except joebot isn't in the list, but it's running, too )

Some minutes ago I wanted to find something out using debug_engine and there I found this text in my logfile :

code:
pfnMessageBegin: edict=18c1374 dest=1 type=111
pfnWriteString: #32770
pfnWriteString: Death-Adder's AimBot
pfnMessageEnd:
pfnMessageBegin: edict=18c1374 dest=1 type=111
pfnWriteString: TForm1
pfnWriteString: AutoShoot:  http://www.hlcheaters.com
pfnMessageEnd:


What's that supposed to mean ? I looked in ur code and there seems to be no such text, just in ur dll .... so what's that ?

That's crap that gets sent by the Counter-Strike server DLL to the client DLL.  I believe it was added in Beta 7.0 (or Beta 7.1).  I guess it's supposed to check for a process named "Death-Adder's Aimbot" and kill it on the client.

Yeah botman is right, I remember debug_engine in cs when i put it on by accident, It goes through that Cheat proxy stuff each round and checks the title's of all open applications like aimbot's title was "Death Adder's Aimbot".

and say something like " *** aimbotter was caught uusing a cheat proxy *** " and kills it also.

But thats hardly protection against such things is it, seems to me the CS team didn't put much effort in there.

Heres an idea - send that netmessagw with different params and try to close other processes on the client machine :) Evil I know but interesting to try.
