When generating automatic waypoints, the program should initially floodfill the map, then it should remove all waypoints the cant be reached [removing waypoints not on the ground is acceptable but it would prevent things like ladders from working because the upper waypoint on a ladder wouldnt be on the ground]. Next, while a server being played on, the waypoints files should be updated with places players go, but only when that point couldn't be reached using the waypoints already existing. Also, if a player is doing very good, the 'priority' of the waypoints he often uses should be increased, because if a player is doing good he most likely isnt sitting in a bad spot. But, only increment the waypoints that player 'uses' by a small amount. If you ran the bots on a popular server, you could end up with a very good waypoint file full of good spots for sniping [maybe assign each waypoint a status, like "sniping" or just "pathway" or "surprise" or something depending on how long the player sits there, how many kills he gets in that time, and when he moves on (after kill, after time, or immediately)] and then you could have a really awesome waypoint file for use with bots.

I've been trying to think of a way to eliminate redundant waypoints after floodfilling and removing imposible-to-reach ones, but I can't think of any way that could be done in any reasonable amount of time. Any ideas?

impossible-to-reach can be done. You just have to implement some kind of pathfinder and check for every waypoint if it's reachable from a spawn point.


removing "redundant" waypoints is difficult. I've been trying several approaches to get something like that done, but failed.

The problem is: How do you define a "good" waypoint? If you cannot define something like that in human words, you cannot code it either.


However, I'm currently working on an autowaypointer that doesn't flood fill the map, but analyzes it's geometry to place waypoints only where they're needed. But that is not easy and will take some more time.

Well, if you made a server-mod like the bot, but one that didnt actually run bots, you could make it monitor player's movements and use those to define 'good' waypoints. A player that is on top is probably using 'good' waypoints, unless its a server that allows cheating. You could make the mod merely 'watch' all the players movements on every map and make it have a dynamically updated waypoint file. After a few hours of play on a single map [a few times around the map cycle], you should have enough information for the bot to play at least acceptably.
