I would like to add a flying feature to the HPB DLL as a test, but to be awkward I do not want noclip. Im guessing you have to trick the game into thinking you are underwater.. but I have been unsucsessful.

any ideas?

If you wanted to effect all players you can set sv_gravity to something like 0.01 or if you only want to effect one player at a time you can take a look at a jetpack tutorial.

Do you have a URL to this? I looked around and found others talking about it but no actual tutorial.

Here's one.  I haven't tried it so I don't know how well it works...
