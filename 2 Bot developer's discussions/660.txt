Here's a little utility I wrote to dump the exported symbols in a DLL file...

http://planethalflife.com/botman/exports.c

Just use "cl exports.c" to compile with MSVC or "gcc -o exports.exe exports.c" to compile with MingW32.

The "-e" option will give you extended information (function ordinal number and function address).
