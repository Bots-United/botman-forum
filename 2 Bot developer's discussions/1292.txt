cl_exports again I was woundering if there was a beter way to copy text out of an ms dos file if there was like a command line you could put behind your other ones to enable you to copy text printed by a program into a file or your clipboard :)

do you mean from exports.exe program? if so type this into the dos prompt:

exports hl.dll >> exports.txt

This creates a text file for everything that it would print onto the screen
