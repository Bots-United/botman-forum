Hey botman.
I realy need help on this.
My BotFindWaypoint code looks like this:

bool BotFindWaypoint( bot_t *pBot, int team ) 
{   
   int  i, wpt_index[6], select_index;
   PATH *pPath = NULL;
   int path_index;

  for (i=0; i < 6; i++)
  {
     wpt_index[i] = -1;
  }
  for (i=0; i < num_waypoints[team]; i++)
  { 
    if ((i == pBot->curr_wpt_index) 
     (i == pBot->prev_wpt_index[0]) 
     (i == pBot->prev_wpt_index[1]) 
     (i == pBot->prev_wpt_index[2]))
     continue;

    if (i == -1)
    {
    continue;
    }
    else
    {
     i = WaypointFindPath(&pPath, &path_index, pBot->curr_wpt_index, team);
    }
  }
  select_index = (RANDOM_LONG(1, i));

  if (select_index != -1)  // was a waypoint selected?
  {
      pBot->prev_wpt_index[2] = pBot->prev_wpt_index[1];
      pBot->prev_wpt_index[1] = pBot->prev_wpt_index[0];
      pBot->prev_wpt_index[0] = pBot->curr_wpt_index;

      pBot->curr_wpt_index = select_index;
      pBot->wpt_origin = waypoints[team][select_index].origin;

      return TRUE;
  }
  else
  {
  return FALSE;
  }
}      

2 questions:
1. wen i compile it it shows me 3 errors(I'm using alpha3 source)

- *\bot.cpp(1191) : error C2065: 'WaypointFindPath' : undeclared identifier

line(1191):i = WaypointFindPath(&pPath, &path_index, pBot->curr_wpt_index, team);

- *\bot.cpp(1282) : error C2660: 'BotFindWaypoint' : function does not take 1 parameters

line(1282 & 1283): while (((status = BotFindWaypoint( pBot )) == FALSE) && (index > 0))

- *\bot.cpp(1283) : fatal error C1903: unable to recover from previous error(s); stopping compilation

How to fix that ?

2.Will the code work and if not what to change?
Here is what I want to do:

Don't take this personally, but this is one of the reasons that I no longer release all of my source code.  I get too many questions from people that don't take the time to learn how to program in C, sending me their source code asking me to fix it.

"undeclared identifier" means you are using something that you haven't declared yet.  Perhaps you left out a header (.h) file.

"BotFindWaypoint: does not take 1 parameters" means that the BotFindWaypoint() function does not take 1 parameter (it takes 2).  You are not passing in the "team" parameter when you call BotFindWaypoint.

I strongly recommend that you get a good book on learning C and/or C++ and read it.  Follow the examples in the book and learn how to identify and correct errors in your code.  You might also want to become more familiar with the help available in Microsoft Visual C++.  The help section on error messages does a fairly good job explaining what certain types of error messages mean.

Yeah,

i can truly understand you, Botman. For all truly newbies for programming with C or C++, some people say that learn C first then learn C++ its easier that way, so go do it. Get a free compiler DJGGP(32 bit) and some libs to it and program until you dream of variables, arrays and coding..
Basic -> Assembler -> Perl -> C -> C++ thats how it goes.. but i left out Pascal because i didnt bother to learn it then.. All these can be learned if you´re determined to learn & read & code and try on your own.
