Hey, i wonder if it would be possible to add a feature so the bot will automaticly check if there is an internet connection, and if so it would be able to search for a corresponding waypoint file on a specific location on the internet? Is there any way to do this? I am arranging some space and maybe someone could finally have a server for all bots on the entire planet so you could refer your bot to that server for all waypoints you ever need. If this could be in, no need to search for yourself but simply add a server, run a map and it will find waypoint files for you.

in general my questions:
- is it possible at all?
- if so, how to get the file from the internet on the specific location (how to know where to store it for example, etc).

anyone thought/tried this already?

Sure it's possible, but I wouldn't want to "clutter" the bot code with something that probably should be a standalone utility.  The problem with using a website to download is that websites always seem to come and go on the internet (and when the website changes, the download protocol would also probably change).

It seems like a better idea to me to create a utility that scans the maps in your "maps" folder and tries to download waypoints files for each of those maps.  This would allow the utility to be easily modified when the websites change locations or download protocols.

People have asked for features like this to be included in the Half-Life engine to download maps from a website instead of using the Half-Life network protocol to download resources (since it's pretty slow).  So far Valve hasn't done this (probably due to the complexity of configuring what sites and protocols to use to download map files).

pitty, but it is still a cool idea i think. Well ofcourse you should be 100% sure that the location you want to search for will be there forever but that probably wont be the case.

I actually wondered, even if the 'server' problem is not there, would it be easy to code?

It would probably be easier to have an external utility or a Web Search Engine do this. For example here's a search engine for POD-Bot Waypoints:
http://www.websrusmalls.com/~spikeles/searchform.html

However if you still want to include it in the Bot the steps would be (after uploading your wpts to some webspace):
- Open a HTTP Socket in your Bot
- connect to your server and 'get' the file using the socket

Easy as that...

Oh and you would need to checksum the maps in some way to download the correct wpts for each different map (as you know there are 1001 variations in some maps).

#1... What a hell that idea Rox.... It is really cool... Maybe bad for me that mostly play on Lan without Internet but i LovE it...

It isen't as cool botman if u have a extern tool.. It coulden't be so hard. HL Server has a look alike utility in a Dictated server where it downloads a Security Pack (anti hack thing) from the internet... U should also add a turn on/off commando in your settings.cfg or something...

I am GOING to start work on that idea and of course realese a open-source....
