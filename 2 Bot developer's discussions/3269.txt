I need to know when a new round in counterstrike has started so that I can reset some of my bots variables. I noticed Botman has code to detect a new Front Line Force round but there appears to be no such hooks for Counter Strike. Any ideas how I can detect when a round has restarted? Suggestions can either be elegant engine message catching solutions or plain ol hacks.

Thanks

I used to use a real simple trick, and detect if any bot has moved more than 500 units in a frame, if so, then it's a new round.

A better method is to check the data the server is sending for the new round signals, I haven't looked at this part of the code for donkey's years but a rough guide to engine messages can be found in the HPB template readme I believe.

A problem about checking the bot speed, the bot could have touched a trigger_push or jammed by a door that moves more than 500 units per second hehe.

The method I use is the catch the text messages like "#Round_draw" "#Terrorist_win" etc. When that happens you know a new round will start in 5 seconds.

eLiTe had an even better idea. When the "info_map_parameters" entity is triggered, the round is being restarted.

Hook it in FindEntityByString() in engine.cpp.
