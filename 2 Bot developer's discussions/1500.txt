Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?  I am trying to get the secondary and primary reload to work at the same time.  If I havet the secondary reload on top then it will only reload that ammo, and if I have the primary on top it will only reload that.  Does it have something to do with HL not allowing 2 buttons to be pressed at the exact same time or am I doing this compeltly wrong?  Thanaks for any help and here is the code:

code:

   if ((pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time > 0) &&
       ((pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time + 5.0) <= gpGlobals->time))
         if (pBot->f_primary_reloading <= gpGlobals->time)
             {
                   {

                  if (mod_id == HLPB_DLL)
                  {

                        pEdict->v.button |= IN_RELOAD;  // press co2 reload?
                        pBot->f_reload_time = gpGlobals->time + 4.0;  // keep charging
                        }
               }

   

   return (pNewEnemy);
}
   
   // is it time to reload?
   if ((pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time > 0) &&
       ((pBot->f_bot_see_enemy_time + 5.0) <= gpGlobals->time))
         if (pBot->f_primary_reloading <= gpGlobals->time)
             {
                   

                  if (mod_id == HLPB_DLL)
                  {
                        pEdict->v.button |= IN_RELOAD2;  // press co2 reload?
                        pBot->f_reload_time = gpGlobals->time;  // keep charging
                  }

         }


             return (pNewEnemy);
}

Why do both if statements check "pBot->f_primary_reloading <= gpGlobals->time".  Shouldn't the second one be f_secondary_reloading?

Thanks botman, I am sure figured it was something small like that.  Ill give it a try when I get home.

Well I went home and tried that but it didnt work.  I found a better way around it (for a temp fix), I made it so they randomly reload both types of ammo.  This works and the bots now shot.  

I have a question now, the bots only shot at point blank range.  Is this part of the template code or is it something I have done.  Thought I would ask before I started looking for the problem.
