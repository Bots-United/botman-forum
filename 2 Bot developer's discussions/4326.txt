Hello everyone,

I have made a KillAllClients() function which i call like so:

code:

if (FStrEq(pcmd, "endround"))
{
    KillAllClients();
}



This code kills all clients like so:

code:

edict_t *pPlayer;

      for (int i = 0; i <= gpGlobals->maxClients; i++)
      {
            pPlayer = INDEXENT(i);
            
            
            if (pPlayer)
            {
                  
                  if(pPlayer->v.flags & (FL_CLIENT))
                  {
                        if(IsAlive(pPlayer))
                        {
                              pPlayer->v.frags += 1;
                              ClientKill(pPlayer);

                  
                              }
                        }
                  }
            }
      }//End for loop



My code works fine killing one person by using something similar to:

code:

if (FStrEq(pcmd, "endround"))
{
    ClientKill(pEntity);
}



However, the second i try to kill every player by using a For...Loop, Half Life Freezes. I have never had this problem before, and if i have made a little mistake in the code above please tell me. Any help would be appreciated...

[EDITED]
I know it is the For...Loop because i have removed ever piece of code except for ClientKill(pPlayer); in the For...Loop, and thats all that makes Half Life Freeze (though that was a useful add-on so you didn't ask how i thought i knew) :)

I made a function to do this in my bot a while back and it works okay (well in the MOD i use for it anyway), here is the code.

code:

void UTIL_KillAll(void)
{
      int i;
      
      edict_t *killent = NULL;
      
      for( i = 1; i <= gpGlobals->maxClients; i ++ )
      {
            killent = INDEXENT(i);
            
            if(killent)
            {      
                  if(killent->v.deadflag == DEAD_NO)
                  {
                        if(killent->v.netname)
                        {
                              ClientKill(killent);
                        }
                  }
            }
      }
}

It still doesn't work :(

I have no idea whats happening but whenever i try and use it it just sits there. I call the function and nothing happens. I've added:
code:

ClientPrint(pEntity, HUD_PRINTTALK, "Testing...testing...1...2...3");


to the KillAllClients() function to see if it is actually calling what it is supposed to be. And IT IS!! It prints but never kills all clients :(

If anyone knows why this could be happening, please help me!!

Phreak, replace
code:

if (pPlayer)


with
code:

if (FNullEnt (pPlayer))


Not all valid entity pointers actually point to a valid entity. Some pointers do point to nowhere.

Thanks guys, but it still didn't work. CS JUST FREEZES! Iv'e even tried Count Floyds UserNewRoundAll() function posted in a post on these forums. They all either don't work or freeze CS. Is my Half Life a bit stuffed? I have coded these before and they have never frozen CS. This time it has. If noone can think of anything, I may have to re-install...


I appreciate the help...but its not working at all


Anyone?

try giving the engine a bit of time...

you could kill one player each frame, instead of all at once if that helps...

code:


...
#include...
...
#define...
...

bool kill_players = FALSE;
int current_player_to_kill = 1;




code:

void StartFrame ( void )
{
 ..

  if ( kill_players )
  {
     if ( current_player_to_kill > gpGlobal->maxClients )
     {
        current_player_to_kill = 1;
        kill_players = FALSE;
     }
     else
     {
        edict_t *pKill = INDEXENT(current_player_to_kill);

        if ( pKill && !FNullEnt(pKill) )
           ClientKill(pKill);

        current_player_to_kill++;
     }
  }    

   ...
}



code:

void ClientCommand ( void )
{
  ...
  ...
  else if ( FStrEq(pcmd,"killall") )
     kill_players = TRUE;
  else if ...
  ...
}

Cheesemonster: You are a life saver :) It worked..
I have credited it and have made note about my current Half-Life state and how i code in the future.

Thanks again

Still, there has to be a bug somewhere else then. Intrinsically, the fact of calling several ClientKill() per frame, even for all clients, cannot make the engine crash. I have a "killall" server command in my bot also, which kills every client in one frame, and everything works okay.
