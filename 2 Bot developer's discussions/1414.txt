HI! I haven't woreked with textfiles in C++ but I know them in PASCAL and DELPHI good. I want to make something like that: entitie that will display TEXT string 0 from file MODDIR/test.txt
How can I do that. Or how can I work with TEXTFILES in C++? In DELPHI it is very comfortable because of TStringList.

Hmm yeah Deplhi's object oriented approach does simplify text handling. I like Cs way of creating your own character arrays to hold strings but it would seem complicated to me if I learned Delphi first I think.

The most important thing for file access is to become comfortable with commands like printf and scanf to read/write whole lines, and then there are commands for reading in individual characters and integers/floats, etc.

Look in the HPB_bot source and search for bot_whine.txt , then you can get an example of text file access by looking at how the bots read chat from a file... there will also be more complicated file access examples in WaypointLoad and WaypointSave
