They both are about the same difficulty level as far as use is concerned.  The Borland command line compiler is MUCH faster than the MinGW compiler is, so finding and fixing errors will take you less time with Borland (since you spend less time waiting for the code to compile).

hmm... why you just thinking about the easiest compiler? with compiler you just can do some cimpiling.. but you said that you want to make you own bot.

i think you need some c++ software out there..

MSVC is probably the easiest to use compiler (once you've learned all the functions and understand how to change compiler options for the project).  But, since MSVC isn't free, if you aren't willing to pay the money for it, you are forced to learn how to use what's available to you for free.

I have 2 pcs with xp, and 1 pc with redhat linux 7.2. I juss got Visual Studio, and already have begun pulling apart the HPB bot source, and the RAAC source. I will need to do more research on getting the dll to work. I hope all goes well.
