Im helping create a mod similar to TFC, but without classes, and much more hardcore action.

Anyways, we will be including Botmans' Bot #10 in the mod.

My question to you guys, is what are some features we should add to the bot to give it a "killing-machine" feel? Should it dodge and strafe while in action? Should it sneak up on you? Should it throw molotovs at you from within the shadows of a building? Should it talk smack to you? We want your advice.

I know someone might point out that I should put this in the forum at the mod site, but it has to do with bots and I need some site visitors so Im posting here :D
