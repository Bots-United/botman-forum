Newbie to bot programming.

I did a search to see if anyone has been successful using the Borland compiler but I haven't been able to turn up anything useful. I see that people have been able to use the free command line compiler. Does anyone know the procedure for using a full Borland compiler edition? I am selfishly trying to save time.

Apply the patches to the sdk, and convert the visual c++ project file to a borland one.
Then compile.

Please note that you may need to add linkfunc.cpp into the project.
