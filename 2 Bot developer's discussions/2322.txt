Has anyone tried making another floyd table that stores danger levels (maybe danger = kills/deaths ) instead of distances?

Do you think it's a good idea?

why not just make a new waypoint flag such as W_FL_DANGER :) And give it to waypoints so a bot will know what waypoints are danger waypoints.

Coz I would like the bots to use the Floyd Algo to find the "safest path"

why not do it like A*? Probably floyd does this too? 

Simply add a weight value, and try to find the lowest weight when finding a path..

What i'm trying to say is to create another floyd lookup table that stores "danger levels" instead of distances, modify the WaypointRouteFromTo function so that it can use the new table. This will result to safest paths...

Ah I see :) I was going to do a similar thing with CS so the bots wont goto paths that included crouching waypoints when rescuing hostages. But I checked out the floyd stuff in the template and couldn't make heads or tails with it! :-/

You could tackle this kind of problem by computing a second Floyd/Warshall table, using a cost function that takes danger (and traveltime) into account. (So, don't change the Floyd algorith, just change the cost function). However, that's a big (in memory and construction costs) hammer to hit a nail. 

Additionally, the results typically are less than satisfactory. 'Smarter paths' (than shortest paths) usually are smart because they take into account dynamic dangers (the current position of the enemy) rather than abstract and historical data (such as the #kills).

The A* algorithm is the 'Swiss Army Knife' of pathfinding algorithms, and you can adapt it to the kind of pathfinding you are looking for.
However, doing so isn't easy (and therefor very few commercial FPS games do so).

Look for the Doug Reece paper on www.cgf-ai.com/links.htmlmy links page for some more info.

p.s. to the original question: yes, it's a good idea and works wonders when you are able to implement it

ok, thanks william!

haven't really tried your bot (don't have quake 2) but i bet it is a kick ass bot!
