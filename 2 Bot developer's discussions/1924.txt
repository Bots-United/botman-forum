I was just wondering how to add commands that can be entered into the server console/ rcon(im assuming if u create a server command rcon automatically works for it, right?), because all i see is "ClientCommand" no "ServerCommand".

Look at the pfnAddServerCommand() function in the engine\eiface.h file of the Standard SDK.

just wondering, why did you choose to use CVARs for your bot commands instead of pfnAddServerCommand?  And also, is there any kind of checking i need to do for pfnAddServerCommand, or will only the listenserver guy in a non-dedic or rcon in a dedicated have access to it by default?

Because when the bot was created (over a year ago), the pfnAddServerCommand() did not exist.  The only work around was using CVARs.

Server commands can only be executed on the server (for dedicated servers this implies that rcon is being used or that someone entered the command on the dedicated server console).

I don't think server commands can be executed by any clients (otherwise you would just put in the ClientCommand function).  I don't know if the listenserver client can execute server commands or not (I would assume so, but I've never tried it.).  Try it yourself to find out.
