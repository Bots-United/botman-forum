You need your bots to choose the right class etc properly when the appropriate menus are shown. The blitz bot source code should already have that.

8 should be..

1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128 in hex, which would be FF i think

Hi RedLink,

0xFF should give you 8 options, which from my findings (might be wrong) is the maximum.

Also make sure that the numbers are assigned (trust me this took me ages to work out!) i.e (for me anyway) if the numbers didn't select a weapon then they weren't assigned so I couldn't use it for the menu - you can probably assign them manually - I don't know I didn't look into it.

CW.

theres a function called tohex(NUMBER)

remember, look for libary functions instead of having to make one up yourself!

For all ten buttons (1-9 plus 0) it would be...

0x3FF

...just make sure you have bound the buttons to slot commands like www.planethalflife.com/wavelength/coding/tutorials/15.htmthis.
