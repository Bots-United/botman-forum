hi

I'll get too the point :)

what im aiming for is for bots to make realistic escapes when they feel
they are loosing a fight. I have this working spot on, but the way i
have created it is so that they just turn and run. Now this way is ok
but ideally the bot would run off firing at the enemy its escaping from.

Is there a way i can make the bot follow his waypoint route but instead of
facing the waypoint its currently moving towards, face the enemy instead. I havnt actually tried this yet because im in a bit of a puzzle on were to start.

anyhelp would be appreciated 

ta
