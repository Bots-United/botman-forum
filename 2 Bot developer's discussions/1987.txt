I am working on a mod called World War III.  I am using bot10 because hpb_bot is separate and cant access private player data( in player.h ).  I tried using hpb_bot but the bots never shot each other.  I found out why, v.team was the same for all of the bots.  So every time i try to get bot10 to join teams, the game crashes.  Please help!!!

The only thing I can suggest is enable Debug mode on MSVC and run the MOD using the debugger.  This will tell you where it's crashing.
