me again.  just to make it clear I know what a varabile is, I just dont know the specific names of the ones used in CS (it doesnt use open source).  I figured it out though.  I am still having trouble.  I want to make a bot from scratch, I just need a basic startup.  I need just basic help on what I would need to do to make a bot.  Also I cant get the source for the HPB bot to compile with the Borland 5.5 command line compiler.  HELP

When you say you can't get the source to compile, what do you mean?  Are you getting errors?  Which errors?  Are you having problems figuring out what you are supposed to do?  You need to be a little more specific.

As far as how to figure out how Half-Life and MODs work, you should read the MOD FAQ on my website.  Download the Half-Life SDK and look through it to see how Half-Life handles weapons, ammo, ladders, water, players, etc.  Read through some of the tutorials on Half-Life coding web sites (found in the MOD FAQ) to see what types of modifications are possible.

Also, the best thing you can do is read through many of the posts in this forum.  Change that, read through ALL of the posts on this forum.  There's over 500 threads in the "Bot developer's discussion" forum, and many of them contain information that you will need to know.

Don't ask someone to show you how to do things until you done as much as you possibly can on your own to figure out how things work.  Nobody is going to take the time to show you every single thing you need to know to create a bot because there is just way too much stuff to explain all at one time.

Start out small.  Don't try to understand everything at once.  Take the time to learn on your own and understand things at your own pace.  But don't even get started in the first place if you're not willing to dedicate several months to learn what to do and how things work.  I guarantee you that you won't learn it all in just a few weeks.

I would probably be better to actually look at how the HPB_bot intercepts CS stuff, as I don't think that there won't be a better way to do it (Botman is a very good programmer, and does things the 'proper' way, not the 'easy' way).

I don't see much point in starting from scratch... u will end up with the same results (or worse) than Botman, even though u will have a better understanding of the code.

If you want to start 'from scratch', then why don't you just keep all of Botman's TFC/CS/FLF intercept functions, then just make your own version of bot.cpp, bot_combat.cpp, bot_navigate.cpp... the hardest part of making the bot is actually getting it to emulate a client (taking damage and so on) I think, so just use Botman's base code and add your own AI (like other bot authors). Maybe once you can make your own version of the HPB_bot, you will then know enough to be able to make a bot from scratch (maybe even for a whole new game like Halo/Duke Nukem Forever!!)
