I wanna restore bunny hopping to TFC, CS and other mods I just need to know where to start on changing the physics? (Or maybe a command or something)

Found this code in the SDK:

code:

// Only allow bunny jumping up to 1.7x server / player maxspeed setting
#define BUNNYJUMP_MAX_SPEED_FACTOR 1.7f

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Purpose: Corrects bunny jumping ( where player initiates a bunny jump before other
//  movement logic runs, thus making onground == -1 thus making PM_Friction get skipped and
//  running PM_AirMove, which doesn't crop velocity to maxspeed like the ground / other
//  movement logic does.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
void PM_PreventMegaBunnyJumping (void)
{
      // Current player speed
      float spd;
      // If we have to crop, apply this cropping fraction to velocity
      float fraction;
      // Speed at which bunny jumping is limited
      float maxscaledspeed;

      maxscaledspeed = BUNNYJUMP_MAX_SPEED_FACTOR * pmove->maxspeed;

      // Don't divide by zero
      if ( maxscaledspeed <= 0.0f )
            return;

      spd = Length( pmove->velocity );

      if ( spd <= maxscaledspeed )
            return;

      fraction = ( maxscaledspeed / spd ) * 0.65; //Returns the modifier for the velocity

      VectorScale( pmove->velocity, fraction, pmove->velocity ); //Crop it down!.
}

void PM_Jump (void)
{
      if ( pmove->dead )
      {
            pmove->oldbuttons = IN_JUMP ;      // don't jump again until released
            return;
      }

      if ( pmove->maxspeed == 1 )
            return;

      // See if we are waterjumping.  If so, decrement count and return.
      if ( pmove->waterjumptime )
      {
            pmove->waterjumptime -= pmove->cmd.msec;
            if (pmove->waterjumptime < 0)

      // If we are in the water most of the way...
      if (pmove->waterlevel >= 2)
      {      // swimming, not jumping
            pmove->onground = -1;

            if (pmove->watertype == CONTENTS_WATER)    // We move up a certain amount
                  pmove->velocity[2] = 100;

            return;            // in air, so no effect
      }

      if ( pmove->oldbuttons & IN_JUMP )
            return;            // don't pogo stick
      
      // In the air now.
    pmove->onground = -1;

      PM_PreventMegaBunnyJumping();

      pmove->velocity[2] += 295;

      // Decay it for simulation

      // Flag that we jumped.
      pmove->oldbuttons = IN_JUMP;      // don't jump again until released

Was wandering if I could modify it too work..

There's a metamod plugin that supposedly restores bunny hopping.

Well I've looked everywhere for it and can't seem to find that metamod plugin, hmm..
