I need you guys to test out my program and tell me if you like it.  All it does is make it easier to convert text to hex code and make it easy to insert into your source code.  Try it please?

Thanx,

Hey does anyone care about this?!?  Oh well no-one cares if I made a program to help with {HEX Code} : <b>members.nbci.com/blind_20/tnhx.zipHere!</b>

Yes, nice program...

I don't have much use for it at the moment, but i'm sure i will use it some time....

/me downloads it agian after loosing his downloads folder..

i don't know what to do with this program. When i want a string in a c/C++ program, i use something like char szWeissdergeierwas[]="dasfhsdihfb"; and if I wanted to have it as int, converting isn't a problem. So what is this program good for ?

Well I think it would be better to use Hex in your programs for text mainly because it would be alot harder for someone to hack the text and say its their program.

Look an Example:code:


// This is a test of Text-> Hex Converter by Brian L.\n

int example[] =
{
0x54,0x68,0x69,0x73,0x20,0x69,0x73,0x20,0x61,0x20,
0x74,0x65,0x73,0x74,0x20,0x6f,0x66,0x20,0x54,0x65,
0x78,0x74,0x2d,0x3e,0x48,0x65,0x78,0x20,0x43,0x6f,
0x6e,0x76,0x65,0x72,0x74,0x65,0x72,0x20,0x62,0x79,
0x20,0x42,0x72,0x69,0x61,0x6e,0x20,0x4c,0x2e,0x00
};

void hex_text(void)
{
int index;
char buffer[255];

  while(example[index] != 0x00) // Get Hex change to text.
  {                             
    buffer[index] = example[index];
    index++;
  }

  buffer[index] = 0;
  printf("%s\n",buffer); // <--- Prints the changed text
}




See what I'm trying to tell ya guys.

But if someone was using a Hex editor, the only thing they would see is the ASCII text string (not the C hex values).

It would be better if your program could XOR the input string with a specified Hex value and print out the XORed value of the input character and the Hex value.  Then have a similar routine that takes the array of Hex chars and XORs them back against the same specified value to arrive at the original string.

I used to use hex to text conversion to include bitmaps into arrays for demos during '95 compo days. However, ever since MS introduced resources, it's more memory efficient to include them as resources than to pile them into text. As for encryption, forget it. I'm sorry, but you can't stop me from writing my name into your code and redistribute. (1) However, if people can do things like me, they'll probably find more satisfaction on writing their own code. XOR is definitely bad. I can easily spot it by looking at your binary file. I suggest a simple matrix multiplication and inversion as a lot of newbie crackers out there have no clue when it comes to "higher" math ;) (2) If they do figure out how to do "higher" math (reversible cryptography of course) they'll most likely stop, reflect on what they're doing as a lame thing, and revert to point (1).

my 2 cents...

Animadei -

code:

Decrypt this for me then and tell me what it is?
It's text not symbols just to let you know. :-)

int yep[] =
{
0xffffffb2,0xffffffde,0xffffffea,
0x40,0xffffffce,0xffffffde,
0xffffffe8,0x40,0xffffffe8,
0xffffffd0,0xffffffd2,0xffffffe6,
0x42,0x00
};



Have fun!

"You are good!" But not really. Isn't there something better you'd like to self-improve upon than to pick my brain?

Mmmm... I think it rather means "You got this!" Simple multiplication by 2. How did you get your result, Animadei?!?

"You are good!" <--- Wrong!

<b>Tobias</b>, I didn't ;) I just took a look at it and said this is boring and saw it had low entropy so I took a quick guess as a joke ;)

<b>Brain</b>, did you happen to read my message or were you more interested in knowing an answer? ("Haha you got it wrong, you suck!" isn't exactly smart). I'd like to point out that giving any random bytes is in itself encrypted. Because you have not shown a method for decryption, there are no reversible methods and can't be developed from ciphertext attack since you haven't provided a second encrypted string. Since you care to play these kind of fruitless games, then play mine. ACT-1, this is a very well known 'crackme' challenge I wrote for the cracking community. The initial purpose was to show that anyone can write a crackme and it's time to stop writing them. If you can't find it, no problem. Search the web. http://search.dogpile.com/texis/search?q=ACT-1+crackme&geo=no&fs=web

Alright I'll get serious here and write one up real quick.

I'll post the download soon for it to see if you get it! heh.
