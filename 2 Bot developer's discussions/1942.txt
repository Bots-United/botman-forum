If one disables the shooting funktionality from the HPB template, the bots are "shaking" when aiming at you.

How come?
How to make them stop doing that?

The "shaking" has to do with how the bots aim.  The bots are constantly (every frame) picking a random location in space around the player to aim at.  If you don't want them wiggling around then you should also remove the call to BotShootAtEnemy() since this is the function that does the aiming (by calling BotBodyTarget).
