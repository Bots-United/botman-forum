I'm adding another utility in the next release of my BSP tools.  It's called BSP slicer.  It can make "slices" along the Z axis of a map and output those slices to a bitmap file.

Here's the output from cs_assault with all the slices combined into a single "contour" map...

Now people can create 2D layouts of maps for strategy purposes without much trouble at all! :)

This took about 2 seconds to generate...

It looks a little cluttered.  Does it make any sense to you?

I asked for de_vertigo because its pretty vertical, and destined to produce a cluttered slice graph.

Nevetheless, impressive tool. 

What I did for for AQ2 with many multi-level accesible spaces is generating two maps: upper 50%, and lower. (I generated images from the waypoint graph, not the BSP - see http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/design_terrain_ranking.shtml).

Should be a simple option to add: slice range per image.

Here's another pass at de_train with slices at every 16 units on the Z axis (the default is every 64 units)...

...you can see the stairs more clearly in this one.

wow. Now add some color for heights into it and it's almost perfect!

impressive indeed! Nice work botman!
Btw, /me compiled bsp_tools with succes! It seems only your sources botman are the ones i can compile at once.  :D

Have you tried to change color on hieght diferences (like every 192 units) this could help you determine what level they are on. However with things like ramps and stairs it could suck.   :P

Yes, colors do cause problems for areas that overlap.

After I release the source code, anyone will be free to download it and add as much color as they want. :)

Yeah it sounds great...

to Botman: I have a bug for u in 0.1 The Tools...

When u compile a map (make waypoints for them)..
and it is a DMC map the waypoint is made on the lava thats bad the bots run into it and die... Plz fixe this..

Yes, currently the lava is treated like water.

I've updated the BSP tools utilities, but I didn't change anything in the automatic waypoint generator code.

I'll start working on some enhancements and fixes for it over the next few days (since I'm off work for the Thanksgiving holidays) and I should have something a little better for the automatic waypoint generator in the next week or two.

An idea:

A few weeks ago, I wrote a program that created gradients. When you guys thought about coloring the height, I gigured out how to use my code in BSP_Slicer

The color of a height in RGB format can be figured out by this equation:

Redadjust + CurrentZPosition / (TotalLevelHeight / 255)

Greenadjust + CurrentZPosition / (TotalLevelHeight / 255)

Blueadjust + CurrentZPosition / (TotalLevelHeight / 255)

Say that Redadjust is 255, Greenadjust is 255, and Blue adjust is 0, the equation will create a darker form of yellow when CurrentZPosition is lower.

Redajust=255, Greenadjust=255, Blueadjust=0, CurrentZPosition=1, will generate RGB(255,255,0), a pure yellow color.

A bit of the gradient code (it was done in VB) follows:

For i = 1 To Me.Height
    Me.Line (0, i)-(Me.Width, i), RGB(i / (Me.Height / 255) + 255, i / (Me.Height / 255) + 255, i / (Me.Height / 255) + 0)
Next

I hope this helps!
