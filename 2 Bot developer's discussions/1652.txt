Ok to start off with the first idea...
Bizier pathways/move waypoint for waypoint editing

yes botman i know you think this is proly going to be boring to do but i didnt mean for you to do them its just an idea so :P. any how the way that i thought of them was kinda crude such as adding 2 nodes to each pathway with a curve and also a move node and select node option so that you could select the node/waypoint then move to the destination where you wanted the new one and move the node/waypoint to that position. 

2nd idea
precalculated paths for bot navigation

this one ive tried to do but hehe its working out nice with dij algo mixed wit a lil bit of my own algo however the bots are still on the same set of waypoints they had b4 only now you have a start point for your path and an end point start is what bot looks for when he ends a path and end is when he starts looking and the idea is to have many waypoints and paths between the start and end of a precalculated path.

Ive gotten it to work but at high memory expence. The idea was mainly for getting the bot to recognize flanking like around objects without messing with bsp. so when the enemy is mostly at a certain point the bot will not just go the same way that he would normaly go but try to go behind the flank where he could get a good camp/snipe spot on his enemy or other things such as use turrets or climb a ladder and push a button then come back down the ladder. Hope like the ideas:P 
 
P.S. 
the reason it has high memory expence is because i used a few floats and double floats where you would normaly use int and lil stuff like that im purdy sure i could go back and change it to work better with memory :)

Actually the Floyd-Warshall shortest path finding navigation that I'm using now works very well.  The bots are always able to find the shortest path from any location in the map to any other location in the map.  Because I don't do any additional processing on the Floyd matrix, this leads to fairly predicatable navigation patterns (i.e. you always know which way the bot will go when heading for the flag).  I can live with this limitation and have no plans to rewrite the HPB bot navigation code.
