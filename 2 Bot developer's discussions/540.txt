Ok, i've got a couple of questions that i thought you guys could help me out with so here they are.

1. How do i change the bots FOV so that they can se at 180 degrees? everytime i try it never works. i know where to find the FOV code but when i change it, there is no effect on the bot.

2. How can i make the bot see things such as ammo bags/medkits/armor? I know that there is an a flag for these but i want to make the bot go after these itmes if they are in his/her FOV and they aren't to far away or not needed ( a.k.a. they have full ammo/health )

3. How do i make the bots respond to sounds. I founds something about this in the code so the bots hear footsteps if they are a certain distance near them and the noise is loud enough but i want to rework this for other things ( a.k.a. some of my other buggy code, hehe )

well, if you can help me with any of these problems that would be great.

Responding to 1. and 2.:

Bots don't really have a field of view since they don't see anything. You can simulate a field of view by comparing the vector to the entity you want to check and the bot's forward vector. Compute the dotproduct of the normalized vectors and compare it to 0: if it's greater the entity lies in front of the bot (=180 degree fov). If you want a smaller fov, you have to compare to a different value, e.g. around 0.6 for a 90 degree fov - 0.6 should be the sin of (90/2).
Don't forget to normalize the vectors before calculating the dotproduct.
To make the bot "see" entities you have to go through all entities in a specific range (use UTIL_FindEntityInSphere), do this dotproduct thing
and a trace to determine if there aren't any walls that block the view.

You may not have noticed it but this forum does have a "Search" feature (up at the top).  When I click on "Search" and enter "sounds" as the keyword to search for (and click on the little radio button after the "Search by keyword(s)", here's one of the threads that I get...

Please try to use the "Search" feature to answer your own questions in the future.  It will save us all a lot of time.

I have made a hearing code for my bot.
I search the world for players and than I will see if their in a sertain distance and then I check if they are doing something that will make noise. If they make noise the, bot will turn to the player.
