ok,

Now I can spawn some bot already in Firearms.
But after they died, they didnt respawn.

any idea on which function captures the messages
to respawn and death?

Besides that, they do not fire at the opposite team. How do u make them recognize different teams?

There is a part in BotThink in bot.cpp that makes the bots press fire to respawn after they die. I don't know what you do in FireArms to respawn, but find that part of BotThink and edit it to do what you want
