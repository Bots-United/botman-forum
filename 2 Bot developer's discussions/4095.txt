Hey...

I have been parsing randomly through the header files of the SDK and I've noticed this very interesting structure...
code:

typedef struct customization_s
{
      qboolean bInUse;     // Is this customization in use;
      resource_t resource; // The resource_t for this customization
      qboolean bTranslated; // Has the raw data been translated into a useable format?  
                                       //  (e.g., raw decal .wad make into texture_t *)
      int        nUserData1; // Customization specific data
      int        nUserData2; // Customization specific data
      void *pInfo;          // Buffer that holds the data structure that references the data (e.g., the cachewad_t)
      void *pBuffer;       // Buffer that holds the data for the customization (the raw .wad data)
      struct customization_s *pNext; // Next in chain
} customization_t;


It appears to be used by PlayerCustomization() in the game DLL API.

Wouldn't it be a new path to investigate in order to have the bots spraying custom decals ? if we could record a sort of pldecal.wad from the server side for them...

Has anyone investigated this possibility yet ?

Yes, I have.  Walk through the customization stuff in the SDK and you'll see why it doesn't work.
