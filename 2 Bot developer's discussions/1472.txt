I've been thinking about this for a long time..
Yet, no-one has even tried it. They all presume its impossible :-)

Hmm... the vgui. Stupid thing... the vgui.lib can only be used by visual c++, therfor its a bybye for free compilers :-(

I think its possible to create a client.dll thats loads the client.dll compiled with a free compiler and provide vgui access to it via callback features.
(Much like the half-life engine interface)

The point is, that the vgui is managed by the client.dll loader, so the loaded client.dll could access it via easy callback features.
The loaded dll could also have access to normal engine functions, like the hpb_bot.

Can someone just try this? It was possible with the server.dll, why wouldn't it be possible with the client.dll?

Hehe we could do it if we had some sort of api for vgui. Or lots of free time. :P
