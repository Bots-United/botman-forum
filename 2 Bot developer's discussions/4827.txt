when i use my bot with steam my bot menu(same concept as pod-bot/hpb-bot) doesnt show up 
anymore. Although i can still make menu choices, it only just doesnt show up.

If this is for Counter-Strike, perhaps Valve removed the text menu support from the CS client.

If this is the case, you'll probably have to create your own "menu" system by sending regular text strings to specific client screen positions (simulating the display of a menu) and bind keys to commands that handle "menu selections" (i.e. bind 1 "menuselect 1", bind 2 "menuselect 2", etc.), the process those commands as you do now (as if they had come from the old client menu system).

Emulating a message handler for the text menu messages should not be infeasible at all either...

If it's true that the CS team removed the textmenu message, maybe I'll write a metamod plugin to restore it then (emphasis on: "maybe").

hmm well how can i display this right ? so far i only can use;

code:

ClientPrint(listenserver_edict,HUD_PRINTCENTER,MenuTextHere);


well this has an annyoing (small) char limit and centers the text

code:

UTIL_SayText(MenuTextHere, listenserver_edict);


this doesnt 'print enters'

though
code:

ClientPrint(listenserver_edict,HUD_PRINTNOTIFY,MenuTextHere);


only prints the text in console now, though its printed good

well anyone now any other methods ? :(

Look in some open source bot source code to find out how to display a message to clients using hudtextparms. Else, have a look at my mapedit plugin which has quite good examples of it (source code included) here:

I believe the PODbot code uses the hudtextparms stuff.

im sure this will be fixed in steam soon. The reason the menu isnt working because lots of client stuff isnt done with steam, for some reason... Svencoop are having the same troubles with steam (client problems) it seems as though it doesnt even read its client dll and uses the steam client which may not have menus in it yet
