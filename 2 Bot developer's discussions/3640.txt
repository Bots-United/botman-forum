I've created several interfaces (with many more to come) that work as a admin_mod interface with Botman's metamod plugins.

Mspawn spawns Monsters with typical command parameters
BotSpawn spawns Bots with typical command parameters
Mrand spawns monsters randomly (1 per execution) on a target

projects being polished:

Monattack takes a vote from the players on whether or not they want to spawn N number of monsters around <player> to kill them
Moninvasion 1/0 takes a vote from the players on whether or not they want to move to a map where monsters spawn continuously for the duration of the map (or have them spawn by players during the current map) toggled by vote either way.

Adding support for admin recognition and spawn overflow protection in the next couple of days.  Visit often and watch for the version number to go up.
