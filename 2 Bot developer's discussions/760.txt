My bot isnt turning out very well at the moment. Its not the bot itslef, the bot is good, the only problem is I DONT REALLY KNOW C++ SO I CANT GET THE WAYPOINT SYSTEM TO WORK!!!!!!!!!!! ARGH!!!!!

I am going to learn it though. Im probably going to be getting Microstf Visual C++ soon and I bought some books on C and C++ from an online store.

Surprisingly, without any basic knowledge of C++ I was able to figure out how to get medics to heal you and how to get bots to toss grenades at enemies. So untill I get to know more, Im not going to work on the bot.

I will be making some bot-friendly TFC maps though. Im working on one right now Im calling "R3tarded animal zoo". Its a zoo, but I put animals in the cages that look retarded and just sit there and stare (a func_breakable with animal textures). I wish TFC would let you add monsters from regular Half-Life because than I could just make new skins for the aliens and put them in the zoo. It will be a Command point map.

I have played a map with a monster before. It was a mini version of that huge flame shooting thing from halflife... I was behind a wall that I didn't know how to get to the other side of but with spectator mode i got there and the thing was moving
the map is called escape
