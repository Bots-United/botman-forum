Ok now i got a Few questions and stuff, Ok first how would i turn the command 'addbot' in to a server side command, and how would i make hpb-bot show up a menu like the radio menus in cstrike, the old menu system, and last thing that i need help with is that my bot in firearms just sites that and does nothing, does not move from it's spawn point, does not shoot, does not look around, i need to fix that, and there is a mod that i am doing pre-release beta testing for and we have the players with legs, arms, etc falling off as you shoot them and as a head falls off a normal player would have no view of any thing, how would i make the bot do that should tell you that basicly how would i make it change the distance of view after it is a certain model, and how would i make it change the speed that the bot is walking after a change of model..

To make a dedicated server command the easiest way I've found is to declare your own CVAR.  Set the CVAR to the value of the command you want to execute then check (every second or so) to see if the value of the CVAR has changed.  If so, execute the command based on that CVAR value.  For example in the HPB bot source template code, I create a CVAR called "bot".  You set that CVAR to "addbot 1 3" to add a bot to team 1 using class 3.  It would look like this from the dedicated server console...

bot "addbot 1 3"

...In the code where you check if "bot" is set to anything, just read the CVAR, figure out what the command is, then set the CVAR back to "" to prevent the command from being executed multiple times.

You can add new VGUI commands by modifying the "commandmenu.txt" file for that MOD (if it uses VGUI).  If it doesn't use VGUI you can use the UTIL_ShowMenu() function to display a text menu on the client's HUD.  Look at some of the Half-Life coding sites for tutorials on using the text menu.

The bots move, shoot, fall, etc just like normal players.  There is a field in the entvars_t structure called "button".  You set button to values that the client would normally set them to to get the bot to jump (IN_JUMP), duck (IN_DUCK), or shoot the weapons (IN_ATTACK, or IN_ATTACK2).

I suggest you download the HPB bot template version and look at how that bot moves, and fires.
