GREETINGS.....I can compile the original source code for the bot version 10 ..no errors. I'm using
MingW32, when I get into my lan game with my code no bots will join??? It has to be something simple I'm sure cause I ain't screwing with anyting but the original code ...I just want to see it work before I start messing with the code??? Oh and the dll does work from botman for version bot10...very well by the way...you are quite the coder botman.
