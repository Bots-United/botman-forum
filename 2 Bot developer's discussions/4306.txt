Any one know how to change a map with another file?

I've seen this in some mod where they could add stuff in a diffrent file. I wan't to add Walls with another file. 

I wan't to add walls for maps, anybody know how?
I know you can change as i said i've seen it in a mod. But they've only added entiyes. Added Weapons and so on. 

Anybody? ;)

ripent from Zoner's Half-Life tools will allow you to add or remove entities from a map.

You can also do this with my Stripper2 plugin.

Walls (brush models) can't be created on the fly, they can only be copied from walls that already exist in the map.  See this thread...

Hmm,k

I want to duplicate each wall on a map but just make it a layer. If you have 3x walls you can't see true them. I've tested this on one of my own maps and if you add 3x layers of walls that you just can see but can walk true. Then you can't use WallHack because WallHack can only see true 2 Walls. If i just could come up with a easy way to add a small layer of func_(don't remember the name right now =)

Can you add any kind of func_ this way?

IMHO, this would mess a lot of things up.

It would certainly mess the PVS, and probably a lot of dynamically-fired Tracelines wouldn't hit their objectives. The game behaviour would be affected a lot.

This is purely assumptive, but I think it would at least generate quite a lot of lag on the server (and also on the clients) if any wall of the map would have a tripled image through an arbitrary func_wall entity. Do you know how many faces a standard HL map has ? You simply can't create that much of func_wall entities. Not even 10%.

Maybe I'm wrong about the lag, but I would be surprised to be.

You can't just dynamically add walls anywhere you want in a map.

Download WinBSP, decompile the map, fix all the misaligned textures using WorldCraft, add the new walls that you want, recompile the map, then let clients download that map when connecting to your server.

You can't do things the way you want to.
