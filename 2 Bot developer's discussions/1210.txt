I have more or less given up on my Counter-Strike beta 5 bot.

I can't get it to join the game AT ALL.
If anyone can fix it, i'd apreciate it.
( plz send me the source fix aswell {^_^} )

Yeah, could happen: Showing waypoints means sending messages to the server, e.g. drawThisOrThat for a special client. This client should be you (you are the one that wants to see the things on your screen, right?). Obviously you are passing a wrong edict to the engine. You should debug that where the message actually gets send (somewhere in the waypoint.cpp I suppose) - just in case you are still motivated :-)

I think the whole messaging system is affected. I solved the first message error (in ClientPrint by commenting it out)

The next error i had is when it called the player() and ClientConnect stuff...
The engine crashed!

Well, hmm, you don't actually solve errors by commenting them out - that would be like repairing a car by pushing it where you want to go... 
I don't think you could mess up the entire messaging system (provided you didn't change the macro definitions or other internals in the original HL-files). Have a look at the parameters, especially at the edicts that you are passing. If it's a bot edict, debug first in BotCreate and take notes of the value you've got there. Next, debug up to the function where the crash occurs: are you passing the same value as in BotCreate or did it get changed? I would bet you change your edicts somewhere in between...
