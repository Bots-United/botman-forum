I read about Gladiator bot ( http://www.botepidemic.com/gladiator/ ) and I think that using AAS files have much more potential than waypoints. 

However, I can't find *any* information about the .aas file format.

If anybody has some information about, please let me know.

Also, what do you guys think of a bot driven on AAS instead of waypoints?

Replace the 2nd A with an S :-)

Sounds like a great idea. You can use any format you like :D

Use the "Search" feature at the top of the page to search for "aas".  This topic has been discussed several times on this forum.

I know, I've already done that. I found the Gladiator Project that way, and some other discussions about navigation.

But I still didn't find an exact specification of the AAS file format, so that I can implement it.

...and you won't.  The AAS file is exclusively used by the Gladitor bot and was never released to the general public.

Hmmm... that stinks!

Are there any other possible options?? 
Maybe read .bsp file directly? There has to be some way of 'exploring' the map. 

This 'exploring' doesn't have to take place when the bot is running, it can be done 'before'. 

Any suggestions on this?

Yes, reading the .bsp file directly and creating your own version of an .aas file would be the thing to do.  Here's a thread with some great links to get you started understanding the .bsp file format...

...also don't forget that you can always download the Quake I source code to understand how it handles the BSP tree leaves and nodes.
