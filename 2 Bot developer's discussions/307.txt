If you are using MingW32, make SURE you have the GiveFnpt.dat file in the dlls directory when you use the "make" command.  Use "make clean" and try running "make" again (with the GiveFnpt.dat file).

Make sure your liblist.gam file is correct.  You might want to post the contents here if you have doubts.
