I'm trying to kill bot in cs but...
When I set health to 0 or -1 bot just gets killed (dying animation doesn't appear). But the game dont even notice it!!!
I'm trying to make newround command (by killing all bots the game will drows round and starts new round).
Enybody have idea??? (I setted and remove all flags typically for death and no changes)

hi,

you could try emulating the damage message to deal out 1000 damage, but i don't know if it would work.

bye,

It is very easy :)

To kill you in CS, you use the command 'kill'...
So you just need to use this command for the bot you wanna kill using the command :
FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "kill", NULL, NULL);

Thanks for reply.
But Paulo-La-Frite your idea of
FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "kill", NULL, NULL);
doesn't work. I have check it as first when i came on with killing idea.

BTW. How to drop weapons. Coz by FakeClientCommand
it also doesn't work...

I can't get it the "FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "kill", NULL, NULL);"-method working either. Anyone got an idea???

What about getting the buggers to simultainiously jump and set the gravity to 20000 in the next frame?

it will kill them in a jiffy. :)

The following code is what I did to kill off the bots between map changes and to only add them back if the new map contains waypoints. These changes were made in dll.cpp.


      if (strcmp(pClassname, "worldspawn") == 0)
      {
         // do level initialization stuff here...
         
       wpt_loaded = FALSE;
         // kick off the bots
         for (int i=0; i < 32; i++)
         {
            char cmd[80];
            if (bots[i].is_used)  // is this slot used?
            {

               sprintf(cmd, "kick \"%s\"\n", bots[i].name);

               SERVER_COMMAND(cmd);  // kick the bot using (kick "name")
               bots[i].is_used = FALSE;
            }
         }

         WaypointInit();
         WaypointLoad(NULL);

       ......
       ......

         g_GameRules = TRUE;
         if (wpt_loaded)
            file_opened = FALSE;
      }




void StartFrame( void )  .... Section

      if (g_GameRules)
      {
         if (!file_opened)  // have we open bot.cfg file yet?
         {

          ......
          ......
       }

       // Clear bots array
         for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++)
            memset(&bots[i], 0, sizeof(bot_t));


       ......
      }

No. It's not this what I'm looking for.
Because you kick bots and respawn them again. They lost their money, frags and change their names - just spawn a new bots.

If you want to kill some Clients (Bots) you could use ClientKill(). Here's a code snippet from my source which kills all players (even humans) in that round:
code:

void UserNewroundAll(edict_t *pEntity)
{
edict_t *pPlayer;
for (int ind = 1; ind <= gpGlobals->maxClients; ind++)
{
pPlayer = INDEXENT(ind);
// is this player slot is valid and it's not this bot...
if ((pPlayer) && (!pPlayer->free))
{

if (FBitSet(pPlayer->v.flags, FL_CLIENT) 
FBitSet(pPlayer->v.flags, FL_FAKECLIENT))
{
if(IsAlive(pPlayer))
      ClientKill(pPlayer);
}
}
}
ClientPrint( VARS(pEntity), HUD_PRINTNOTIFY,"Round Restarted !\n");
}



Hope this helps...

To say it with your own words:

But can i bind this kill function to a key? How will i do that?

bind k "kill"

This would bind the 'k' key to the command 'kill'. Just put this in you bot.cfg file (or type it in at the console)

Whose words were they????

Some wise stuff.

I re-wrote it however so it kills off all the bots if all the players in the server are dead (only works if players are in there)

It doesnt always give the teams the right scores after, but its damn useful. In version 4 im gonna make it an option. Instead of mandatory.
