I am working on a Metamod compatible bot and I am enhancing the waypoint editor (based on the HPB) and I have a lot of commands bound to specific keys.

For example:
      CLIENT_COMMAND (serverEntity, "bind \"ins\" \"menu1\"\n");
      CLIENT_COMMAND (serverEntity, "bind \"home\" \"menu2\"\n");
      CLIENT_COMMAND (serverEntity, "bind \"pgup\" \"menu3\"\n");
      CLIENT_COMMAND (serverEntity, "bind \"del\" \"menu4\"\n");
      CLIENT_COMMAND (serverEntity, "bind \"end\" \"menu5\"\n");
      CLIENT_COMMAND (serverEntity, "bind \"pgdn\" \"menu7\"\n");


My problem is these binds become permanent after my utility is run. They get saved into config.cfg

1)Is there a way to make these binds temporary?
2)If not is there a way to tell what command is bound to a key and then restore it on exit?

best bet is to use HalfLife's built in menu system. As then you can use the number keys, without having to worry about overwriting binds.

Alternativly, depending upon how you're using your program, you could exec config.cfg on the client before they exit the server to reinit their configs and repair their binds, but this is not a good method.

There is no better method than an ugly hack.

Manually retrieve what the binds are for, save them, run your program, SAVE the previous binds in a .cfg file to be executed the next time the server boots (add a line to exec it in autoexec.cfg for example). Then inside your program, you can bind your keys safely knowing that next time the server will start, they will be restored to the previous ones.
