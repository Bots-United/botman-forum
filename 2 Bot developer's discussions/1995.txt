Im working on more cool Human-AI interaction and have summed it up best with "Elements" as seen in that cool SWAT3: Close Quarters game.
 
i.e. when the bot issues orders, they will appear on the hud of the player as an Assignment (Im working on this right now) and possibly a visual marker on screen as to where their assignment is. (i.e. an x)

But the human players will have chance to issue the same orders to bots, using a menu system 

i.e. you hit the \ key and a new menu pops up:

= SQUAD CONTROL =
1. [SWAT]Neuter-----(Idle/Walking)
2. [SWAT]PharCyde---(Supression)
3. [SWAT]StephanH---(Idle/Combat)

5. All elements
6. Cancel


The element command menu will then change to:

Element Command
1. Supressive Fire
2. Grenade
3. Duck in position
4. Follow
5. Disperse

9. Cancel


I need feedback on what you want to see in this...and what orders you would like to be able to give? I just chose a few there to be reasonable.

Currently I can get it to pop up on the players screen for a few seconds..but how can I get an order to pop onto the players view and stay there for life (Ideally just above t

Hehe I like that little bit at the bottom of your sig :P

Anyhoo I think if you put in stuff like whats in Swat 3 then it will be fine.
You could also maybe have team specific ones for CT andT (I think your bot is for CS right ? )
For example find bomb site and defuse etc
