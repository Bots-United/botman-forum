Hi..

I got a problem with my bots and I'm really confused.

When I add the first bot, it works fine. That bot spawns and capture all vgui message, and finally spawn into the game.

But the second bot added doesnt seem to do this.
It will just go through BotStartGame() forever and ever, and there's no vgui menus option for its pBot->start_action.

If anyone had this problem  before, pls help me.

I did have that same problem, I either deleted all .o files or changed some code, this was a month ago or so I forgot

         // bot has now joined the game (doesn't need to be started)
         pBot->not_started = 0;
         return;

I think that you maybe need that on after if has gone through the "Join Battle" vgui. I might be wrong.

Hi...

Thanks a lot man...What I did was rebuild the whole DLL.. and it WORKS..
When you rebuild all, it deletes everything *.o files so it refreshes your compilation.

At least i know the logic is not wrong or I'll go nuts.

Hey..sorry I didn't reply your email coz the way you put it. If you dont mind, I would suggest that u write a bit more politely. Sorry if this offend u, but sincerely I think that would make your like better. 

Email me if you got anything ...I'll be glad to help. :)
