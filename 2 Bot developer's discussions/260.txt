It's works very well but I can't figure out how to check the ammo in the current weapon the bot is holding?

Here's some of the code I came up with:
code:

if (pBot->bot_class == TFC_CLASS_SCOUT)
  {
      if (distance > 550) 
      { 
       if (!(distance < 250)) 
       {
         if (!(distance > 800))
         {
          BotSwitch_Weapon("tf_weapon_ng", pBot);
         }
       }
      }
      else if (distance > 150) 
      {
       if (!(distance < 100))
       {
         if (!(distance > 250))
         {
          BotSwitch_Weapon("tf_weapon_shotgun", pBot);
         }
       }
      }
      else if (distance < 75) 
      {
        if (!(distance > 75))
        { 
         BotSwitch_Weapon("tf_weapon_axe", pBot);
        }
        }
  }



I'm a beginner in Programming C/C++ 
ok

Thanx

For starters, bot_class isn't ever filled in with the actual class (unless you're doing this yourself).  I used v.playerclass (for TFC) instead.  The bot_team and bot_class stuff was put there in case the entvars_t structure wasn't being filled in with the team number or class number (like in Counter-Strike).

Here's what I use to determine if there is enough ammo to use the primary fire...
code:
// check if no ammo required or enough ammo available...

if ((weapon_defs[iId].iAmmo1 == -1) OR
    (pBot->m_rgAmmo[weapon_defs[iId].iAmmo1] >= 1))
{
   // use primary fire to shoot weapon
}

This checks if there is unlimited ammo or at least 1 round of ammo left.  Checking secondary ammo is left as an excerise to the interested student as is checking how much ammo is available in the clip instead of in the weapons store.

It works perfect.  I added the distance to check if the bot's a Soldier with an RPG and too close he'll switch to a short range weapon.

(This is probably the last question to ask :))
