hi,

Thanks for having time to check this topic. So my odd problem is: Enemy bots dont shoot their enemies, and vice versa. Nobody shoots. =)

For general interest i started to play with the code, to CS. I´m aware that its unsupported 100%, but just for fun. I modified only the navigation code, to non-waypoint style. I think the problem is somewhere in edict_t *BotFindEnemy( bot_t *pBot ). Feels like the bot thinks that everybody is on the same team as he is.

Any ideas what to check?. I dont mind if it would 
shoot friends, as long as it shoots, that can be 
added later.. =)

Thanks,
Jim

Does BotFindEnemy() ever return anything other than NULL?  If not, that's your problem.  Are you using UTIL_GetTeam() to determine the player's team or are you using some other method?

Hi,

its the newest code,.Yes, im using the UTIL_GetTeam(). Seems like it only returns NULL
all the time, it should fire at friends too now, but it wont. Im all ears for suggestions. Should i try some other method for checking enemies? 

Yes now im convinced. I downloaded the precompiled dll file, sorry mate, but the bots dont fire either on that one. BUT, now i know why, its because CS, right?. i have the beta 7.1
so, based on the readme it isnt supported. Hmm.
Wierd. i shall try it on older cs like 6.0. 
Thanks! =D

Do they face you and not shoot?

Just start with the HPB alpha 3 findenemy function and add/strip bits as needed, testing to check it works.

Hi,

Well they collide at me and turn away. Like a wall or something. They dont face me, so they dont "see" me at all. Wierd, eh? :D

Ok here is how i fixed that problem:

Everywhere in bot_combat.cpp replace IN_ATTACK2;
with IN_ATTACK;
You also have to remove the ammo check, or else they still wont shoot !

Thanks! Im half way there, i´m just lost somewhere in the code.. Do you remember what did the ammo check code look like?. 

I suppose its on BotFireWeapon?. Sorry about being so helpless. =)

I re-wrote my weapon handling, its totally botman free'

This comes at the cost of my bot not knowing just how much ammo it has left. It may be different for, the secondary ammo message may be screwed or something.

Search for the word "ammo" in bot_combat.cpp its a programers word for AmmunitionYouTwit, a technology that can count the bullets in a gun.

If they dont face you then the most likely problem is that you have tried to add vip support into your findenemy function. I cocked mine up like that once so it spat out that no-body was an enemy of anyone. Except the VIP who then carried on to become a knife warrior....

Yep..

Okay heres what i did excactly. I modified the 
turning, then the IN_ATTACK2 to IN_ATTACK. And removed two ammo checkings for secondary and primary -> 2 long IF statements. Then i compiled.

All the bots Followed me for sometime. And all the bots followed the VIP too. When i go close to them, they point their guns towards the sky or start spinning around until i go away from them.
I just dont get it. Same thing happens on normal HL deathmatch too. This is easy for all of you, but why cant i just get it. Dunno. I did try to remove "dont target a friend" but it didnt make any difference.. Thanks to all of you.

Hello,

Well it seems i have the thing as you have. 
I think i should try to make the BeeBot from bot number 10. Is it a much harder to get 10th bot doing things on cs than Alpha 3?. Thanks for your time!

Yes, it is IMPOSSIBLE to use Bot Number 10 in Counter-Strike because they are each their own separate MOD and you can't combine two MODs together.

Woohoo! :D

It shoots now! Cool!. Man i feel myself so stupid,
but i just made clean install to CS and recompiled the bot and it does shoot now. 

Best regards,
Jim
p.s. To someone else who might face this problem,
try reinstalling cs and dont install another bots
since they dont like each other. =D
