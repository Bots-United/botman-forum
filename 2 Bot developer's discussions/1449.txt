Not that I know of, but my Bot Number 10 source code has an example of the player USEing a bot.  If you are playing in teamplay mode and you USE a bot on your team, it will follow you around like Barney does in the single player game.

a hacked workaroudn would be to write some function like CheckUse() that would simply check all players, and see if they were near you, facing you, and had their USE button pressed... and then call it from whatever THink() function is appropriate.
