MingW32 was running and compiling fine, but all I was doing was modifing weapons etc. (all i really wanted to do). Now i've come back to it and decided to play around more and do something greater... However my whole system has been screwy since I reformated (Counter-strike kills my net connection (even on LAN) and things like a MS-DOS window appearing for no damn reason at boot)

And when I run the MingW32.bat to get into the envionment i get the Error message "Too many parameters"

I should be getting MSVC++6 soon, (hopefully sometime this week) so this won't matter _too_ much, but i'd still like to know how to fix it, and what the hell is going on. :(

My guess is command.com has been messed up somewhere (the window appearing at boot suggests it's not completing something), which would involve another reformat (which i don't really want to do) to put right.

Well I really think you should re-install windows, or even reformat again! You bought Windows, you have to live with the consequences!!

You can remove the "@echo off" from the start of the MingW32.bat file to see which line is causing the error message.  Go back and compare that line to the original MingW32.bat file that comes with the mingsdk.zip file to find the problem.

Your probably getting that error because of an invalid path statement.
