what the heck is up with this I keep getting this error message...

Error E2316 bot_navigate.cpp 283: 'v' is not a member of 'bot_t' in function BotHeadTowardWaypoint(bot_t *)
*** 1 errors in Compile ***

I know its the line where i say IN_FORWARD but why is the error happening, i have other functions just like that and there is nothing wrong with them, im getting a sore head!


here is the code; thx to redfox for some things

code:


bool BotHeadTowardWaypoint( bot_t *pBot )
{  
 
 int i;

 edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;

 i = WaypointFindNearest(pEdict, REACHABLE_RANGE, pBot->bot_team); 

 if ( ( (waypoints[i].origin - pBot->v.origin).Length() )<BOTWPT_DIST)
 {
  Vector v_direction = waypoints[i].origin - pEdict->v.origin; 
  pEdict->v.button = IN_FORWARD;
 
 }
....
 else
  return FALSE;
}

Your problem has to do with the scope of the variable.  At the bottom of your post, you show a structure bot_t that has the variable you want, curr_waypoint_index.  To use that variable anywhere in your program, you're going to need a bot_t variable to use as a handle to the contents of the structure.

It's kind of hard to tell because most of the code is commented out, so depending on how you're expecting to use the current waypoint index, you should either be passing in a bot_t variable to your BotHeadTowardWaypoint function, or you should be creating one inside that function.  

Hope this helps!  Either way, look for documentation on "variable scope".  And don't get discouraged, this is one of the harder concepts of programming in C, especially when you're dealing with multiple files.

It's not the line with "IN_FORWARD" but this one which is causing the error:
if ( ( (waypoints[i].origin - pBot->v.origin).Length() )<BOTWPT_DIST)

"pBot->v.origin" doesn't exist, you have to use "pEdict->v.origin" instead.

P.S.: Botman had compiled a nice list of C++ tutorial pages in another thread some time ago, maybe these could help you with this kind of problems...
