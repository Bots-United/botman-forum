for a start its, 

code:

#include <iostream.h>


:)

and

code:

return 0; 



Cos the compiler will brag on about this function should be returning a value...

I'd advise you to learn the "printf" statements first instead of "cout", because cout isn't used in botmans template at all!

Anyway.

Hopefully this should work, make a ms dos batch file and put this into it.

code:


IF "%1"=="" GOTO uError
IF "%2"=="" GOTO uError

SET MING_DIR=%2

PATH=%MING_DIR%\bin;%PATH%
SET GCC_EXEC_PREFIX=%MING_DIR%\lib\gcc-lib\

REM Unremark this command below if you want to make a clean compile
REM del *.o
SET PATH=%MING_DIR%\EGCS-1.1.2\BIN;%PATH%;%MING_DIR%
REM Uncomment this command below if you are using a makefile (not needed for a program on one file only)
REM CALL %MING_DIR%\bin\make %1

CALL %MING_DIR%\bin\make %2
goto quit

:uerror
echo usage
echo compile.bat <program> <path of compiler>
echo e.g.
echo compile.bat hello.cpp C:\mingw32

:quit




Call it compile.bat
Then run it like

compile.bat <program> <path of compiler>

e.g.

compile.bat hello.cpp C:\mingw32

Hehe, a bit much :-/ Basically to compile with <b>Mingw32 just use the "make" program.</b>

I've put all that much up if you want to compile a bot really.

run notepad, copy and paste all the stuff into it I told you to put in it. Then save it as a ".bat" file i.e. with a .bat extension and you'll be able to run it.

oh and you'd better put 
code:

@echo off


 at the top of the bat file too before all the stuff so when u run it it doesnt keep showing the prompt command line.

for simple programs I'd recommend using turbo C/C++ or djgpp (practically the same as each other)
