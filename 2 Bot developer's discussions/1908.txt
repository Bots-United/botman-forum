I just started a new CS bot, and after hacking the CSBot project for a while, it turns out one of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of hearing.

I checked other open source bots, to see how they did it, but they all seem to 'cheat'. Instead of hearing sounds, they look at all visible objects and determine if they could have made a sound.

Doesn't HL somehow notify the DLLs if a sound is started? Or does the MOD start sounds? I should be able to intercept this, then...

Grateful for any help,
  Groby

Thanks for the (quick!) reply. (Do you watch the board 24/7? Amazing!)

I was afraid you'd say it was server side only. I was trying to take the lazy way out. I guess I'll just rip your UpdateSound routine and start from there.

Should my bot ever progress past the 'blatant clone' stage, I'll send you a copy in case you want to compare notes...

Bye,
 Robert

P.S.: I swear. I did NOT see the 'search' link. Must've been overexposure to flashbangs :-)
