What I really want to do is find the ground level (z co-ordinate) of the ground below an entity. This is for combat because when a bot shoots the enemy it shoot into the middle of you. If I could some how get where the ground is below an enemy origin... I could get the bots to shoot to the top of their head, or is there an easier way to do it? Cos in the mod im making a bot, some entities are really small, and they try to shoot snarks and headcrabs which are really small, they miss most of the time cos the shoot too low, hitting the ground.

I need to make a calculation like..

shoot target origin = enemy origin + (enemy z origin - ground z origin)

or maybe there is a simpler way like finding the size of the enemy may be easier...

IF you already have an edict you can use...

Vector aim_vector = pEdict->v.origin + pEdict->v.view_ofs;

This will give you the origin (center of the body) plus the view offset (difference between the origin and the eye position, center of head).  The view_ofs field will change depending on whether the player is crouched or not.
