How do you tell if a bot is zoomed or not?  Is there some variable?  This is counter-strike, and the sniper-guns in peticular

I tried to make the bot zoom 10 secs after the begining of the round, but its not working well.  So I'd like to know if there is a way of telling the current state.

There's a message SetFOV (msgID=91) - there u get the bot's current FOV - should be helpful ...

I used the message way, but you could also try pEdict->v.fov but i think it might be stored as a dot-product there.
