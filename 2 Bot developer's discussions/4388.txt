Just a quick quesiton, how do i distinguish between a weapon that is spawned on the (weapon_shotgun) and say a weapon being held by another player?

Currently i'm just experimenting with Bots that search then run for the shotgun, but they seem to identify my SHotgun (i'm holding) as valid as well, how do i stop this?

I've tried search, but couldn't find anything having said that i do remember reading something like it tho! :(

Weapons that are held by someone will have a non-NULL 'owner' field (look in the engine\progdefs.h file at the entvars_s structure).

If the owner is the same as the bot, then this bot is carrying this weapon (yes, when you search the world for weapon_xxx entities, you will find the ones that the bot is carrying even though they aren't visible).
