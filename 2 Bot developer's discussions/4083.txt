when we use the engine wrapangle function, it return value between 0 - 360.
my question, is 0 on the right side of the bot or in front of the bot?

On the Y angle (flat) 0 is in front of the bot
On the X angle (vertical) 0 is (I think) on TOP of the bot. This one to be confirmed.

You should think of it as a protractor around the Bot.

It depends on how you create an angle.  If you are talking about the view angles (pev->v_angle), the Y value corresponds to the Y axis in the map.  Moving such that Y increases and X stays the same (in the positive Y direction) is YAW=0.  Moving such that Y decreases and X stays the same (in the negative Y direction) is YAW=180 (or -180, they're the same thing).  Moving such that X is increasing and Y stays the same is YAW=90.

The x component of the view angles is the pitch.  This sets how far the player is leaning forwards or backwards.  A pitch of 0 is level horizontaly.  A pitch of 90 is looking straight up and a pitch of -90 is looking straight down.  The physics code (in pm_shared) limits your up and down angles to 89 degrees, so you can't actually reach 90 degrees pitch.
