Hi,

allright, now i got them recognizing hostages,
and taking them and only CT´s are able to take them, of course , but they still steals them but thats ok for now, and one slightly wierd problem.

First, the hostages are used like buttons, that was easier to make. Well, now they "press" the rescued invisible hostages too...

Your problem with the invisible hostages being used can be solved by using the same flag like in the weapon code. It's like this:            
if (pent->v.effects & EF_NODRAW)
{
// hostage hasn't respawned yet
  continue;
}

For Bots not using the same hostage over and over again I keep an Array of Entity Pointers. Everytime a Bot uses a Hostage I store the Pointer to this Entity in the Bots Hostages Array. So when a Bot wants to use a hostage, all Bots are checked if they have this specific hostage already in use. This Array of course is cleared at the start of a new round, if the bot is dead or he reached the rescue zone. That way the Bots only steal hostages from human players. This might be avoided by checking the oldorigin/origin of the hostage to see if it's in a moving state. I didn't really try this by now, just an idea. Hope this helps and btw. I'm such a moron to believe the FGD was an URL (feeling ashamed) :)

Hi,

Yes, i fix it like that!! I have one thing i need to solve with bots and hostages. I did change the code, so now Ts take the hostages as human shields. 

My bots use the hostages like buttons, that is kinda stupid behaviour i think, at least from ct bots. So, i want my ct bots take a hostage when ever they see one and not based on some "when i pressed use button" things, any possible hints???

What's the problem with using hostages like buttons? You can easily determine if a bot can see a hostage (->tracing). You can make the hostages follow the bot (->use-button). With CountFloyd's advice you can determine if a hostage is actually visible and already taken away by another CT.
What stops you from something like:

h = getVisibleAndFreeHostageInSight();
if (distance(h)>MAX_DISTANCE) approach(h);
else use(h);

...but you have to code this for yourself!

Sorry for leaving one line out: You've got to check if h is NULL before going on in line 2 :-)
