Dear All,

My nick is what I use at CS, so forgive me. From now on, I'll be FuckFace for you. When I started playing They all laughed at me, because I was so easy to target, now they fear this name.

Finally I got to program bots for CS, I think it is really a chalangin job, especially when it gets to real AI. I'm at the basic level, so I'm only writing so called BOT OPERATORS, which the BOT AI later can depend on.

The only functino what I really understands is the RUNPLAYERMOVE, which is very good at moving the bot, and make it look at the desired direction. I Can even make a jump, a shoot or duck.

Now what I absolutely do not know, is how the other thinks work. Like:

Select primary, secondary weapons...
Buy the weapons (buy message, menuitem....) I found that the CLIEN_COMMAN() did'n worked (for me at least).

So I would like to get a bit of an overall sight of how these things works...


Ge.
