Hi, Im new to the bot scene I guess. I have a pretty general question. 

Is the idea of writing a bot that doesnt use waypoints practical?

I guess that depends on your definition of "practical".

Is is possible?  Sure.  Is it more CPU intensive?  Sure.

I guess it's more of a personal preference.  Would you want to spend the time creating a waypoint file for a map that doesn't have waypoints or would you rather be able to run bots on any map with the restriction that you might not be able to run as many bots due to CPU loading?

Some bots automatically place waypoints as they explore the level (some Quake I bots did this).  Some bots can analyze the BSP data for the map to determine which areas are reachable, which are not, and how to get to the area that are reachable.  The bot for Quake III does this (although it's not a trivial task by any means).

I think it would be great if more people released source code showing how they would get a bot to automatically navigate in a map without waypoints.

I have an idea. A bot that follows teamates as a way to navigate and find enemies. No, this wouldn't work for DM games :-\ but there are plenty of DM bots out there. The bot could set a temp waypoint right behind where a friendly player is, goto that area and repeat. Mmmmm

I think some of the bots for CS started out without waypoints but then slowly incorporated them bcos its really not working out. Some of the players even coined a term "Playground effect" when these bots starts hanging out only around a certain area or never got "smart" enuff to get out of the spawn area.

If waypoints are really so detested, then u would probably have to come out with a heuristical analysis of the maps and come out with a set of A.I. logic "cells" for each map dynamically. You could probably do this during the start of the map. By doing that, u could probably cut down on the cpu usage quite a bit since the logic had already be pre-computed. Its just a matter of the bots usings the correct logic cells for the correct positions or situations. More logic cells -> more varied bot actions -> smarter bots -> more computation at startup -> more memory to hold logic cells -> more complex algorithm -> higher order calculations for stuff like path-finding etc.... Its a vicious process...

Its gets very tricky when u take into account multi-level maps. I thinks its really too difficult unless u got 24hrs all day and u do not have to work... Or u r doing it for a thesis or something.

HAve you considered using areas for navigation?
i.e. inside the area is defined as a place where the bot can be without hitting any walls/falling off stuff etc

Quake3 areana bots uses this method, and as far as I know the gladiator bot for quake 2 also does.

As to being practicle, it depends.
To have an automatic system for analysing a map takes some time, but the trade of is you'll never need to manually waypoint a map again.

How do I know it takes some time? http://www.foxbot.net :D
ok..sorry for the plug, but it atleast shows it is possible
still waits to be seen if I can pull it off completely
