hi all,

i'd like to test if an entity is a spectator or not... 
i'm coding a sort of "search, seek & destroy" bot but it always see the spectators as "playing players" because they have their FL_CLIENT flag on as they are clients...
The "UTIL_GetTeam" function cannot be used to determine this... how can i do that ?
thanks for help.

You mean if they are a bot? I would just make an observer flag in your bot struct and set it to true when the bot goes spectator and set it to false when the bot joins a team.

Spectators usually don't have any health.  Here's the code the HPB bot uses to detect players that are actually still in the game (not dead and not spectators)...
code:
bool IsAlive(edict_t *pEdict)
{
   return ((pEdict->v.deadflag == DEAD_NO) &&
           (pEdict->v.health > 0) &&
           !(pEdict->v.flags & FL_NOTARGET) &&
           (pEdict->v.takedamage != 0));
}

bool is_spectator = ((pEdict->v.flags & FL_SPECTATOR) == FL_SPECTATOR);

Works on most mods...

[edit] oops yeah that should be FL_SPECTATOR not observer 8)

The FL_SPECTATOR flag is also worth the test...
