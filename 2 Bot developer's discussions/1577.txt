Hey

Im trying to add ahl support to my mod, but ive got the usual problem: bots enter the game but doesnt get past the ahl"intro",motd and weapon selection :P

I know the bug is in the join code, and ive only used a small amount of time on it yet(1hour)...
but I should be able to have a working ahl bot within days...


this is how i tried to do it, please comment it..(i know its wrong)

code:

 else if (mod_id == AHL_DLL)
   {
      // handle ahl stuff here...

      if (pBot->start_action == MSG_AHL_WEAPON_SELECT)
      {
         pBot->start_action = MSG_AHL_IDLE;  // switch back to idle

         pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK; //welcome screen

         pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK; //motd

      bot_weapon = RANDOM_LONG(1, 5); //select random gun, NO knives

         // select the bot weapon...
         if (pBot->bot_weapon == 1)
            strcpy(c_wep, "1");
         else if (pBot->bot_weapon == 2)
            strcpy(c_wep, "2");
             else if (pBot->bot_weapon == 3)
            strcpy(c_wep, "3");
             else if (pBot->bot_weapon == 4)
            strcpy(c_wep, "4");
             else if (pBot->bot_weapon == 5)
            strcpy(c_wep, "5");
         else
            strcpy(c_wep, "5");

             FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", c_wep, NULL);

         return;
      }



cheers

Does AHL Beta 4 STILL have the old style text menus?  That's what the "menuselect" command is in there for.  I would have thought they'd have VGUI menus by now.

You've now a strong Bot competitor with AHL. Read that Rich Whitehouse ports his Jumbot over to it (they're telling it will be the 'official' Bot)

I'm also trying to get a bot in Action Half-life, but I can't get him to spawn. :(

I captured the message to equip yourself with a weapon but when I use that as a fakeclientcommand half-life crashes.

I use this code:

code:

else if(mod_id == AHL_DLL)
      {
            if(pBot->start_action == MSG_AHL_MOTD)
            {
                  pBot->start_action = MSG_AHL_IDLE;
                  
                  ALERT(at_console, "IN MOTD SCREEN!!!!!!!!\n");

                  FakeClientCommand4(pEdict, "equip", "-1", "-1", "-1");

                  pBot->not_started = 0;

                  return;
            }
      }



In bot_start.cpp.

I just can't get it to work.

My second question is: 
If I want to let the bot press enter with the first VGUI-menu how can I let him do that??

The menus dont react on IN_ATTACK.

Plz help.

I think that "FakeClientCommand4(pEdict, "equip", "-1", "-1", "-1"); " shouldn't have the '4' after 'FakeClientCommand'.

Does that help?

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Well actually no The FakeClientCommand4() function is a function which is made by myself to have 4 parameters, cause equip has 3 parameters.
I should have mensioned that :)

Nice try though.

hey jerry im wondering on the same thing..

but i dont think you can issue a "equip -1 -1 -1"
to get them past the motd screens, because the issue command is for select a pistol, a primary weapond and an item.....thats the three variables....

if you enter them in the console while youre in the motd screen you'll spawn , but the motdscreen will still be there...


so there has to be some other way ....

Well Heres an example of equip when I choose a desert eagle as weapon in deahtmatch it's:
equip 4 0 -17 (weird).

Does your half-life crashes when you use that command jorgen?? Or haven't you tried that yet??
Mine does.

I'll try some things to get rid of that motd screen, if I succeed I'll post it here so you can benefit from it to :)

Yep, hl sure crashes here too when i issue that commands...btw ive made a new fakeclientcommand4 just like you did :)

well, keep me updated on the work.....

It is very annoying to get a bot in action half-life. In DoD I also had troubles for quite some time spawning bots, but after a lot of trying I got them to spawn. I hope I can get them to spawn soon in action half-life then I can concentrate on the combat code which is much cooler then this :D

Hi there,
this is my first post, plz be patient...

to add the bots to Ahl you need to:
1. make a fake client command which takes
   4 parameters.
2. modify: Cmd_Argv() so it won`t return null
   as the 4th argument.
   just add:
   
   else if (argc == 3)
      {
         return &g_argv[256];
      }

before the else return null stuff and this will
solve the crashing problem (i think) and would enable adding bots to the game (!!!). it worked for me. note that you should change Cmd_Argv() again if you wanted a client command with more than 4 arguments.

now, have fun.

Hi again,

i managed to add the bots into the game,
but now there is a new problem:

the readme file that came with the template mentions WeaponList client message (no. 76)
that should help us add ahl weapons to the code,
however, i couldn`t find any message like this.
all i could find is some weapon precaching commands. 

could anyone help me figure out how to add ahl weapon support to the bot? please?

You'll have to change the line...

int debug_engine = 0;

...to...

int debug_engine = 1;

In the engine.cpp file and also remove the "#ifdef _DEBUG" and "#endif" in the pfnRegUserMsg() function in the engine.cpp file.

this is how i let my bot select weapons and equipment, spot any bugs ?

code:

bot_weapon = RANDOM_LONG(1, 5); //select random gun, NO knives

         // select a sceondary weapon
         if (pBot->bot_weapon == 1)
            strcpy(c_wep, "1");
         else if (pBot->bot_weapon == 2)
            strcpy(c_wep, "2");
             else if (pBot->bot_weapon == 3)
            strcpy(c_wep, "3");

            strcpy(c_wep, "5");
         else
            strcpy(c_wep, "5");

bot_unweapon = RANDOM_LONG(1, 9); //select random primary weapon, NO knives

         // select the bot weapon...
         if (pBot->bot_unweapon == 1)
            strcpy(c_wep2, "1");
         else if (pBot->bot_unweapon == 2)

I'm stuck with the same problem ariel. I got them to use the weapons they get in the beginning. Like the colt and deagle, etc. But I can't get them to reload, because the message 76 is all messed up with Action Half-life it isn't the same as with normal half-life or counter-strike. Guess I have some serious DEBUGGING to do :)

And has anyone got them to stunt already, cause I added a new IN_BUTTON in in_button.h, but the bot doesn't do anything with it. (I called it: IN_STUNT (1<<17), but it didn't work).

And can I detect a new button from the debug_engine??

Did you just abitrarily pick bit 17 and decide that it was used for stunts?

Take a look at the config.cfg file in your Action Half-Life folder to see what command the stunt key(s) are bound to.  Just send this command using FakeClientCommand() when you want to use them (this is the same thing that a real client would do).  These commands will show up in ClientCommand() if you turn on the debug_engine flag.

the bots now enter the game, select their weapons ok, and even sometimes shoots someone (me...), but when the round is over (100 pts reached), the map changes and the game crashes.

sometimes there is a message that goes something like:
"error: message_one or message_one_unreliable to null entity"

is it something with the start up code?

BTW:

why isnt the itoa() function (Integer To Ascii)
used in the bot weapon select?
the code could become shorter and can look like:

char c_weap[80];
int weap = RANDOM_LONG(1, 5);
itoa(weap,c_weap,10);

which i think looks more readable that alot of
if`s.

but thats my opinion... :)

well, for the ,movement part i just used the code that is already there, until i figure out how to make the bots move by myself.

for the shooting, since i dont know yet how to make the bots "understand" weapons, i just added the attack button pressing action to the BotThink function, which of course wrong thing to do.

there is still the crashing problem...

Yes I done it finally. I inserted all weapons, first I had to modify the currentweapon function in bot_client.cpp. They walk very nicely. They use all weapons :). They f*cking woop my ass :D.

Now I'll work on the stunts. And as you said Botman I tried to do it with a Fakeclientcommand like this: 

code:

pEdict->v.button |= IN_FORWARD;
FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "+stunt", NULL, NULL);



But it didn't work. Any other ideas???

Maybe I'll put the bot on a web-page then others can enjoy my bot too.

Bye.

what kind of game are you doing Ariel (deathmatch, Last man standing, etc.)??

Cause my bot don't crash if there is a mapchange or fraglimit being hit.

How does your bot_start look??

Mine is just simple but it works for deathmatch:

code:


if(pBot->start_action == MSG_AHL_MOTD)
            {
                  pBot->start_action = MSG_AHL_IDLE;
                  
                  ALERT(at_notice, "IN MOTD SCREEN!!!!!!!!\n");

                  int sec;
                  sec = RANDOM_LONG(1,5);

                  if(sec == 1)
                  {
                        FakeClientCommand4(pEdict, "equip", "1", "0", "-17");
                  }
                  else if(sec == 2)
                  {
                        FakeClientCommand4(pEdict, "equip", "2", "0", "-17");
                  }
                  else if(sec == 3)
                  {
                        FakeClientCommand4(pEdict, "equip", "3", "0", "-17");
                  }
                  else if(sec == 4)
                  {
                        FakeClientCommand4(pEdict, "equip", "4", "0", "-17");
                  }
                  else
                  {
                        FakeClientCommand4(pEdict, "equip", "5", "0", "-17");
                  }

                  pEdict->v.button = IN_JUMP;

                  pEdict->v.button = IN_JUMP;

                  pBot->not_started = 0;

                  return;
            }



Dont worry about the in_jump statements it was just for testing.

Youre right about that. I love getting fragged by my own bots makes me feel that I made a good bot ;D
