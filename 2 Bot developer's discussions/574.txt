Hi there. I plan to make a bot for CS. I have made the mp.dll file and put it in the correct directory. I start a lan game, type addbot but all the models turn out to be half-life models!!
WTF?! Help!!

Doooooh!  You can't put another mp.dll file in the Half-Life\cstrike\dlls folder because that's the name of the Counter-Strike DLL (it's "mp.dll" too).  You've just managed to wipe out your Counter-Strike installation!  I hope you've already got a Full Install version on your PC or you've got a LONG download waiting for you.

Name the DLL file something OTHER than mp.dll and copy it to the cstrike\dlls folder, then modify the cstrike\liblist.gam file to change the gamedll entry to your DLL instead of "mp.dll".

you can name youre dll anyway you like exept mp.dll.
then edit the ..\halflife\cstrike\liblist.gam 
and in it insted of mp.dll write the dll file that youve made and plased in ..\halflife\cstrike\dlls\

Yep, and it will keep on looking like HL if you don't get the original counterstrike mp.dll and copy it to the cstrike/dlls directory...
