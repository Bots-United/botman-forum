i would really like it if you can make it so that the bots actually miss some shots. currently they are way to godlike, when i encounter a medic....he kills me with every bullet, just wondering if u can make it like unreal tournament bots where they actually miss when shooting

Which bot are you using? If it's a good one it should have some config-files or -commands where you can define the aiming-skill. Put a lower skill and it won't kill you always :-)

Edit the bot.cfg file in the Half-Life\tfc folder and change the "botskill 2" to "botskill 4" or "botskill 5" and they will miss much more often.

If botskill 5 kicks your ass then maybe you should go back playing with crayons.

I think if you get desperate, you can try Botskill 0.
