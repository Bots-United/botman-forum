I don't use those in the HPB bot since it can't buy any additional weapons in CS.

You'll have to determine the new iID values by looking at the gmsgWeaponList client messages.

These are the new ID's:

#define CS_WEAPON_FIVESEVEN     11
#define CS_WEAPON_UMP45                  12
#define CS_WEAPON_SG550                  13

(They just replaced some of the formerly unknown weapons)
