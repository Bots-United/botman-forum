Hi everyone !

I'm currently in the process of doing my own Cs Bot derived from the HPB Bot. It's doing well so far (buys weapons,shoots human-like, Radio Messages etc.), but the bad thing about it is the waypoint system (as you can see by looking at Swat/Rambot, which both have an ugly movement system IMHO).
I changed the original waypoint system a bit so that I have
"crossings" where the bots can randomly decide where to go and normal waypoints where they stick to the next they see. Furthermore I check if the next waypoint is already covered by a bot so that they don't get stuck in each other. This works better than the original system but Android Alpha 2 still beats this. Does anybody know, how DaTa handles this in Android ? Since Android is pretty fast, I don't think he really examines the environment or goes through the BSP Trees.
One idea I had I'll explain here:
Instead of doing waypoints to steer the movement of the bots one could do so called "borderpoints". With that I mean enclosing zones with connected points where the bots are not allowed to move. That way (with additional normal waypoints maybe) you could do fully working wayzones. Also i.e. for planting the Bomb one could capture the bombzone Message and then let the bot decide by random where to go in this zone instead of using defined bombpoints. So what do you think (I hope it was explained clearly enough) ?

I read somewhere that android bot uses "zones"
some new waypoint system data has now..

That means you read the readme.txt coming with android where DaTa says he uses wayzones by now. Also when you play it for more than 2 minutes you'll notice how smart they move. I really had hopes someone could be more specific...

You'd do best by:
- using the way points to represent all accessible terrain (and use a lot of them, since that improves the quality of movement);
- separate thinking and way point attributes as much as possible (in other words, don't use too many flags to explicitly direct the bot instead of having the bot make explicit decisions himself about why, where and how to go somewhere);
- implement zones as collections of way points, and derive the zones upon load-time of the map (instead of hardwiring it during way point creation time).

Note that you can precompute a lot of information about connections between way points, reducing the amount of tracing that the AI needs to do to figure out how to go somewhere.

The border points you suggest are a solution to the problem of the bot not understanding the 'state of the game' and/or the bot being unable to reason about paths.
In time, it will be better to have the bot keep track of the game situation, and decide explicitly whether to go to one of the bomb zones, or to do other things. The bot then changes state to 'find bomb and defuse'.
The bot can pick the bomb zone at random, or exchange information within the team to cover multiple bomb zones.

I have been working with a route system for the waypoints.  I use predefined routes to get the bots to different areas of the map via the waypoint net.  It isn't very advanced, but I can get the bots to run alternate routes to the same location, or patrol a route, etc.  However, it does make the bots seem to play the game more.
I am not much of an AI programmer, so pathfinding they do is very rough, but it works.  I'm interested in any help I can get to improve it, most of my work has been directed at Team Fortress.
