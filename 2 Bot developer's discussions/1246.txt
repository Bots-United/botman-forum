I downloaded Admin mod for win32, the latest version - 2.10a ..

Is this possible:

// Team Fortress Classes Game .dll Listing File
// Load order is determined by file order.
game "Team Fortress"
url_info "www.teamfortressclassic.com"
url_dl ""
version "1.5"
size "37000000"
svonly "0"
cldll "0"
type "multiplayer_only"
nomodels "1"  // Don't show models in browser, since you don't pick them there anyway.
mpentity "info_tfdetect"
//gamedll "dlls\tfc.dll"
gamedll "dlls\HPB_bot.dll"
gamedll "dlls\admin.dll"
gamedll_linux "dlls/tfc_i386.so"

hehe.. I have a grave feeling though that it's not possible to load 2 dll's though.. I tried executing it from a seprate file and even that didn't wanna work, it just printed out the Half-Life version # and whatnot.. A developer would probably have to have the source for the Admin Mod and place that into their .dll to make it work, right?

No, Half-Life will not load 2 dlls, it will probably only load the first one that it finds in the liblist.gam file.

Alfred (Admin MOD author) was working on a way to get multiple DLLs to be loaded by the Admin MOD.  The Admin MOD would have a config file telling it which Add-On DLLs needed to be loaded and it would be responsible for calling the functions in the Add-On MODs and in the MOD DLL.

See this long winded thread about a similar issue trying to load more than one bot DLL...

Yep, i tried switching, but then of course it just loads Admin Mod and no bots..

gamedll "dlls\admin.dll"
gamedll "dlls\HPB_bot.dll"

Ok, Thanks botman !! 
I can't wait till Alfred get's that going.. :)
