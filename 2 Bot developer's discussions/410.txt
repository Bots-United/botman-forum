I prefer MingW32 since it's free, but I use Microsoft Visual C++ since I already have it.

MingW32 does a MUCH better job warning you about possible code problems, but it does take longer to build the object files and the code produced it not quite as efficient as the Microsoft compiler (plus the DLL is a little bit larger).
