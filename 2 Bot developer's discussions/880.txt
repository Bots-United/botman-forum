I say that the entire contents of CS should be crc'd and so on. Its a bit drastic but this will stop any and all cheats bar proxy cheats. And better network protocol encryption will sort that out.... 

For newbies...

CRC is a number that is practically unique to a file. Simplified (way way simplified) imagine adding up every number on a page and totaling it up. If someone changed a number the total wouldnt be right and you could spot a problem....

If this was done to every CS file (execept decals and cfgs) then most cheats would become useless and could be detected.

A database online could be built up too of the crc's of hacked files so it would be possible to detect the individual hacks that are being used.

The only drawback is that custom models wont work anymore, but if it stops cheating....

AS FOR THE CRC's themselves being hacked... Simply store them on an online database server that is updated constantly. This way no-one could get to them.

It would take about 45 seconds longer to connect but the cheating would be crushed to a small percentage. And then that could be wiped out.
(45 seconds spent sending and checking the crc's)

As a safeguard to someone hacking the dll to let them bypass crcing with the database the connection must be approved by the database machine before the server allows the player to connect after a successful file check.

Better protection of the network protocols in HL is essential too...

Erm...

You can still hack the crc check. just make a "bypasser" client.dll and send false info back.

Yeah but the CRC database server would still have to authenticate the client first. And if the crc check with the server was hacked so it was bypassed then they still wouldnt be able to connect.

Its quite a secure approach....
But nothing is indestructable.
