I know this would sound silly for many of you but is there a 'Navigation for Dummies' article out there?

I tried to read some thinks that where posted here but I just don`t have the time to sit on my a$$ and read them deeply... 

I do have some knowledge of graph theory though and I`m not comfortable using premade nav system for the Akimbot.

Thanks in advance...
