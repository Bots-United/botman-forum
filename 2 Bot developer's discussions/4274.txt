Hello..

I'm trying 2 make a "Anti Cheat" system. But could someone explaine how a basic cheat works like? "WallHack,AimBot etc"?

I'm working on a kind of Anti Cheat "Bot" system. The Whole idea is that it will be able to do alot of stuff.

Stuff i'm working on to add...

1. Anti Cheat system
2. Admin System (Like Admin mod)
3. IRC Admin system (where yoú can see a logo and write commands to the bot true IRC)
4. Stats system that write stats to a HTML (alt.PhP) file and save it on your Web Site
5. Bot (Add a working bot) 

6. HLTV Port!

-------------------------------------------------

1. Basic AntiCheat (ServerSide). Where it check for the basic Cheats.

2. To be able to do simple commands "like" Restartround,changelevel etc. Where people with acess (WonID or IP) can controll the server. It's also going to be able to read simple commands like (nextmap,timeleft,thetime) and also support vote_map (map).

3. This can be useful when you ex. Controll alot of servers. Each Server will have a IRC Bot that will send info about Killz,TK's, current map, map changes etc. You will be able to changemap true triggers (ex. !Map de_dust),(ex. !users), (ex. !kick #1 or RedLink)

4. Basic Stats support.

5. My old bot Project "American X bot", This is going to work as AdminMods "fun mode".

6. Don't know if this is posible but i would like to have a port "true" my Bot. So the server admin don't need to waste 2 spots at the server if he want's to use both CSSBC and HLTV.

-------------------------------------------------

I realy need help right now so if u've got the time just email me or write to my ICQ.

CSSBC is based on Botman's Bot Template #3.

-------------------------------------------------

If somebody got a idea for my "Project" plz tell me. If someone has some hint about any of the things i just wrote about, it would be of great help and i would of course include any help in the credit file =)

Sorry but, why are you making an anti-cheat program if you don't know how a basic cheat works?

It should be pretty simple to know how an aimbot works.. It calculates the aim vector from the player to an enemy, and sets it so the player looks exactly at an area on the enemy. That's it.

A wallhack works by making walls transparent. (??) Nothing great to know there. You cannot prevent this in your code because wallhack stuff is mainly done in the openGL dlls, all the current anti-cheat programs do is search for strange files that might be a wallhack.

I've already done a program to detect players with too good of an aim, and looking at players/shooting them through walls a lot. These are manually done but they can also catch out really good players and not just cheats.

"why are you making an anti-cheat program if you don't know how a basic cheat works?"

Of course i don't know how a cheat works, i've haven't even tested one. I'm a fast learner so'll wish me g00d luck =))

1. I hate cheates i've always done
2. I like to learn as much as posible about cheats and stuff like that so i can prevent it in my future games =)
3. I like to help the community
4. I like to do stuff my self so i later can see my self in the credit file =)))

Yea.. and anybody got any open source WallHack/AimBot or Anti AimBot/WallHack that i can look true?

Yea go dl the newest ogc. Its open source. Theres also a few easy ones so you can see how hooks are made. Its just like a server hook execpt it hooks to the client. Now there are proxys too plus stuff that looks for colors on your screen(these are easy because you check for the model size and if its the one for the green or red player you just kick him). Try ogc-lite its ogc without the cheats but with irc, winamp, and stuff like that. Heres it quoted:
QUOTE:

That's right, the OGC Hook under the heading of Utils instead of cheats. Why? Well because it doesn't contain any cheats!
This is the result of constant nagging from the masses, who wanted some of the hooks non-cheat features but didn't want a cheat on their machine. Nice idea, and its good to see the OGC guys listening. But it has two major flaws:

In order for it to work it must still 'hook' the Half-Life engine. This means that at some point (Update: this is now detected as a cheat), anti-cheat software will detect it as a cheat and ban your arse - even though you were doing nothing wrong. 
When you actually look at the Hook with all its cheats removed, there's not much left. All there is now is the new IRC plugin, its WinAmp features, the new chat console, some in-game stats and a clock.

Thx Gimli teh dwarf...

But do u got a link to OGC's website? i know one cheat site www.unkowncheats.com but i diden't find OGC's WebSite or any OpenSource Cheats there.

And about the thing with non-cheats.. That's a very effectiv way to destroy for the Anti cheats. If you get baned with one of those people can whine about getting cout without having cheats and then the anti cheaters haft to get another way to check for cheat wich maybe can be hard.




I'm working on some diffrent way's to check for cheats right now. 

QUOTE:

Yea and about WallHack, is it true that it just can make the first wall transparant? so if you make 2 walls one who is just normal wall and one with the same Texture just that it's "a fake" =) Won't it block the WH? I've seen in some mods for HL that can add things for the maps with a Additional file? Coulden't it be a great ide to test this?

With a fake wall i mean one you can see but you can walk true it.. If you add a layer with's dosen't take any space it will be counted as 2 walls and you can only see true the first wall. And it isen't solid so it donsen't change anything with the bullets going true?




This may seem to be a hard thing to do, but it's only needed to the standard maps like de_dust2,de_nuke,cs_italy etc..'





yea and i'm going to have a test server up with CSSBC installed on.. For testing. i'll give you the IP later ;)
