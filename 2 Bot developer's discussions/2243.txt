I'm currently making a "bookmark" function to my bot so that a player can move around on the map very fast. 

Its supposed to save the position and the (model- and viewing-) angles.

However, when I copy back the values, it doesn't not turn the player in the right direction - in fact it doesn't change the direction at all (though it moves the player to the right position).  

I figure it might be something I'm missing. This code is what I have now:

pEntity->v.origin = bookmarks.Positions [bm_nr];
pEntity->v.v_angle = bookmarks.V_Angles [bm_nr];
pEntity->v.angles = bookmarks.Angles [bm_nr];

Is there some kind of function I should call?

Try setting your ideal_yaw like this:
code:

pEntity->v.ideal_yaw = bookmarks.V_Angles[bm_nr];


Maybe that works, but I also ain't that good at angles :P.

i thought only the RunPlayerMove function could update the player information correctly?

Well. Maybe this is why it is not working.

IdealYaw did nothing.

Botman uses something which is close to what I need. I tried copying the code in, but it didn't change anything.

Maybe I should try RunPlayerMove....

pfnRunPlayerMove is to move a bot from the current position at a specified speed.

If you are trying to adjust a real player's position, pfnRunPlayerMove won't help you.

To change the location of a player set the pev->flags field so that they aren't touching the ground (&= ~FL_ONGROUND) then change the pev->origin field to what you want.  See the teleporter trigger code in the SDK to see how the teleporter moves a player.

If you want to also adjust the angles, you should set pev->fixangle to TRUE like this...

pev->v_angle = new_view_angles;
pev->angles = new_body_angles;
pev->fixangle = TRUE;

...the engine will set these angles for the player before the start of the next frame.
