I'm trying to be a little crazy with some bot mods. I would like to have the bots display a beam (like the waypoint beams) when shooting an enemy. As easy as it sounds I can not get it to work. What I did is made a function like WaypointDrawBeam called DrawTracer that I included in the BotShootAtEnemy function:

DrawTracer(pEdict, pEdict->v.origin + pEdict->v.view_ofs, pBot->pBotEnemy->v.origin, 30, 2, 255, 0, 0, 250, 5);

However I do not see any beam at all being displayed.

I created a test function that calls the DrawTracer function when I play and it works fine as a player bot not as a bot.

Any Ideas?

Thanks

It might be useful if you showed us the DrawTracer-function you wrote.
Also take a look how Botman draws the waypoints. He calls the WaypointDrawBeam function every second if I remember correctly (see WaypointThink)

Sorry for not being clear. The DrawTracer functions is like Botmans WaypointDrawBeam except for 2 differences:
   WRITE_BYTE( 5 ); // framerate
   WRITE_BYTE( 20 ); // life in 0.1's

in that case I think you should call the DrawTracer-function every 2 seconds.

The DrawTracer relies on messages it sends to the engine. One thing sent is the edict of the calling player. If I remember botman's code right, DrawTracer sends a MSG_ONE which means that only one player will see the trace: the one whose edict you pass to the function. That's why it works for you and not for the bot.
To change this, there are two possibilites:
1) Send a MSG_ALL (or something like this, the constants are explained in some header-file)
2) Search for your player edict and pass that to DrawTracer instead of the bot's edict.
