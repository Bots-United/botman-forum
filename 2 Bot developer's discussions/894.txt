I have made the hpb bot 1.0.1.6 compatible.

It loads counter-strike beta 5.2, but when i add a bot, theres is an error message :

MSG_ONE with no target entity

erm, any ideas? is it trying to send network messages to the bot????

Probably.  Make sure the bot's flags field in the edict_t structure has the FL_FAKECLIENT bit set.  You'll have to keep setting this since CS keeps clearing this bit.

I have tracked down the problem.


The UpdateClientInfo function isn't getting called, or it isn't in the 1.0.1.6 sdk

Therefor, the mod dll has no idea that the bot is a fake client...

Any ideas??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

UpdateClientInfo should be in the SDK 1.0 (and hence Half-Life version 1.0.1.6).  UpdateClientInfo will only be called when something on the client side changes (like the player model, or player name, etc.).  Since bots don't have a client they don't send anything to the server through UpdateClientInfo().

If you look in the HPB bot source code in the BotCreate() function you will see where I set some client side fields in the player's infobuffer.  These can be used to change "clientside" settings (like not using the lefthanded model, etc.)

When i make the bot join a standard half-life game, there is the same error....
It appers that the mod dll doesn't even know that the client is fake... strange...

Oh, by the way, i was talking about UpdateClientData() :-)

I was looking at UpdateClientInfo() , and it didn't appear t have enough parameters...
