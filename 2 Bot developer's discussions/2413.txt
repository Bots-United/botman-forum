For some unknown reason, when my bots join the game, they join the right team, but are put on the team "Unassigned".  They are still "on" the team but my gamerules use frags to determin teamscore and when they are on "Unassigned" it doesn't count.  Does anyone have a clue?  Thanks.

Did you try rebuilding all? Because a few days ago I changed a lot and changed from release to debug (in MSVC++) and they wouldn't join anymore. It took me a day too fix it by rebuilding all :(.

when you have many bots on one team and none of the others team limitations might kick in (at least for counter-strike). Try setting

mp_limitteams 0
mp_autoteambalance 0

on your server when having many bots on one team.


I don't know if this fixes your problem, but I remember this "Unassigned" thing before I had my server configured right.

I've rebuilt all several times, so this isn't the problem.  Also, this isn't CS or anything and the CVARs mp_limitteams and mp_autoteambalance aren't in my mod.  One of the teams has a one player limit, and the other has no player limit.  Also when I add a bot, then kick them, then do add and the bots picks that name, it joins the right team, and not "Unassigned".  So if I add 31 bots and then kick them all THEN make them rejoin they join the teams right.  It's very confusing..

maybe try these:

- if it's round based, wait for the next round and see if they join then
- do not add bots too quick, but wait some time

I've seen this problem with NNBot too. Although the server vars were set correctly, some bots didn't really join. I guess there is something in botmans template that seems promising when changed, but sometimes causes these problems..
