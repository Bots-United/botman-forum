What causes the bots to do an 'abnormal' jump wherein they jump for a very very short time and land back to the ground instantly.
I saw this happening in one of the early versions of Realbot, I just wanna know what causes this because it happens to my bot and I can't find the problem...
PLEASE HELP!!!!

Check to see if the IN_JUMP button is pressed for more that one frame, If not you should make some variable like f_jump_time (or something).

that way you will force your bot to use the jump button for more human times (like 0.7 secs. etc.).
