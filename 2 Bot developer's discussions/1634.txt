The Akimbot is out and loose!!!, actualy, it

(address post in couple of hours)

PS:
Botman, is the distribution of the original files
from HPB_bot (i.e. the TXT and BAT files, some modified) ok with you?, i'm to lazy to write new ones and you will get the credit for them...

Sure, you can redistribute the .cfg and .txt files from the HPB bot if you want to as long as you don't list my e-mail address as the contact for your bot.  You can provide the URL of my web site if you want, but I'd rather not be getting e-mail from people asking how to get the bot to work in Action Half-Life.

I still get quite a few e-mails each week from people asking how to get the PODbot, or TEAMbot, or Android bot woking on their machines.  I usually just politely explain to people that I didn't create these bots and don't know specifics about how to solve problems with them and that they will need to e-mail the author of the bot instead.

hey botman just take the time out to make a email filter if its at all possible so that you can quickly tag any set words or phrases such as dod day of defeat or ahl , action half life action hl a half life so on and so forth i think there is a program that does this free on the net at www.thefreesite.com

well, it was under our noses all the time:

look in in_buttons.h and look for:

#define IN_ALT1 .....

that is the (many, many 4 letter words) stunt button, so:

pEdict->v.button|=IN_ALT1;
pEdict->v.button|=IN_FORWARD;

and magic.

so... can i get a credit, plz ;p

btw, Akimbot will have teamplay, healing and 
so on in a couple of days. wait for v0.2.

You also might want to change your profile and add a WWW link so people will know where you web site is.

i think my last post got lost...(?!?!)
anyway, thanks for the offer but since the akimbot is still under development, and it will
take some time (i`m pretty stuck), i`ll wait with the website thing for at least a week or so.

in the mean time, check v0.6
