I've so far managed to avoid FakeClientCommand and my dmz bot is coming along nicely but to make itslef fly the bot needs to issues a flytoggle command. i cant get this to work. I've tried lots of different ways. Also i cant get kill to work (i wanted to get bots to suicide if a bug was detected, is there another way)

To kill a player...

//(pEdict = edict_t*)

ClientKill(pEdict);


For the Flytoggle thing, you should really ask the MOD author how to do this, perhaps there is a boolean value you can find with an offset given from the MOD Author to use in pEdict->pvPrivateData that you can set the flytoggle value without issuing client commands and also check if the player is flying this way.

well i asked him about powerups he said +pup. he told me that +beam is IN_ALT1 but says powerup is +pup so im guessing some of this is done as client commands. akimbot can fly so it must be possible. another email to the dmz author...

Email @ bluesy (Akimbot author), I'm sure he'll explain you.
