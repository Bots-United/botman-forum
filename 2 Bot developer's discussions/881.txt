I am working on a mod called World War 3...  So far, i have adapted your bot to work great with my mod.  But, I believe i must access player information in order to get a really good skill adaptation system going.  See if a bot is seriously kicking ass, i might want to check the bots frags and compare them to players frags and ajust the bots skill acordingly...

If you are building the bot into your mod then I advise you look at the bot 10 source code....

There is also the RhoBot sourcecode (it no longer works with HL 1101) and TheFatals advanced bot frame.

Hope that helps.

Yeah, I had the bot 10 in my mod but i wanted to use the hpb_bot waypoint system so i found a pre template version of HPB_bot on my computer( i had downloaded it before the template version was the only src available), and modified it to link to my mods hl.dll instead of valve's hl.dll and changed the other directory stuff and before i knew it i had HPB_bot, waypoints and all, working on ww3(my mod).  But like I said, I now need to access CBasePlayer and there is no way to do that, to my knoledge, using a dll linking bot.

-So the problem at hand is I need to make any modifications needed to incorperate HPB into the hl.dsw workspace...

It would be far easier to merge the waypoint.h and waypoint.cpp files into the Bot Number 10 source than to try to convert the HPB bot source to normal Half-Life SDK format.
