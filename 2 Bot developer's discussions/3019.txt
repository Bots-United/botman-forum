The HPB bot template source code comes with a Makefile for the Borland 5.5 command line compiler.  See the ReadMe.txt that comes with my SDK 2.2 patches for details on getting the Borland compiler set up properly.

Compiling is the hardest part for me, the code isn't hard to understand.

Things are OFTEN simple to understand.
When it comes to writing, then it's another deal.
I tell you :D
