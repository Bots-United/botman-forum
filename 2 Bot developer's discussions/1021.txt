Where can I set the latency for the bots.  Is the latency command "fakelag" server side or client side controlled? 
I tried a FakeClientCommand(pBot->pEdict, "fakelag", "10", NULL); 
as a test to try and set the bots latency to 10, but it doesnt change.  How can this be done? 
TIA

oh well, thanx for the reply.  it'd be a nice feature, but it appears that it's one built into the client dll.  I agree that the server does not introduce "true" or "real" lag, but then again fakelag is not "true" or "real" lag and should be applicable to the bots, but since there is no actual fakelag routine for fakeclients (being that its most likely in the client.dll, that would be the more likely answer.
Botman, do you think there might be an api somewhere in the hlds.exe or dlls that u could apply a fakelag to the fakeclients?  The reason i find this curious is because why would the server assign lag of 5?  That kind of says to me that it's a "default" setting given to fakeclients.  Being that they are running within the server itself, their lag should really be 0.  So even if the actual fakelag code is in the client.dll which would not be running while the server is running, maybe there is an edict_t variable somewhere controlling the fakeclients lag setting.
Oh well, just a rambling mind ;)  What are your thoughts on this?

I think the lag for the bots is actually zero.  I think Valve has some code like this somewhere in the Half-Life engine...

if (client_lag < 5)  // check for ridiculously small lag times...
   display_lag = 5;
else
   display_lag = client_lag;

Botman, i get 0 lag in lan games, so it would be like this :

code:

if (IsFakeClient = TRUE) // more "realistic" 
  display_lag = 5
else
  display_lag = calculatelag;


Also, i think you added an extra colon in before the 'else' bit

I think pikachu is hitting closer to home.  It doesn't make sense to see if the lag was small then make it 5, imho, because it's a waste of cycle time when u can just display the actual lag number.
Fun stuff! =)
I'm convinced it has to be a variable that's accessible somewhere in the sdk.  If someone wanted to write routines in a game (for whatever reason u can think of) based on a persons lag, it should possible.  The hunt is on!
