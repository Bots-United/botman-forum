Sorry guys, I'm gonna have to leave the forums now, my dad doesn't like me spending so much time/money on the forums (he's paying teh phone bill and won't let me have an unmetered thing).

I may come back to ask questions but I won't be able to answer any TEAMbot questions on the forum. If you want to ask me any questions about TEAMbot or anything just mail me: ali@elitegamer.fsnet.co.uk

Bye! :(

I hear the public libraries have Internet. Or maybe that was a myth?
