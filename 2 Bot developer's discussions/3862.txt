Just a idea ;)

It's so many people making one bot for em self, why coulden't 3,4 - 6 people get togheter and make the "Best HL bot ever"? With a team of programmers the j0bb would get alot easier.

A bot isen't a easy thing to do. at least not a good one.

Open Source is one way to solve it but it isen't as effetive as it would be to have a team who could speake and plane the stuff... 

Ain't i right?

I seriously doubt that this would be very effective over inet. meetings in real life would be necessary I guess, at least to coordinate work and discuss principal ideas. ( experience from the amsterdam bot developer meeting :D )
and RL meeting have to be planned, they are expensive, ...

This has been discussed many times before here and on other forums.

It's difficult for bot developers to all work together on one combined bot because the bot developers don't all agree on which way certain situations and problems should be handled.

You can't easily divide up different parts of bot development and have 5 or 6 people working on them separately because most of these components are interconnected and it's difficult to design one without the other (for example, trying to develop a combat system without having information about hearing or vision, etc.).

Also, if you've ever worked on a small project with 5 or 6 developers that are spread out across several different timezones or countries, you would know how difficult it is to coordinate the efforts of these developers so that they are all moving in the same direction and all have knowledge about what the others are doing.

For many projects, it is helpful to have several different people working on several different pieces at the same time, but this is more like a case where "too many cooks spoil the broth".

That's true...

But for now i think that every body should try to realese there Source Code at least help people with there own experiance.

There is no reason why not to realese the source code. There is no money involded and i dont think any lame asses will steal your code. I've been working on a bot my self and i'm going to start on a new one for "NS" and maybe "CS".

what if you did this: 1 on AI development and 1 on movement.
2 developers... I might be teaming up with another developer on mine but I don't know yet.
We will possibly argue all evening long about mod support :D

That is one problem, the other is features. believe me, if you are teamed up at a standard mod you will see this easily. But if you can make it work, the bot's quality will increase.

to give you an extreme scenario: imagine all bot developers in here (this forum included botman) going together to make one bot...
It would be a mess unless you pick one leader who makes decisions but that can again ruin the project since people can get annoyed with the leader and leave.

How come that big developers keep together? well the money they get. It has becomed a job not a fun project.

Also that's not that easy. Some parts of the AI have to be done before the others.
For example, you can't work efficiently on the navigation if the sensing part is not finished. Nor can you work on the reflexes, nor can you work on the cognitive AI.
And you can't work on a decision maker if the navigation isn't complete.
And you can't work on MOD-specific behaviour if the basic MOD support isn't implemented.
And so on...

It will be difficult, annoying for people like me because I like to go at my own pace and I don't get on easily with people with eact same knowledge of programming etc (i.e. having to explain things over and over in text) which is difficult to avoid.
