I was wanting to play Jailbreak and only few would play via internet. My connection also was a big deal of bu77sh1t. So are there any Jailbreak 0.95 OPENSOURCE bot? I mean it's so easy coz the makers already made the source code and I'm dying to play it with many players... NEEEED FEEEEEEDBAAAAAACK
