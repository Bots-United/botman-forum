hello, i have find a very strange problem
with allocation of memory.

with XP or 98
i can do all of this

p = (PATH *)malloc(sizeof(PATH));
p = new PATH;
p = (PATH*)GlobalAlloc(GMEM_FIXED,sizeof(PATH));


but some person who use winME ( lastest version with update)

p = (PATH *)malloc(sizeof(PATH));
p = new PATH;

can't do this standard function of allocation
without having error ( i dont say that p=0 but the calling of the function crash the hl process ).

i must use this,

p = (PATH*)GlobalAlloc(GMEM_FIXED,sizeof(PATH));


if any body know this problem and his solution
a me very intrested. because i don't want to use GlobalAlloc function.

How much RAM does the guy have ?
How much RAM does your program pretends for in total ?
Is he running Half-Life under a special environment ? (using the -heapsize command line option, for example)
