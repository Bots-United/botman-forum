I used the standard SDK and the HPB bot template version to make a dll file for a TFC bot im making. but when i try to load it, all i get is the TFC map and all things are missing except the objects from HL:DM. what did i do wrong? also my gun is the hand gund from HL:DM and when i shoot it no noise or bullet just a mark on the wall.

any help would be great, thx.

Here's a copy of the reply that I e-mail to you...

To create a bot for TFC you need to do this...

1) Download MingW32.exe from my site and install it using C:\ as the install
dir.

2) Download the HPB bot source template zip file and unzip it to the
directory of your choice (let's assume you use C:\HPB_bot).  Make SURE you
preserve the directory structure when unzipping (WinZip calls this "Use
folder names" when extracting).

3) Start an MS-DOS window and run the MingW32.bat file
(C:\MingW32\mingw32.bat)

4) Change to the HPB bot dlls directory (cd C:\HPB_bot\dlls)

5) Rename makefile_ming to makefile (rename makefile_ming makefile)

6) Run make to build the HPB_bot.dll file (make)

7) Copy HPB_bot.dll to C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\tfc\dlls (or whatever disk and
directory you have installed Half-Life in).

8) Modify the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\tfc\liblist.gam file just like the HPB bot
has (change the gamedll entry to use HPB_bot.dll instead of tfc.dll)

9) Run Half-Life and select TFC as the custom game and create a game.

10) Use "addbot" to add a bot.
