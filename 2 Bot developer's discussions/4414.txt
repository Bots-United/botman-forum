Ok, I wanted to know if there is a plugin for metemod so I can use quad, pent, invis specials in tfc.. I've seen the quad on hunted servers and in avi's on concmaps and rocket jump maps that normally dont have quad.. I've searched for that hunted quad plugin but couldnt find it anywhere, I know the quad model has to be precached cause I've tryed to load it many times with sv_cheats on a long time ago, I found out it only works on the maps that have the quad set to precache so I was thinking is there anyway to load this in the monster plugin since it has a precach option? or precach the model and use sv_cheats to get the special since I know there is a command to get it..

Possibly they were using my Stripper2 metamod plugin or using ripent from Zoner's Half-Life Tools to add quad damage entities into the map.

Download my Stripper2 plugin and search through some of the messages in the Metamod section of this forum for Stripper2 .cfg files for TFC.
