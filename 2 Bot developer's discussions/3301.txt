Where do I tell a dedicated server not to run in "secure" mode, when ever I try to debug CS within HLDS for my bot and when I connect, it kicks me saying I have cheats on my PC (I don't hehe) Its because I'm debugging (on the server) and connected using the same ip.

Add "-insecure" to the command line.
