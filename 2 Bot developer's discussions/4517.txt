Hallo Bot-developers

I'am developing a bot that use some genetic stuff and I have to run the game a lot of times before I have a good result.So it would be nice if it is possible to switch the graphics off, and run CS bots faster than real time.
Anybody who know if it possible? 

Regards
Martin

Yes, run a dedicated server (hlds.exe in your Half-Life directory).

Use www.google.com to search for "half-life dedicated server tutorial" or something similar to find links on doing this.

No, I think he meant "accelerating time". I believe he's toying with some sort of genetic algorithm that needs a lot of time before cross-matching the best patterns.

I think you can't make the server time go faster than the "normal" time, can you ?

No, you can't really speed up time, but you can make the bots go as fast as you want them to (well, within some limits) by just changing their velocity.

Don't make them move any faster than about 2000 units per second or the physics and collision code will start having some really weird problems.

OK- I have to be patient then.

I'll try to run my bots on the dedicated server so i dont't have to see them running around, that an improvement. 8-)
