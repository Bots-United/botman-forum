When I try to do tracelines into the skybox, the vecEndPos and associated things seem to point to the trace hitting the BACK of the skybox, rather than the first part of sky encountered.

This is a real problem, as I need to be able to find the lowest point of the sky (ie. where it starts, and where the player's movement is clipped). Does anyone know how to get the traceline to stop at the sky, or any other method?
