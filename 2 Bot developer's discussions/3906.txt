Bot Number 10 is meant to be used if you are developing your own MOD and wish to provide a bot for that MOD.

The Bot Number 10 source code is meant to be integrated into the SDK source code and WILL NOT work as a plugin type bot (i.e. a bot that sits between the engine and the MOD, like the HPB bot does).  If you want a plugin type bot, use the HPB bot source code.  If you want to develop your own MOD and include a bot, use the Bot Number 10 source code.
