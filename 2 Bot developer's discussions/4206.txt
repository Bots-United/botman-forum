Are you triggering on some sort of "round start" message to indicate that the bots should start buying weapons?  If so, then prehaps the round start message was sent before the bots were able to join the server, hence they missed it.

The variable is set to false in BotSpawnInit to indicate that the bot have to buy weapon.
I have the same problem then i use the command sv_restartround 1.

Then a round is finish i catch the message in the function "pfnFindEntityByString" in engine.cpp, and after that all the bots buy weapon.

btw. is there anybody who know a little nice map(Bomb/defuse) for testing bot in CounterStrike ?

Just make one like 2 rooms with a defuse and spawns. Then compile your done.
