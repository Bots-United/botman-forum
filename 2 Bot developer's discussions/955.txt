the bot im working on doesnt fire any weapons, the weapons are setup above. basically the combat.cpp is unchanged except for the mod, it uses valve settings, any clues as to whats preventing them from firing? I'm using FakeClientCommand to simulate keypress to join the game, the mod is Wasteland HL, post your insight here.
