I have a little function, which tests, if a func_breakable entity blocks the way. Everywere it's ok ( p.ex. de_nuke ... ), but in cs_estate, there is is wooden window behind the house. The bots go there and shoot all ammo @ it. U see the decals, but it cannot be destroyed by the bots !!!?? Why ?

Could be a couple of things. The trigger_only flag could be set. Or the streangth could be 999999999
heh

Hope this helps

But the bots "see" that's a func_breakable item and any human player can destroy it with 2-3 shots from a pistol ...
