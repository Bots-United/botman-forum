Well the title speaks for its self. version 1 of my bots nearly done, but I can't figure out how to tell if a bot has picked up a flag or not?

Oh, just as a reference I've found a bug that you should probably know about. The waypointroutefromto function somtimes returns a spurious value (65536 etc) so anyone using the HPB_Bot templete should be aware of this. Did you know botman? If not I hope it helps.
To solve it I just checked that the return value was less than the number of waypoints that exist.

Anyway if someone knows the answer to this I may have my bot up by next week (it'll use botmans waypoint files). If I can be asked to write a webpage as well :)

Hi,

You get status icon message when you pick up the flag.

You have to be careful, as it seems there are 3 different types of status icon messages, each with a different(!!) number and type of parameters.

I just check to see who the owner of the flag is (that's the guy that's carrying it) like so...
code:
   pent = NULL;

   while ((pent = UTIL_FindEntityByClassname( pent, "item_tfgoal" )) != NULL)
   {
      if (pent->v.owner == pEdict)  // is this bot carrying the item?
      {
         // we are carrying the flag/card/ball

         bot_has_flag = TRUE;

         break;  // break out of while loop
      }
      else if (FInViewCone( &pent->v.origin, pEdict ) &&  // can bot see it?
               FVisible( pent->v.origin, pEdict))
      {
         // check if the flag has an owner...
         if (pent->v.owner != NULL)
         {
            // get the team for the owner of the flag...
            int player_team = UTIL_GetTeam(pent->v.owner);

            // attack if not our team and not allies team...
            if ((player_team != team) &&
                !(team_allies[team] & (1<<player_team)))
            {
               // kill the man with the flag!
               pBot->pBotEnemy = pent->v.owner;

               pBot->waypoint_goal = -1;  // forget the goal (if there is one)

               return TRUE;
            }
         }

         // otherwise head for the flag...

         // ADD YOUR CODE HEAR TO HEAD TOWARD FLAG

      }
   }

Oh, one last question, what are the vertual key values that I need to set for the bot to shout for medic, throw a grenade, drop flag and drop excess ammo???

Not that important, but I would like to know.
Did try using the values from the tf_defs.h
but TF_MEDIC_HELPME wouldn't work.. Its probably just me doing somthing wrong somewhere :) (that happens a lot)
Anyway thanks.

You can let the bot use the FakeClientCommand: (Observe),

code:

edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;

 // Fake Command to make the bots yell for help!
 FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "saveme", NULL, NULL);

 // Make something for grenade throwing! using FakeClientCommand
 



That's all there is to it.  (Hope this helps!)
:)_

Haven't tried grenade throwing yet in mine maybe some-one else can help with that.

Grenades:
to start 1:
FakeClientCommand("+gren1", "101");
to throw 1:
FakeClientCommand("-gren1", "101");

to start 2:
FakeClientCommand("+gren2", "102");
to throw 2:
FakeClientCommand("-gren2", "102");

"drop" is excess ammo i think

don't know about the flag.
