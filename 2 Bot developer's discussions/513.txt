how do i associate flags with waypoints such as. if i wanted to make a waypoint for hwguys only. would i have to use the #define W_FL_HWGUY flag and the hw guys would look for these flags right? or do i have to give the bots commands to find these types of waypoints?

You would do it just the way you described.  Define a new W_FL_WHATEVER bit in the waypoint.h file and add a command so that you can set that bit in the waypoint flags field (like "waypoint hwguy" or something).  Then when you are looking for the goal waypoint of an HWguy just scan through all the waypoints trying to find one with the W_FL_WHATEVER bit set.

ok, i was just curious if i had to also program the HWGUY for instance so he knows that he is suppose to find that type of waypoint. but thanks for clearing that up for me.
