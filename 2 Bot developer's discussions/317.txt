After removing no less than 28 different ping-pong bugs in my path finding I have done it..

This version uses floyds algorthym to get about from destination to destination.

Plants the bomb too..

I just gotta re-add all my old code for version 3.2 

(I started again with the algorythym to get that working first and worked on features after)

Housemuzic, you need to seriously go blow! CS happens to be the most popular and successful mod for not only half-life, but of any game ever! Us CS players don't diss TFC, and you have no right to do the same to CS! Get a grip dude, seriosuly.

You're right about that Auxois!

The hours, days, months, even years the CS team spend on making CS, well thats a thing i raise my hat for.. Its amazing how just a MOD can get people so excited,angry at it, addicted to it and the thing that they got attention from High up meaning Valve & Sierra Online, is amazing not ALL get it.

The time they chose to make CS was perfect!. Im not on theirs side or any side, this is a political opinion. =). I´ve seen some people hate their success, while others envy them and the rest just are stunned: like me. All mods have equal changes to get big, they just need to have "that" something.

i just wanna throw in my two cents here, i dont play cs because i cant afford a computer that will run it, i am barely struggling to be a tfc player that is on a pent 133 without a vid card.  I know a vid card would improve my performance but that is  a whole different discussion.  I think taht the reason that some of the tfc players are getting mad at the cs players is because botman made a bot that works for all of them, he didnt discriminate on any mod, then about 4 or five coders took his source code and spun off on counterstrike bots, taking the counterstrike is better than tfc and not including a tfc counterpart to their bot.  It ticks off some tfc players that in the forum for the only tfc bot taht people go on and on about their mighter than you are counterstrike bots when they could go and do it somewhere else.
I know i probably rambled on there for a bit and my points might not be as clear as i wanted to make them but both sides should back off
