It depends on which SDK you downloaded.  The Full SDK contains hl.dsw which is used to build the hl.dll file.  This includes single player support as well as multiplayer deathmatch support.  If you downloaded the Standard SDK you will have the mp.dsw which is used to build the mp.dll file.  The mp.dll file will only support multiplayer deathmatch games.

If you download the Valve Full SDK (about 74 megabytes) it will contain hl.dsw in the Sourcecode\dlls folder.  If you download the Valve Standard SDK (about 16 megabytes) it will contain mp.dsw in the Sourcecode\dlls folder.  You can download the SDKs from here...

http://www.valvesoftware.com/hlsdk.htm

If you get the SDK from anywhere else, it may or may not have all the files.

As I stated above, hl.dsw will build hl.dll which is required for single player MODs.  If you only want to build multiplayer MODs then you only need to download the Standard SDK and use mp.dsw to build the mp.dll file.
