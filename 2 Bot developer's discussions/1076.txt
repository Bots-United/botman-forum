My bots walk realy stange, sometimes they walk very slow (also falling slow). The rest of the time they walk the normal speed. I thought it had to do with the msec code, but I never changed that.

Can anyone help me???

Sounds like it's to do with pfnRunPlayerMove - check that u haven't changed any pfnRunPlayerMove commands!!

I haven't changed anything in the pfnRunPlayerMove function.
The bot can't be shot in the leg because there where no opponents and he also fals slow.

I found the problem. The msecnum value is getting changed by something. I don't know what I have searched all my code.
I fixed the problem by using this code:

if (num != pBot->msecnum)
    pBot->msecnum = num;

This is placed before the pfnRunPlayerMove code.
Num is filled in after the msec code.

Sounds like you've got something overwritting the value in memory, possibly and array going out of bounds.
