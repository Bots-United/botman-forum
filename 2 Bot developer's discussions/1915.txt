Hi

Just want to ask...How does a bot see the enemy? And when he sees the enemy, does he know what is the enemy size relative to his view? For instance if the enemy is hiding, only a small portion of the body can be viewed, but the bot still knows that the enemy is there.

And how can we calculate this amount of size that the bot  can only see without obstruction.

Thanks

There are several factors to take in to account when an enemy is spotted.

1) How far away is the enemy? (which will determine the "size" based on what a human would see as perspective).

2) How brightly lit or poorly lit is the area where the enemy is standing?  This will effect how well the bot can see the enemy.

3) How much of the enemy is visible from the bot's position?  (i.e. is the enemy partially hidden behind a crate, wall or other obstacle)

4) Is the enemy directly in front of the bot or is the enemy being seen using peripheral vision? (you can use the dot product of 2 vectors to determine whether an enemy is directly in front of or to the side of a bot.)

5) Is the enemy in motion or are they motionless?  (humans tend to notice things that are in motion easier than things that are motionless, sort of like the T-rex in Jurassic Park)

There are probably a few other factors that I left out as well (I'm sure William can add more to this discussion).

The HPB bot currently doesn't use distance, light, motion or take peripheral vision into account when detecting an enemy.  The HPB bot uses a 90 degree field of view (FOV), which is the same as the default player's field of view, to decide whether an enemy is visible or not.

There have been previous discussions in this forum about detecting light levels to reduce the likelyhood of a bot spotting someone standing in the dark.  Use the "Search" feature to look for "light" or "levels" to find these.
