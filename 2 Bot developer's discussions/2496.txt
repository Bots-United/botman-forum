1. How to make team specific waypoints like flag capture waypoints or bomb spots?
2. How to let the HPB_bot.dll read out of cfg-files {if you know what I mean with this senseless sentence)?

well, you'd setup a few params/arguments on your command(s), for like team, and objective..

then you'd make that command add a waypoint with some objective flags set

then if you bot is around a waypoint with that flag make it do what it needs

Well, the method being used for the bot.cfg is just executing a command on the server "exec bot.cfg", if you want to setup a scripting style config setup, i suggest checking out cmdlib.c of the hlsdk..

1. 

 Set up FLAGS in waypoint.h, see all the thingies at the start of waypoint.h ? They are are the flags ;D Make up your own, give it your own name and give it the next number in the bit mask so it doesn't conflict with others.

Edit your WAYPOINT MENU, go into dll.cpp and edit your menu and add it by going down into client command and showing it etc.

2.

look at ProcessBotCfgFile() in dll.cpp
