Check it out!  I'm making a Half-Life Winamp plugin called "Singing Walter"...

You can select 4 different heads for the scientist (Walter) or you can select Barney (my hero!).  It moves it's mouth along with the song that's playing! ;D

Very Nice !!

I don't know if you're already doing this but it doesn't seem so: since Walter should react to the vocals why not use the center channel (which is usually used for singing) instead of the sum of all channel output ?

I didn't know Winamp had a center channel.  From the vis header file it looked like there's only the 2 channel (left and right).

Yes there is a center channel Botman I've seen in some plugin's that when you hear singing the plugin's would react to that...  I'm looking at your plugin source to see if I can do this :-)

From what I can infer from the Winamp forum, the center channel has to do with what sound card you use (and selecting DirectSound in the preferences).  Here's some discussions about listening only to voice (or center channel)...

This might be a misunderstanding here. I'm not talking about how balanced the music is or about your soundcard but about the waveforms themselves. When a song is mixed in the studio they usually put the vocal lines into the center so if you remove the samples of the center line in a waveform you can turn any piece of music into instrumental (almost, because there's still some reverb/echoing most of the time). Here's code which removes the center channel from a 16bit Stereo Waveform (from Dr.Dobb's Journal):
code:

for(int i=0; i<numSamples; i+=2)
{
 short int s = *(buffer+i);
 *(buffer+i) -= *(buffer+i+1);
 *(buffer+i+1) -= s;
}

Winamp also has some sample code in the DSP sdk that's supposed to remove the vocals, but it sucks pretty bad.

Maybe I'll give this a shot in the visualization plug-in to see if it does any better synching the lips up with the vocals on the song.  Don't hold your breath though.
