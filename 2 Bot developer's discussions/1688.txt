Is it possible to determine a BOT's current position in some form of coordinates position?

pEdict->v.origin contains the current position for the bots and for most other HL-entities.

pBot->pEdict->v.origin contains a 3d vector of the position. 

BTW : It's always useful to take a look into the HL SDK!

Thanks very much for that, I didn't realise this information would be in the SDK, I am quite new so I will look at that in the future before asking these types of questions.

One other thing, why do developers opt for waypoints over developing AI to create unpredictable navigation?

ok, it hasn't to be the whole sdk for the start, but at least the files from the sdk in the hpb bot template are useful ... like edict.h and progdefs.h
