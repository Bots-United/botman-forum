Yeah my bot works for a change but in cs_assault the CT bots go straight for the dark corner in alley and starts to jerk off or something like. Even though it's fun to watch, can anyone tell me on how to make them stop or not to jerk off often?

Did you add in any waypoint navigation code?  They'll just randomly wander around with out it and will very often get into places that they can't get out of very easily.

Nope! No navigation points.

the problem is, that the black 'walls' are not detectable by the tracelines. Any ways to figure this one out?

is it a special entity or something? like the fences? func_wall?!?

U could also just check if the bot hasn't moved very far in the last frame (and it has a high f_move_speed), then just make it turn around or whatever u want to do... maybe u should try and reverse engineer the bsp and see what it is (I don't know how to do this, so I can't help u), at least your doing it for a good cause!!

U could also go to cs.net and ask ppl on the mapping forum, they would probably know!

Well, if you know anything about mapping, the "black wall" is simply a CLIP brush. However, I don't know how to detect that. Obviously, the functions that check for walls blocking the bot don't take into consideration any CLIP brushes. Is there a way too?
