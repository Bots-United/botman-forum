Is there anyway you can make the bots able to play maps in TFC like Shutdown and shutdown2? if you haven't played them they are the maps with the lazers protecting the flag so you have to hit a switch to shut them off then you can get the flag for like 60 seconds. there must be some way to make the bots play good on that map because I really like to play it and wish bots.

At one point I was going to create a "sequence tag" for waypoints where you could tag a waypoint as #1, or #2, or #3, etc.  The bots would have to visit these waypoints in this order (and press buttons near by, etc.).  This would allow bots to open doors by pressing buttons then going through the door, or in your case pressing a button to turn off a laser before going for the flag.

I never found the time to implement this feature and probably never will.  There just weren't that many maps where a sequence of events was really required (other than maps where you have to capture the flags in sequence, but these had other problems too where bases that were captured could become "uncaptured" by the opposing team).

So to answer your question, no there isn't a way to get the bots to behave correctly.  You can TRY to get them to do what you want by controlling the paths between waypoints and forcing them go to near the button FIRST and then have those waypoints be the only ones with paths that lead to the flag, but there's no guarantee that the bots will press the button when they reach the first waypoint.
