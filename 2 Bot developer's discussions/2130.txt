Subject: Lets create one big 'theory book' for HL bots?!?

Hey all, maybe you guys think i'm nuts. But i think this is a good idea.

The past few months i've been coding, and trying to solve some theories for a 'smarter' behaviour for bots. I started writing my own document. 

Like i've found a way to do cover, which most of the times work in battles. I'm not sure if i will release the theory. But, then i thought about this.

I have got so many information from here, i think i need to give some information back :)

So, i thought lets combine all ideas for any mod and put them in one document. If some newbie coder comes here, you refer him to 'the' document and he will read and also understand how the Half-Life engine works! Without coding!

My current document covers theories about:
- taking cover
- where to look at when 'navigating'
- where to look at when 'taking cover' or 'camping' in a 'smart' way.. 

the theories use waypoints and taking cover don't. (Although there are 2 ways to do it, WITH and without wpts).

I know that william made great sketches and PDF files for explaining some of these things in his code. And they are really worth it to download it and read them. I did that too. However, if we could simplify these ideas... 

Maybe its just a waste of time, but i think its a pitty to leave all theories scattered and we might get some things done we never thought it could be done?

One attempt to do something like this (but slightly more ambitious and commercial - you get paid for writing) is the upcoming AI Wisdom book (similar in style to the Game Programming Gems series), but entirely devoted to AI.

See: www.aiwisdom.comAI Wisdom website, and the www.aiwisdom.com/selectedarticles.htmlcontents in particular.

Valve (Lars Liden) might be covering "cover" in "Strategic and Tactical Reasoning with Waypoints" while I'll be doing some 20 pages on a number of squad AI issues.

[commercial break]
If you have the money to spend (~ $70), you also might want check out the new Game Programming Gems II. I've posted the AI contents on my www.cgf-ai.comhome page.
[end of commercial break]

Yeah I agree...I did learn a few things from all this bot coding. I would really like to share it to others.

Btw how did u implement cover without waypoints? Did u use tracelines?

Uhmm... 

What I wanted to say was:
- good idea, but bad timing (you might have made it into the AI Wisdom book)
- what do you want us to do? Convince you to publish your ideas? Tell you to keep them for yourself? Start trading ideas?
- why not publish part of you bot design on your web-site. You'll be amazed how people appreciate it, and you'll get a handful of good responses from AI designers from everywhere.

btw, I do have a dutch explanation laying around of the terrain reasoning, but (as you know) the RealGamer magazine died just when it was supposed to publish it :(

I think it would be a lot of work collecting information together but it would be a nice resource to have to give other people ideas about ways to implement some behaviors.

There's tons on research on navigation and quite a bit of research on flocking (grouping) behavior (see my "Links" page for some examples).  It might be worthwhile to create a web page with links to various navigation articles similar to what's done on other game AI sites, but with more of a focus on bot (robot) navigation in static (or mostly static) environments.

Just the other day I saw the news on botepidemic about the FrikBot X update.  I read the page about the waypoints and waypoint tags and found a few things that I hadn't thought of before.

Discussing these types of ideas in public helps people to see alternatives to what they are thinking about doing and helps to point out potential problems or workarounds to problems that they may have.

I would think it would be a little difficult to come up with some method of interactively creating this type of document over the Internet unless you were able to use a forum or guestbook type application that would allow people to read what had been previously posted and to post their own comments.  You might want the ability for people to rank comments or suggestions on a 1 to 10 scale (one vote per IP address) to allow people to gauge which comments are more "worthwhile" than other comments.

I have no real motivation. I think, its good to have some 'central' resourcement. Also, it should be free, and easy to use. It should also be easy to addapt to any kind of engine. However, mainly concentrated on HL.

I don't try to gain anything. Maybe the only thing i try to 'gain' is that people will get interested. Or, (because most people are already) give those people an url where some theories are explained in a 'simple' language. 

To answer the question on how i did covering:
I realized, that 80% of the time, we humans always look 'aside'. I mean, even if you look 'ahead' you always look 'aside'. So, what i did is simple. I let a bot look left and right (where he is facing, not the body!) , if the bot can reach one of those positions, i will trace a line from that vector to the enemy. If that line gets blocked, then its 'good' for cover. The bot will trace once more to the left and right. And then will randomly choose one of the positions. It seems to work on heights too, but not as good as 'face to face' on the same heights. However, i think the results are at the moment quite well for my first attempt.

I have written this theory with some pictures in a document. I will release it as soon as i release my bot.

Indeed simple and elegant. To add something just about as simple:

In case the bot is positioned significantly higher (at a high pitch angle towards the target), you should change the strategy to moving back, rather than sideways.
If I'm on a high roof, looking at a threat low down in the streets, stepping away from the edge (and ducking) gives me cover in most of the cases. Moving sideways typically doesn't help (and might be dangerous for other reasons).

thanks, first i really was sceptical about the idea, although on paper it should work :)

stepping back is indeed very good for significant heights. I will implement this immidiatly, as it shouldnt be that hard now, the cover code works as it shoulds, all i have to do now is return a vector where the best cover is to find and it will override the waypoint navigation function and let the bot take cover...

i also was pondering about a stealth mode like bots. I mean, they all rush as crazy. Even if they look back or to dangerous spots, it would make more sence if they knew if an area is dangerous and try to 'sneak' around. I'm doing some thinking about this now...

just finished another theory about that grenade handling. Although i wrote it in my own words, you (William) gave me the inspiration. 

I still think we should do something like this. I will run it as a second project as soon as i have released my bot.

I think I would even prefer a variety of "essays" over one big document: different people came up with different solutions for the same problem, they should present it as they deem best i.e. on their websites. However, it's very important that you've got links to all sites offering this HL-bot-related information. I'm sure botman would add these things to his Links section.
Stefan, I've been thinking about setting up a Tech-section on my website as well where I can explain how different aspects of my bot are working. It would be very interesting if every bot had something like that... The CGF website (which was of great help to me) is an example of how it could look like if we put sufficient effort in!

excactly tobias. Thats what i've been doing right now. I'm writing down how i tried to solve my 'problems' for the bots. I even put ideas there that didnt make it in code (atleast not in my code), but are decent enough to give it a try (and heavily depends ofcourse how your bot is coded etc).

I'm collecting links here and there, requires me to visit a lot of pages. But its not a 24h job :) its for fun, so i keep it slow and keep it FUN :)

The document may contain as many sollutions to an idea as one can think of. I mean, i put 2 ideas of taking cover, but i bet there are more ways to do this. So, actually i try to collect these ideas and such and put them in one document.
