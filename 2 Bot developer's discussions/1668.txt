I remember seeing a posting about increasing a bot's health on the forums months ago, when I tried serching, it isn't there! Could someone post the snippet again? Thanks.

All you need to do is loop through all the bots and change the pEdict->v.health to a larger value.

Thanks! Why did you remove the "use" function from your HPB? It was in 7 until 10...

Because I wanted the HPB bot to be as close as possible to playing on the Internet against other human players.  You can "USE" other human players to get them to follow you, so I didn't keep it in the HPB bot.
