Come on guys. I know most of you have the Standard SDK 2.0 downloaded, all I need is the sourcecode from it.

Can anyone email it to me at angry_madnow@yahoo.com? I would really appreciate it alot.

I have a 28.8k modem (on the comp I want to have the sourcecode on) and its impossible to d/l a file that big. It ussaully would take three-four hours for something like that, AND ONLY FOR 800kb OF SOURCECODE!!!!!!!!!!!




PPPPLLLLEEEEEAAAAASSSSSEEEEE????????!!!!!!!!

If you looked for one second longer you'd see that you can also download only the sourcecode :)
I'll give you the link:

Damnit again! Read better! I know he has only the sourcecode on his site, what I need is the SOURCECODE FROM THE STANDARD SDK, HE IS GIVING THE SOURCECODE FROM THE FULL/PRO SDK.
