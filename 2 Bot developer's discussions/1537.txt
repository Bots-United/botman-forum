--------------------------------------------------
I'm already thinking two days about this problem and now i thought about posting it here, although this might look like a newbie question, but i don't get the solution.

my bot.cfg contains this lines:

addbot 2 2 default
addbot 1 2 maeh

and the log file says:
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:25: "Colonel Holger[JOE]<1><0><>" joined team "CT"
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:25: World triggered "Game_Commencing"
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:25: Server cvar "sv_friction" = "4.000000"
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:25: "maeh<2><0><>" entered the game
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:25: "maeh<2><0><>" joined team "TERRORIST"
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:25: "maeh<2><0><TERRORIST>" triggered "Spawned_With_The_Bomb"
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:29: "(1)Colonel Holger[JOE]<3><0><>" entered the game
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:29: "(1)Colonel Holger[JOE]<3><0><>" joined team "CT"
L 04/16/2001 - 22:36:30: World triggered "Round_Start"

Where does this second 'colonel' come from ??? max_bots is -1 for sure and the 3rd bots name is always the one like the first bot's. i looked for loops and so on in the bot.cfg processing function, but havn't found one ... 

Does anybody has an idea ?

is that one of murphy's laws, too ???? 

some minutes after posting i found that the reason is some kind of 'respawn' - code in startframe ... sorry for asking this stupid question, but probably it helps someone with the same problem

ah ah ah ah! 
@$ - AS
3.1415 - Pi

Sure! this isn't very obvious! and I think that ASPIRIN is wellknown enough but your way of writing gives headaches more than it actually cures them!
blah! doesn't matter... ihave paracetamol at home!

1.2 question about the bot.cfg?

addbot syntax :
 
addbot team model name type prefweapon
(addbot [1/2/5] [1/2/3/4] name [agg/nor/def] weapon - for weapon see information on bot_names.txt a bit lower)

example : addbot 2 2 @$3.1415rin nor weapon_mp5navy

Tried it^
And i crashed not once but twice. 
On map change over's did you intend them to join 1 by 1 slow like they do? I can run and plant the bomb and win the first round before they ever get me. 
Ok, so how i got it working was to put this in the bot.cfg,
addbot 5 ( 12 or 14 times )
About the botmenu, is it when i'm close to a waypoint that that is the only time it pops up? I just discovered that this New version, i never seen it last version. 
psssst, Keep up the Good Work! :D

aha ... i put that command 5 times in my bot.cfg, started cstrike and nothing crashed ??!!

It's always difficult to trac such errors, which do only occurr on other pcs ... ok, I'll take a look at the code and see if i can add some "if(pointer)" there ... what else should it be ?!

About the bot menu ... it's opened with 'botmenu' command from the console, or u can bind it as well to a key.

BTW : I don't think botman is amused when abusing his forum for reporting bugs of my bot. on my new page I'll have a forum, but right now, please add it to my Guestbook or write me an email, thx

about the botmenu :

some time ago i found out, that my botmenu is only workin with the numbers 1-5. Now i took a look at other bot's menus and they used all slots. Is that probably a problem of my configuration or is that a general problem with botman's menu code ? I just copied the code from #3 and changed the text and the structure, but i can see no changes which could lead to the neglectance of 6-0 ... anybody know why ?

Are you passing the correct bits for "slots" in the call to UTIL_ShowMenu()?  For example to enable keys 1-5, 8 and 9 would be...

UTIL_ShowMenu(pEdict, 0x19F, -1, FALSE, menu);

re: a$3.1415rin = aspirin, I think maybe aspirin uses such a complex nick so he can gauge the intelligence of the people he talks to ;)

lol ... then u don't seem to be intelligent, because u can neither copy a name with copy and paste nor copying a name the traditional way, read and write ;)
