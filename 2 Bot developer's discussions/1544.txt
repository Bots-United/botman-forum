Hi, I'm trying to make bots for another mod but I don't know what are those values for.
The magicians only use their weapon when their are far of the ennemy... I hate them!!

bot_weapon_select_t tfc_weapon_select[] = {
   {WEAPON_DAGUE, "weapon_dague", 5, 0.0, 50.0, 0.0, 0.0,
    100, TRUE, 100, 0, 0, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, 0.0, 0.0},

And those too...

bot_fire_delay_t tfc_fire_delay[] = {
{WEAPON_DAGUE,0.0, {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}, {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0},0.0, {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}, {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}},

Thanx, excuse my english plz...

is there a way for me to find the right values for each weapon in botman's weapon system? 

tried implementing the jackhammer in holywars but... the bots still wont fire... and firing randomly sucks though...

typedef struct 
{ 
  int iId;  // the weapon ID value 
  char  weapon_name[64];  // name of the weapon when selecting it 
  int   skill_level;   // bot skill must be less than or equal to this value 
  float primary_min_distance;   // 0 = no minimum 
  float primary_max_distance;   // 9999 = no maximum

The only way is figuring it out the values for each weapon: The jackhammer is a closecombat weapon so you should set e.g. primary_min_distance to 0 and primary_max_distance to maybe 100. Since there are only 5 different weapons in HW it isn't really much work implementing the weapon system for it.

Also the jackhammer is best used by holding the fire button down all the time.  Look at how the egon gun in Half-Life deathmatch is handled for an example of a weapon where the fire button is held down while firing.
