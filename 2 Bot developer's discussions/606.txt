O.K. then, I've got my site hosted with ValveWord (http://www.valveworld.com/hostilet) and there you will be able to find info on our teams mod "Hostile Takeover" which will feature a bot made by yours truly and with the help of you guys+gals... Thou shalt recieve credit and Botman (we're not worthy!)

ANNNYYYYWAYYYY I need some linux help, so if you are interested in being part of "Fragmentation Dev" (No Money is dished out :) ) avanti to the site :)

Also, as I was on about the msec stuff, I'll post mysolution there before too long.
