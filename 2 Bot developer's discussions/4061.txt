Okay, don't think  i have worked this entire thing out. But i think there is a need of a topic on this one. 

Currently i have downloaded steam, the latest CS and such and they work fine.. without bots. I took a quick look at the steam directory, containing in the steamcache the half-life and counter-strike folder. Both are directories actin like a total new game (i assume that).

There is no liblist.gam however, there is no linking / directing to a dll in the way i used to. I am not a guru on this so i ask you guys if you have any clue on how to make bots work with steam. I am pretty concerned about this, because if it aint gonna work, then cs 1.6 will be the latest version  bots will work with. I understood the final version of cs 1.6 will be downloadable but 1.7 will be steam only. If that is the case, i have a problem, hence the entire bot community has a problem on this one.

What ? wait...
Are you sure the Steam "cache" file isn't some sort of big zip file, or whatever, kinda what PAK files were in Half-Life ? ie, supporting to be replaced by their extracted content ?
Don't bot work AT ALL? I don't have Steam, I can't check, how is it between listen servers and dedicated servers ? Does Steam still provide a hlds.exe ?
Please, clarify the statement "bots don't work with Steam", there's quite an emergency here !

There's a thread on NukeBox about getting the PODbot to work with Steam.

Let me go digging around to see if I can find it...

EDIT: Maybe it wasn't on NukeBox, maybe it was on the old Steam support forum (which unfortunetly has been flushed and replaced by a new forum for Steam 2.0 testing).   Hmmmmm.

HA!  You can't even search the forums at www.steampowered.com for "bot" because search words have to be at least 4 characters long (hmmm, maybe "bots" will work!).

Yep, "bots" works fine.  Not much there though!

EDIT: Hmmmm, searching for "metamod" seems to yield some results as well.

He doesn't see our point though. The terrible news are here : Steam turns your computer into a gaming <b>TERMINAL</b>, no more, no less. Bots and addons stand a chance to work only on dedicated, broadband Steam servers.

No chance of running bots nor addons for the Steam customer on his listen server. Not even MODs, unless they are "Steam-powered", at Valve's discretion, such as Counter-Strike.

The customers aren't in control of their local servers anymore. Listen servers don't exist anymore.

If you want my opinion, it's the death of the Half-Life platform, and the modding community. Only will stand a chance those who have means and bandwidth enough to host or hire a Steam gaming server.

I read somewhere Valve wanted to get rid of cheaters. I just see the medication is worse than the disease.

I feel like I need <b>SEVERE</b> encouragements and cheerup, to hold on a 2 year long work on a doomed platform. My work is portable, yes, but show me a worthy platform which I should give a go for. None has the modding community Half-Life has. None has that ease of development and support, whatever little it can seem. None has such great and various styles of gameplay in such many brilliant MODs. I feel like those guys in Apollo XIII, "Houston, we have a problem". I would be pleased to know what you bot coders think.

Riot, or suicide?

Some guy in the POD-Bot forum described how he got them to work with the dedicated server:

Besides, I don't understand this excitement because there's not much new about Steams working from what I've seen. Just because Steam is holding its (Beta! Remember it's Beta!) game content in a compressed folder doesn't mean the final will look like that. Though I'm convinced CS will quickly die when 1.7 can only be bought.

Did you believe Half-Life would still rock in 5 years ? Time to move on...

Like CF said, Steam is in beta right now.  Also, the beta version of Steam will ALWAYS download ALL content from the Steam server everytime a client wants to play the game.  This was done deliberately by Valve so that they could stress test the Steam servers.

Steam doesn't have anything to do with anti-cheating.  Steam is a content delivery system.  Steam is meant to be a way for people to automatically update any files that are too old when they want to play a game.  This means you don't have to download and install patches when they are released, it will happen automatically when you try to play the game (the Steam server will look at the timestamp of all your files for a MOD and see if any of them are older than the copies on the Steam server, if so, you get new copies of these, then you connect to the game server).

Valve has stated that they will continue to support MOD development once the final version of Steam is released (i.e. you'll still be able to run Natural Selection, even though it's not a Steamable MOD).  This means that the final version of steam will HAVE to have some sort of liblist.gam file (it might not be called that exact filename though) in order to know what DLL to load for that MOD.

I wouldn't get all worked up about something that hasn't reached a final form yet.  If the final version of Steam comes out and won't allow anyone to muck around with Valve MODs, then bots will just no longer be available for those MODs.  Bots should still work with non-Valve MODs the same way they always have.

Wait until the final version of Steam is released and see what it is and is not capable of.  If it won't support plugins for Valve MODs, then so be it.  Move on to another MOD, or move on to another engine.

CF, i think its not the point to move on to another engine. I mean, we could move or even start on other engines longer ago. But we did not, and why didnt we? i think you can fill in that answer yourself aswell.

The point is, Valve & Steam are killing this entire bot community, i am convinced that without the effort of HPB Bot and its template, the entire community would be way more dead as it is now. 

I don't see the point of using steam actually. As a normal customer you buy a game, then you have to redownload the entire game again? I had to download over 400 MB. Note, that i am lucky with my broadband connection but many people don't have this, so what do they have to do? I have no words for this kind of action , using Steam and HL in one. Argh.


Oh btw, Steam is beta, yes, CS is beta, true. BUT that does not mean it won't get out of beta stage! Beta means to me, the concept is ready, the idea is done, the bugs need to be squised and you aint gonna change the entire concept. I tried earlier versions of Steam aswell and then i was able to use bots btw.

This whole steam crap will kill everything, and i am mad about that.

My answer would be that HL is the only game I know where you've got access to a lot of the game internals, even exposing their AI to the public. Furthermore Botman did all of the basic work and wrote decent documentation, I doubt there would be so many Bots - if any at all - without him (POD-Bot wouldn't exist, I'm certain). I didn't code that Bot to get popular or something, it's a nice side-effect but I already knew before that I'm the coolest guy under this sun :)
Valve didn't care that much about Bots, as you know it wasn't even possible in early versions. To me HL is a great testbed for working on general AI stuff which is an immensely huge and rewarding field I didn't tackle before. I wouldn't have a problem switching over to let's say MOHAA once there's a decent SDK, to me it's the learning process of making decent AI and figuring out what's working and what's not.
Also this excitement about Steam comes a bit late imho. For example I've been using Steam about 1 1/2 year ago, yes it's really that old ! Back then they already introduced their "games on demand" business model. You've got to understand Valve as a company which is there to make money. Why do you think they provided people with this SDK in first place ? Because they are "good" people ? From a commercial point of view releasing a SDK gives the consumer more value without adding more content to the game. It's 2-folded like most things. Consumers can tweak and modify stuff they like/dislike, perhaps even creating real MODs which creates the feeling they got much out of that game which is nice PR. In addition the company producing the game (Valve) sees who's talented and who's not, making the recruiting process incredibly cheap and easy. I most probably left out some more reasons here. So believing Valve did this because they are altruistic sounds naive (sp?) to me. I'm actually worried more about CS 1.7 not being free for download anymore, there will be a retail version only. So far nobody knows for sure if it will be Steam only or if it can be bought in retail stores as well. I believe it's too early to rely on all people having broadband, since this will exclude most markets except the US. However Valve knows this too so there probably will still be a CS 1.7 on the shelves. I dislike this development myself but you can't turn back time, can you ? What I mean is if you're pissed now you should have been miffed a lot earlier. Besides this opens up new technological challenges as well because imho the steam technology can be compared a lot to the well known safedisc copy protection. It would just take some time until smart people figure out how to hook Steam and "unwrap" the data streamed to your HD. I know for sure that the holy Valve VAC Anti-Cheat Module was circumvented as well, if there's a lock it always can be opened. :)
Music on demand failed and so will games on demand. Again, this is just my personal opinion.

72.5 percent of Half-Life users have cable modems, DSL, or T1 access to the internet...

I'm not that sure that Valve is very concerned about people that don't have broadband access.

They don't need to be concerned if they are gaining enough money with direct distribution which would be otherwise lost on publishers. As you said...so be it.

CF, you gave me the best answer i could get ;)

I'm not really pissed, because i know i will still play CS 1.6 (when ever the official comes out) for a long time without steam whenever possible, and i think people will even continue playing with bots when possible. I feel now , i have 2 versions of CS. The 'good' one (with bots) and the 'bad' one (without bots, using steam). The technology behind Steam sounds great, but it aint that new. Besides, i agree on 'games on demand', it probably wont work.

If MOHAA comes with a good SDK, so you can code your bots for it, i will consider looking into that kind of stuff aswell. However, HL will always be (as you mentioned before) a great testing platform...  and it runs sooooo well on my low end laptop ;)
