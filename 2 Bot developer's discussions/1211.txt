*ahem!* My first question is there such a language called Dark BASIC? My friend told me that at school that there is such a language.
And my friend also told me that MSVC++6.5 came out! Is that true??

Yes, there is a language called DarkBasic. Its like the basic language but for 3D and it uses DirectX. Its really easy to learn, but so far its downfall is its speed. Can get slow on even fast computers. vistit http://www.darkbasic.com

As for the MSVC++ 6.5 i have no idea!

Is there like a big difference between C++ and Visual C++?

C++ is the language.  Visual C++ is the compiler/editor/debugger environment.  If you learn C++ you can write console applications in Visual C++ without really having to know how to use Visual C++ (other than knowing how to create a project, add files to a project, and build a project).  If you want to take full advantage of Visual C++, you should learn how to use the integrated help tools, the powerful search capabilities, the powerful debugging tools and some of the other nice features like the C++ object browser tool.  You don't HAVE to learn any of these Visual C++ tools to be able to write C++ applications.

Hey thanks Botman! Now I know.. but could (if you can) check if this sample code is right?

code:
/// Sample test

#include <iostream.h>

void main()
{
      cout << "This is a test"
              "I hope I don't get any "
              "Errors ";
}

--------------------------------------------------
It is correct.
but I think you want a space more after "test"
or your output will be:
"This is a testI hope I don't get any Errors"
and not:
"This is a test I hope I don't get any Errors"

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Actually it's not quite correct, but it is close.

You can use this...
code:
#include <iostream.h>

void main()
{
   cout << "This is a test.  I hope I don't get any Errors " << endl;
}

...or this...
code:
#include <iostream.h>

void main()
{
   cout << "This is a test" <<
           "I hope I don't get any " <<
           "Errors " << endl;
}

Notice that I added the "<< endl" at then end of your output to a newline at the end of the output and flush the output stream.  Also if you have strings on separate lines you need "<<" between each of these strings (or concatenate them into one string as I did in the first example).

Actually, the original code is correct, since C and C++ concatenate multiple adjacent strings into a single string:

"a" "a" really is interpreted as "aa".

However, Dark_Claw is better off switching to the newer version of STL (almost compliant with the C++ standard), also supported in MSVC6:

code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

What advantages can I have using, 

code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

Using 
code:

#include <iostream>
using std;


instead of:
code:

#include <iostream.h>



has you use the newest version of the STL libraries. For MSVC, the newer versions have a less cumbersome syntax for constructors. Besides, you have more options to solve any nameclashes with, for example, MFC (not that you'll use MFC for bot programming).
Any new book on C++ will also refer to the newer version of STL.

Ok,ok, am I getting better now?
code:

// This is a drill
// A simple code
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Some people think they are"
         << endl
         << "Just plai stupid"
         << endl << endl;
    return 0;
}

Yes but why do you post every little program in this forum?
Compile it yourself it is much faster...
the 2 endl on the end are pointless...
and I never use endl I use "\n" wich does the same...

"I never use endl I use "\n" wich does the same."

Almost, but not quite the same.

"\n" will send a newline character to the output stream.  "endl" will send a newline character and flush the output stream.  Flushing the output will cause buffered data in memory to be written to the device.  Try this little example in MSVC++ to see the difference...
code:
#include <iostream.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main(void)
{
   cout << "Hello world!\n";

   _sleep(10000);
}

...and...
code:
#include <iostream.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main(void)
{
   cout << "Hello world!" << endl;

   _sleep(10000);
}

The first example doesn't output to the screen until the program exits.  The second example outputs to the screen as soon as the "endl" is reached.  Flushing the output stream can become important when you are sending output to a file on disk instead of to the display.  The operating system will hold output in memory until enough data exists to write a complete block on disk (or until you tell it to flush the output).

Well the program does exactly the same for but maybe that is because I use mingw32 compiler and not MSVC++.
To test it some more I tried:
code:
#include <iostream.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main(void)
{
  cout << "Hello world!" << endl;     
     _sleep(10000);
     cout << "Hello world!\n";     
     _sleep(10000); 
     cout << "Hello world!" << endl;     
     _sleep(10000);}


The output was: 
Hello world!
wait some time
Hello world!
wait some time
Hello world!
wait some time
program exits

So is "\n" the same as endl in Mingw32?

--------------------------------------------------
Yes, MingW32 does not buffer the output to the console so a endl is not required in this case.  If you redirect the output to a file and open another MS-DOS session to view the output file you will see the difference between flushing the output and not.  For example if you source was called hello.cpp and you did this in one MS-DOS session...

hello > hello.out

...and did this in the other MS-DOS session while the first one was paused...

type hello.out

...you would see that the first case doesn't have any output in the file until after the program exits.  The second case you can view the output in the file as soon as the program pauses.
