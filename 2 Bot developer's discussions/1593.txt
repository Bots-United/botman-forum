Okay, my bot gets into the game, it spawns, but it doesnt shoot. i checked the botdontshoot, and it said disabled. also, when the bots touch each other they get stuck, and sometimes when you try to hit them, the shots go right through them , and they are unhurt. whats up with that?

Which game are u making the bot?

And have u set catch all the starting game VGUI and set them?

Have u included some weapons in  bot_weapon_select_t and bot_fire_delay_t in the same sequence(both of them)?

You say that shots go right through them.  Are you also able to walk through them?  If so then they aren't being spawned correctly.  Calling the "player" function in the MOD DLL should spawn the player, but perhaps Snow Wars does this a little differently than other MODs.  You might try e-mailing the Snow Wars author to see if he's got any suggestions.

okay, i think snow wars uses info_player_deathmatch to spawn people instead of info_player_start. could that be the problem?

Only if you don't have those entities in the linkfunc.cpp file.  If they are in there then that shouldn't have anything to do with it.

Did you dump the list of exported entities in the Snow Wars DLL file and add those to linkfunc.cpp before building the bot?

yes i did, and as far as i could see, there was only 2 new entities, one for the weapon, and one for something else. i added them both before, so i dont think thats the problem. i dont see how snow war could use a different kind of spawning, since its basically a deathmatch mod.
