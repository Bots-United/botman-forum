Hey all

I want to compile my own client.dll
so I looked at the cl_dlls dir in the sdk map.
But there is a make file included that doesn't work for me (I am usinng Borland).
So can someone help me out with a makefile>?

You can not build the client.dll file with anything other than Microsoft Visual C++.

Well, actually you can, but you don't get to see anything since you need functions from the VGUI library to initialize the client's display.  The VGUI library was built using Microsoft Visual C++ and ONLY the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler can access functions from this library.

If you want to build the client.dll then you have to get a copy of Microsoft Visual C++ (no other way around it).
