You mean the BotHeadTowardWaypoint() and BotFindWaypoint() functions?

I think he just wants basic instructions on HOW vectors work.  Read these...

code:

edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;
int curr = pBot->curr_waypoint_index;
Vector v_waypoint = waypoints[curr].origin - pEdict->v.origin;
Vector botangles = UTIL_VecToAngles(v_waypoint);
pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = botangles.y;



if you want to make the bots turn instantly add this line:
code:

pEdict->v.v_angle.y = botangles.y;

How I would make the bot turn around..

code:

pEdict->v.v_angle[1] += 180;
if(pEdict->v.v_angle[1] > 360)
pEdict->v.v_angle[1] -= 360;

You'll need to call the BotFixIdealYaw(pEdict) function after messing about with the yaw. also you wouldn't need to check if its bigger than 360 because that should do it for you ;D

ya, but its just another line of code, and it uses less space doing it that way :) hehe( a byte or two means everything )

not when its already declared ;) Ok, its another few lines but saves <b>U</b> typing in more lines than you need to. ;D
