I am trying to get my bots work on Ricochet, after an hour of work i got the jump around the pads and such, shoot their enemy , and all is quite fine actually. I have linked all entities and the engine messages seem to be the same as valve for the moment (i did not experience any errors nor missing features so i guess it works ok).

the only flaw i have (and i also heared that Bluesy of Akimbot has this) is that i see a hand with a grenade (the normal HL grenade)! In Ricochet itself you don't have any model at all showing on your screen. 

How to fix this? Or should i do a continuous check in my StartFrame for all normal players and turn off the weapon model you see? I am guessing here though, there is afaik a model you see at your screen (weapon model) and is stored in the player.

anywayz, anyone got an idea?

You might want to wait for the next Half-Life SDK to be released (in a month or two?).  It should include the source code to Ricochet.  You can look through that to see what's causing the problem.

the weapon model is stored in pPlayer->v.viewmodel i think, just set it to 0.
