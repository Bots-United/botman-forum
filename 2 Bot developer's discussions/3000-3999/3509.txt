Anyone had any idea how to simulate "breathing" using a mm plugin??

I tried executing lookup and lookdown (both + and -) commands, but its jerky like hell and makes u wanna vommit.

Any better way of just augmenting the view position up and down just slightly every frame?

you could always alter the punchangle (Held in entvars) to a very small X value every now and then. The punchangle will decrease as time passes although it may be to quick of a decrease to look like breathing... :(
