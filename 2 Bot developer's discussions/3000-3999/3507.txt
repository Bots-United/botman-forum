I had tried active stereo viewing on Counterstrike using a stereo glasses. My question now: is it possible to do PASSIVE stereo view of the game.

Passive stereo meant that i would need 2 screens of the same scene at the same time(slightly augmented w.r.t each other). Is it possible to tie 2 cameras to a single entity/player in the game and get a different view from each of the camera???

Sure, you can split the screen using VGUI and create 2 separate veiw ports side by side (each with it's own camera offset a little from each other).  This will probably cut your frame rate in half, but with a nice GeForce3 video card (or better) you should still have acceptable performance.

Look in the Half-Life SDK (the big one, not the source code only one) for a document describing how to create VGUI "ports" (I don't remember the name of the file, but it's one of the .doc files).

Hi botman,
But i would not be able to do it in a mm plugin right? I was thinking whether if its possible to do it for counterstrike? The docs described creating the VGUI port for mod writers. Without the CS mod source, is it still possible?

No, you can't do this as a plugin.  It requires you to build the client DLL file.  You need to have your own MOD for this to work.
