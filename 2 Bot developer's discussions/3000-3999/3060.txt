trying to add bot support to our mod, we have 4 different gamemodes 2 of which our teamplay. The bots work great for the deathmatch modes, but when they play the teamplay modes they don't shoot at all. They join the game pick a team and a class but that's it. Any help would be great.

Thanks

Did you modify the UTIL_GetTeam() code in the util.cpp file to handle the way you store teams for your MOD?
