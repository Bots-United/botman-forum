I've had some experience on making a bot and c++ and now searching for some links that could show me what could I add to the bot template ,change,and many more..and maybe some code too..I think that you can learn from the bot source pretty good things....
Please give me some links to some pages..cuz I browsed here and didn't find such things

There aren't really any other links for creating bots for Half-Life.

There are plenty of links for creating bots for Quake I.  Half-Life is based on Quake I and many of the techniques are similar.  You will have to translate from Quake C format (used by Quake) to C++ (used by Half-Life), but Quake C is pretty easy to follow if you understand C and/or C++ pretty well.

See my "Links" page (in the "Bot developement or AI" section) for URLs of these websites.

you said you have already experience in coding a bot, so the template is a good point to start with. what do you want more ?

Look at the many Open Source HL bots out there (mine, Joe's, eLiTe's, Spyro's, Eric Bieschke's, etc...)
