Could anyone say me how can I get a location where terrorists ( or counter-terrorists) are spawned when round starts?
And how they are spawned (code)?

you can intercept the round start and then look where the terrorist or counterterrorist are placed, or if you want it more generally, just search for the spawn point entities. in CS that are info_player_start for the CT spawn points and info_player_deathmatch for the TEs

Thank you! But I have another question:
How can I intercept the round start (in CS)?

there are various ways to do so, i use this :
code:

edict_t* pfnFindEntityByString(edict_t *pEdictStartSearchAfter, const char *pszField, const char *pszValue)
{
      if (!strcmp(pszValue, "info_map_parameters") && (mod_id == CSTRIKE_DLL)){


but if you had used the search function of this forum, you would have found something like this yourself.
