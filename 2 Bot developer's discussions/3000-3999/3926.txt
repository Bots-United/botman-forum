Is there a convenient way to find a robot once it's been created? 
Can you force it to spawn in a known location or even next to your player?

Thanks,

A bot always have the FL_FAKECLIENT bit set in its entvars_t "flags" field of its entity variable structure.

// is this client a bot ?
if (pClientEdict->v.flags & FL_FAKECLIENT)
   ; // yes, it is.

The MOD DLL is responsible for spawning players where it wants to. But you can arbitrarily change an entity's location once it has been spawned. Look for the SET_ORIGIN() macro.
