Hey, didn't know where to post this.  Anyways, I'm posting to say that I've updated your BSP Viewer to render a wireframe mesh ontop of the world to show brush breakdown without the previous lag.  The mesh also has the option to render polys that wern't dropped because of the PVS but aren't seen on screen because they are culled or behind other objects.

Here is a pic of what I mean (without the dropped polys):

I also managed to fix the frustum problems (you were retriving the projection and modelview matracies before you updated your cammera (ie. from the last frame) so culling was always one frame behind, works perfect now.)  If you want the code just let me know how I can send it to you.

I stuck it up on my site.

Changes:
Fixed frustum problems. 
Hacked fix for texture problems caused by maps with textures larger then 512 pixels (it'll work up to 1024 now). 
Resize problem on start fixed (the black bar). 
Crosshair stays in middle of screen on resize. 
"Camera position out of range." error removed (your just repositioned at 0, 0, 0). 
GUI added (menu). 
Various additional options that previously were only changed in the config file added to GUI (not all though). 
Optimized wireframe mesh. 
Added a bunch more 'modes' to the edge option (press e or look in menu). 
Keyboard can take multiple keys (ie. you can strafe and walk at the same time). 
Frustum culling added for entity models. 
You can view your entity poly counts now (they probably aren't culled the same way as in HL though). 
Option to view scene info & crosshair. 
Option to render models or not. 
Option to render entities or not. 
Option to render the skybox or not. 
Solid and textured render modes. 
Right click and drag to move camera's look at position. 
'Z' key puts you into the old mode of 'looking' (like in WC). 
Ability to load a new level without restarting the app. 
WASD can be used to move (R & F for up and down respectively). 
Minor additional optimizations. 
Gave it an icon. 

Notes:
-Light Grey Outline = World Poly.
-Blue Outline = Entity Poly.
