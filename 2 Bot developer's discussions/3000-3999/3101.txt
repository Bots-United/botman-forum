read the thread "anyone experienced in metamod coding", I describe a method where you can make any bot compatible with metamod in half a minute coding.

Thanks, is your bot going to be an official MetaMod bot?

It would be on their page, it kind of attracts them to MetaMod.

No, I don't think Will Day would put such links on his page. The method I am using to get my bot work together with Metamod does not make it a Metamod plugin, i.e. this is not the "regular" way to do it (but IMO still the simplest and the safest, no matter what they say). Eventually I could notify him about it anyhow, but I already tried to mail him one day and he never replied, so I think either he is way too busy for that, or he doesn't care a s*** about it (might be, after all).

I think it's a good idea that you have to use the bot to load MetaMod, very smart. If I wanted to put Admin commands into the RACC code, where would it go?

If you are talking about commands that can only be run on the (listen)server, look at the ClientCommand() function. There is a check in it for commands that can be sent by all clients and for listenserver commands only. You can also look at my ServerCommand() function, which works following Botman's idea, using a server CVAR. I know that with the current version of the SDK, there is the ability to register new server commands, but I was too lazy to code that. However if you do, why not post your code here ?

I gotta write some first, but when I'm done I will.
