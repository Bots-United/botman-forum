botman, when i sneak behind HPB (in cstrike) and knife them, then  they try to turn back and pull up his knife also... wow, i dont think that HPb can use their knife.
and why HPB sometimes shakes his POV?? (e.g. when shooting at enemy)

and how can i kick or slap HPB??

The HPB bot will "listen" for sounds behind it.  It will turn around if you are running up behind it (if you are walking it shouldn't hear you).

The HPB bot will use the knife in Counter-Strike if you are close enough to them (just like they use the crowbar in Half-Life deathmatch).  Otherwise they will use the handgun.  I didn't implement any buy menu code in the HPB bot since I don't play Counter-Strike and didn't want to go to the trouble of adding any buy menu support for something that I don't play.

They "shake" the POV when aiming to simulate the way a human will aim at an opponent.  The bot will calculate the X and Y angle to aim the gun based on where the target is in the field of view.  The bot will track this target using fairly large angles to start with (5 degrees).  As the bot gets closer to the target, these aiming angles are reduced little bit by little bit (simulating a human zeroing in on the target).  If the target remains still, the bot's aiming angles will keep getting smaller and smaller, giving it better aim (and less shaking around).  If the target moves while the bot is aiming at it, the aiming angles will begin to grow larger again (simulating a human having to move the mouse more to track the moving target).  The bot will constantly keep trying to decrease these aiming angles to zero in on the target, but the angles will get larger, the more the target moves around.  This increasing and decreasing of the angles while the bot is contantly adjusting it's aim is what causes the jerking around when using observer mode from the bot's point of view.

You can kick a bot from the server just like you would kick a player.  Bring down the console and use "kick #N" where N is the player number from the "stat" or "status" command, or use "kick playername", where playername is the name of the player.

About your new aiming system, Botman, why didn't you made your bots lock progressively on the target deviating on the same line, like humans do ? It wouldn't be so dizzy looking through your bot's eyes...
I think there was a thread a few time ago that was about aiming systems...

William's site is on www.cgf-ai.com
The botepidemic domain was been bought .

I'm not the most concerned person but I think I know sufficiently Botman's code to make a short answer...

Yes this feature is also in the HPB template ; the weapon selection code has not changed much since the template (only a bug has been fixed about proximity weapon switching)

The aiming system is based on random offset vectors to simulate the human imprecision. The imprecision is based on skill in template 3, but since HPB 2.1 it's also based on the distance and a few other things. However it is still a random deviation system that looks dizzy if you monitor the bot in a first-person view (the bot locking everywhere around his target). William's CGF aiming is a much more complete approach. Since botepidemic.com is down I don't have any special URL to post here, but his vision of aiming includes distance, reaction time, movement of both the bot and his target and aiming time, this producing a smooth, filtered and quite human-like aim. I tried to implement such a system in my bot (you can look at it, it is open-source: www.racc-ai.com).
