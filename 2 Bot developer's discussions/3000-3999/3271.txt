I posted the thread about the bot freezing problem. I sent an email to Jehannum asking him aboutthe problem, and showed him the code I was using (The same code adapted from TheFatal and used in the HPB_Bot)

I'm working on my own bot, but the same principle applies, I implemented this into the HPB_Bot and it worked fine.

To find out how calculate the msecval correctly (Or more precisely, more ACURATE than the current method proposed by TheFatal) check out an article I created at: http://www.geocities.com/mattkimbo/other/msec.htm which includes the email I sent to Jehannum and I recieved.

Periannath34, 
  I tried your code seems like it created a bug in my bot lol, its for TFC it really shouldn't matter what MOD right?  Well when I spawned my bot to roam the world they just run up to the wall then stop ROFL my bots roam on waypoints what I don't get is why it worked before and not now since I added in your code hmm?

Nope, the MOD wouldn't make any difference. If they are running at all and falling to the floor (as long as it is at a realistic speed, But I can't say the same speed as the player in TFC unles they are the same class) then you have done it. Without looking at the "Going after a waypoint" code in the HPB_Bot, I'm guessing that you have *maybe* accidently removed a "return" in the newly named BotThinkFunction. I have just posted the source code I changed on my site for you, and you can get it here:

The whole thing is set up as a borland compile though so keep that in mind.

Argh hehe I might just recode my entire bot so its not based off of anyones (like HPB_bot) and use a better method to load it.

Botman's method is currently the only viable approach, seeing as Valve are almost definately going to disable the wrapping of other areas of the code and various injection techniques that are used.

If someone else cares to present another way of loading bot code, without using an OGC style "loader" or wrapping the mp.dll's then I'm all ears.
