Botman, I don't know if you remember but several months ago I sent you a few minor changes I made to the monster library to make it work with my adminmod plugin.

I have now made a 2nd more significant round of changes, which can be downloaded here:

http://www.ravenousbugblatterbeast.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/

My changes to the DLL are:

* Uses "addons" standard file layout.

* Revised argument format for monster command to provide many more options when dynamic spawning

* Sets monster_version in a public cvar so it can be seen from server browsers

* Sets location of config, precache and skill files used in private cvars

* Supports map-specific monster config, precache and skill files in either the maps folder
or the addons/monster/config folder.

* Supports dynamically spawning monsters at specific co-ordinates

* Fixed possible crash when a monster had no valid enemies

* Supports giving players frags for monsters in config file as well as when dynamically spawned

* You can restrict monsters to attacking a single team from config file or when dynamically spawned

* You can restrict monsters to attacking a single player when dynamically spawned 

* Added respawnmonsters command to respawn all monsters immediately (used at start of round in CS by the Admin Mod plugin)

* The apache helicopter will spawn above the specified co-ordinates rather than at them.  This prevents them from spawning burried in the ground when spawned dynamically.

* The plugin will run Admin Mod commands implemented by plugin_blatt_monster
when a monster dies / makes a kill if the monster is given a "tag"

* Player name argument in monster command now supports steamid's, wonid's and partial player names (code borrowed from Admin Mod)

* Changed all SetThink and similar calls to use ANSI compliant C++ so they compile in GCC 3 (with a little help from Alfred Reynolds - apparently it was a bug in the SDK sources)

* Added 2 new possible spawn points around the player for dynamic spawning.

* try {} catch handlers around all metamod callbacks to reduce the risk of bugs crashing the server.

The Admin mod plugin supports the following:

* Dynamically spawn mosnters from the client console by entering player name, or by aiming
at them and pressing a key / extra mouse button.

* In CS all monsters are killed at the end of around and all monsters in the configuration file respawn at the start of a round.

* Monster Mania mode where random monsters are spawned on random players at semi-random intervals.

If anyone has any suggestions for further features (other than adding support for more monsters), please post them here. My current ideas are:

* Dynamic spawn on whatever bit of ground / wall you are looking at in freelook.

* Randomise the order in which the positions around the player are tried when dynamic spawning instead of always trying directly in front of them first.

Cool.  Lots of new additions.  Maybe if you get time you can add the Gargantua since that's what everybody seems to e-mail me and ask me about.  :)

Actually, I don't think I've ever met one.  

I'm guessing this won't be a popular opinion around here, but as a game I never liked half-life and never bothered to play past the first few levels.  Mainly due to the fact that I never saved it often enough and always found myself restarting from a point where I didn't have enough weapons/ammo/health to get past whatever section I was in.

It was quickly consigned to the bottom drawer until about a year later someone told me about downloading counter-strike. I think the most advanced monster I met in its natural environment was the islave.
