Hey,

I would like to know about waypoint checking like in Pod-bot. I tried to make my own algorithm and I'm still busy, but while I'm planning, I would like to get some 3rd person advice, tips, etc. I'm currently just making cool Waypoint editing functions for my bot before I'm adding bot AI stuff.

Thanks

It looks like the forum was a little quiet for a few weeks. No matter! I've got it to work!
