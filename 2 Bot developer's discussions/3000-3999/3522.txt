I'm having serious trouble with the FakeClientCommand. I've tried using botmans and the racc one. the one in the hpb_bot template half works. I can choose classes with it in DMZ and managed to get it to say hi (actually it was hi all u b****rds... anyway...). But nothing else seems to work. Then I tried the racc one. This doesn't work at all.

Currently I have basic DMZ support. Bots join, pick a class, and run around and fight hand to hand. When they haven't seen any enemy for a while they should power up (console command: "+pup; wait; -pup). for some reason this gets combined with the say "hey all u b..." and you get bots running round saying "+pup; wait; -pup.

I have both versions of FakeClientCommand (One is now refered to as FakeClientCommandB) and neither work fully. kill doesn't work either. the only things i have seen working are say and class_num. 

any ideas??

Make sure you aren't sending several FakeClientCommands() in a row (when it comes to menu stuff).  For example, don't do this...

FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "1", NULL);
FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "5", NULL);
FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", "3", NULL);

...it can cause problems with commands getting "lost".  Send a command, set a flag to intercept the network message response (in bot_client.cpp), when the flag gets set, send another command, etc.

I'm not sending multiple commands. I've replace the bot fire weapon function with one that either punches (+attack), kicks (+attack2) or "ki blasts" (+beam). attack and attack2 are handled using IN_ATTACK etc. But FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "+beam", NULL, NULL); won't work. that is just one single command on its own. The function in question is:

bool BotFireWeapon( Vector v_enemy, bot_t *pBot, int weapon_choice)
{
      edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;
      float distance = v_enemy.Length();  // how far away is the enemy?

   // If Attack Not Chosen...
   weapon_choice = RANDOM_FLOAT(1,3);
   
   // Carry Out Attack
   if ( weapon_choice==ATTACK_PUNCH )
   {
         pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK;
         return TRUE;
   }
   else if ( weapon_choice==ATTACK_KICK )
   {
         pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK2;
         return TRUE;
   }
   else if ( weapon_choice==ATTACK_KIBLAST )
   {
         FakeClientCommandB(pBot->pEdict, "+beam;", "wait;", "-beam");
           return TRUE;
   }

   return FALSE;
   
}

I did have some code in to release the IN_ keys but that didn't help. HELP!!!

also FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "+beam", NULL, NULL) doesnt work either...

The FakeClientCommand() stuff in RACC does work. If you can't get it working, that's because you haven't implemented right in your code. There are quite an amount of things that I changed compared to botman's template, double-check that.

And you can't issue delay commands (starting with "+" and "-", that representing some key being pressed down and released) for fakeclients this way. The "+beam" and "-beam" commands HAVE to be represented somehow in the pev->button bitmap field of the calling entity. So just do pev->button I= IN_BEAM_OR_WHATEVER_KEY_THAT_IS

And you can't make fakeclients say something using the command "say". You have to use botman's UTIL_HostSay, which is a ripoff of what is in the SDK for doing the same, anyway.

[edited] oh, and your code won't work, btw. You'd better change your RANDOM_FLOAT(1,3); to a RANDOM_LONG(1,3); I guess, right ?

The Random_float seems to work. I tried moving all the stuff i did with dmz onto RACC. That worked but the bots left for no reason after bout 30secs. I used the valve version of the source.

I've just started again with the latest hpb_bot source.

RANDOM_FLOAT(1,3) will return *floating-point* numbers, such as 1.0124567, 2.000154, 2.9888664 and so on, between 1.0000000 and 3.0000000.

RANDOM_LONG(1,3) will only return you either 1, or 2, or 3. That's rather what you want, isn't it ?

Yeah. Thanks. I thought there might have been something wrong with the FakeClientCommand or the way i was using it. But now it seems so stupid - +type commands are handled by the client.dll which a bot doesn't have... doh
