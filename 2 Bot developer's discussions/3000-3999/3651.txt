Im not sure if BSP Files are a technology based on how a engine renders, or wether its just a file format id use. Point is, I know Quake and the Unreal engines vary, But I have no idea how an engine works, so this may seem stupid.

Id usually make THE game engine, so I guess every one will fall over their selves to make a Doom III engine based game. Here we go:

Will Doom III use bsp files? Im wondering if it's worth learning how Quake renders an environment and stores maps so I can make auto-waypointing programs and things like that.

If I learn how the Quake, Quake II and Quake III engines deal with bsp files (And so most of the games I play, i.e. HL and SiN) will alll that knolage still be meaning full when we move to Doom III?

BSP means "Binary Space Partition" tree.  A tree is a very efficient data structure that allows you to rapidly access data stored in the nodes or leaves of the tree).  Binary Space means the the space (or area) inside a level is split in two parts (binary meaning two).  Each of those areas are split in half, and so on and so on, until you get to the smallest area where the space is a small convex area (convex means no part of the area "bends" inward into the space contained by that area).

BSP trees don't really have anything to do with the way the 3D objects are rendered.  BSP trees have to do with the way surfaces and areas are stored in a 3D environment.  There are many different techniques that can be used to render the exact same BSP data.  Since BSP trees are so efficient at storing 3D surfaces and areas, most 3D engines store data in some sort of BSP format (there are several different variations of a BSP tree).

From everything that I've seen, Doom III will still use a BSP format to store the data.  The biggest change between Quake III and Doom III will be the way lighting is handled.  Doom III will have dynamic real-time lighting that allows for things like swinging lights and moving shadows.

If you are interesting in learning more about BSP tree see some of the Quake BSP tutorials...

botman:
I'm quite sure that DoomIII do not use a pure BSP tree to represent the scene geometries anymore. I can say this because its quite simply impossible for carmack to do the realtime shadows without some form of object hierarchy built into the map data.

One of the method he revealed about the dynamic shadows done in D3 is the use of double opposite normal vertices for every single vertex. This means that he have 2 points to represent every single vertex with one's normal pointing this way and another pointing the other direction. Then from the position of the light, he determines the "border" vertices of all the objects in the scene and then extrude the "back-facing" vertex to infinity(back-facing means the vertex with the normal that is pointing away from the light direction). Wah la, he got the shadow volume.

Now the point here is, he needs to calculate the "border" vertices or some would say suelloute of the objects in the scene that cast shadow. If he does not have some form of object hierarchy informatin, he would have to go through every single vertices in the scene.... which i think is plain madness... but then again, u never know. its car-mad.
