I just read an interesting article in the AI Wisdom book (buy it, you won't regret it!) about response curves. It sounded like it might be the ultimate solution for me to teach my fuzzy actions to behave and even improve aiming. However I got lost in the theory (the author stated it as easy, D'OH!) and was unable to find related stuff when doing a websearch. Did anybody out there already use them ? I'm especially unsure on how the sampling of input relates to the output and how to use the bucket/edges stuff.
Thanks in advance !

Maybe you will find more stuff related to what you search if you search it about digital signal processors. I have been studying electronics and that's typically the type of algorithm we burn in DSPs. It has plenty of purposes, AI and fuzzy logic are ones amongst others, so I'm not sure if you will find concrete examples of what you search, however the response curves theory is everywhere the same. I could do a bit of research for you but for me it's old (several years) I was teached it, so you might better find out yourself for a start :)

I dont know what this bucket/edges stuff is, since amazon keeps telling me that it'll still take about 1-2 weeks till I get the book :)

About this fuzzy stuff, there was once upon a time a link to an interesting paper about the q3 bot here. There was also a chapter about fuzzy weapon selection. http://www.idsoftware.com/home/jan/q3abotai/Q3ABotAI_15.pdf
I havn't read much about fuzzy logic, with the stuff I read I thought this is very similar to NNs and since i've more experiences with NNs, my interest for fuzzy logic wasn't that big ...

€ : shit, the link isn't working any more ... but i have it on hd :D

PM: I could imagine a dozen of purposes I just want to know how to apply it goddamnit ! ;)
Although your hint about it being used in DSPs a lot seems to point into the right direction I still was unable to find the algorithm or a concrete example...

@$3.1415rin: I have the Q3 Thesis as well however what you probably meant is the fuzzy selection of weapons explained in that text, it doesn't use response curves in any way.
Fuzzy logic generally is kind of similar to NNs since both are used to find good decisions. But AFAIK (which admittedly isn't much so far) NNs return absolute numbers (of course changing over time when the NNs get trained) where fuzzy logic returns if a condition is met to a certain degree. For example when used for color detection and you only have the binary case of black & white only, using fuzzy logic it could return different shades of gray. I'm using it to have the Bots decide about the best next action, which are already previously affected by the 'fuzzified' emotion stuff. Making it a total fuzzy mess ! :)
Very good for unpredictable/emergent behaviour but bad for tight squad rules...

well, there are different types of NNs. You are probably referring to some sort of binary NNs, i.e. the neurons get an input and then the output is 0 or 1. But there are as well NNs which use continous Activation functions, mainly sigmoid activation functions. This means that there can also be shades of gray as you call it, depending on how all outputs are 'right' or only some for some output.
for further discussion i better wait for the book :)
