Has anyone ever tried to use the MegaHAL conversation simulator for bot chat ?

http://www.megahal.net/

I downloaded the MegaHAL source code, changed a few things and built the executable. Well I find that program talks passably stupid. The fact that it is based only on word succession probabilities to build sentences makes it say something coherent at max one time out of four.

(me): espèce de bot
(computer): un bot est un programme quand tu tire dessus
(me): tu comprends rien à ce que je raconte!
(computer): je comprends les armes
(me): parle-moi de Half-Life
(computer): Half-Life c'est un jeu c'est des coéquipiers tu leur tire dessus
(me): et les armes ?
(computer): les armes c'est bien mais pas pour les bot

This was a conversation with my MegaHAL (its brain was about 12 hours old and we talked exclusively about Half-Life, I gave him more than a thousand of sentences)
Translation:

(me): you damn bot
(computer): a bot is a programme when you shoot at him
(me): you don't understand a f***ing word of what I say!
(computer): I understand the weapons
(me): tell me about Half-Life
(computer): Half-Life that's a game that's teammates you shoot at him
(me): what about the weapons ?
(computer): weapons they are good but not for the bot

You see what I mean... this stupid machine ate more than several hundreds of words and I wasted almost 12 hours of my time to learn it about Half-Life. Here the results.

I would like to know if someone of you has already tried this conversation simulator and got more success than I did. Especially Count Floyd since we talked about it in Amsterdam recently...

I think you got yourself a "yoda" bot. But give it a few thousands more line and i bet it can talk better than master jedi yoda.
