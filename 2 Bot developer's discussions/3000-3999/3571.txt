I got two questions:

I need to do the following in a mm plugin.

How to detect map change?

The HPB source does
((gpGlobals->time + 0.1) < previous_time)
to check for map change during every StartFrame right? But is there a more efficient way to do it??? I'm quite reluctant to do anything in StartFrame cos its called so many times every sec..

How to detect round change?

The HPB source shows that BotClient_FLF_WinMessage as the message sent during a round change...but the comments say its for frontline force only... So i basically still do not know how to detect a round change in CS... Can someone help me?


Edit: I'm sorry, my understanding of the HPB source is still not very good. Please help me learn.

for the round start you should better use the search function of the forums here and for a map change you could take a look at DispatchSpawn :)

"round start" depends on the MOD you are creating the plugin for.  Counter-Strike does rounds one way, Frontline Force does them another, other MODs will do them even other ways.

If you want a "generic" method of determining that a new map has loaded, you can check the gpGlobals->time to see when it gets reset (like the HPB bot does).  You can also catch the "worldspawn" entity being spawned (as is done in the HPB bot also).  The problem with catching the "worldspawn" entity being spawned is that world hasn't been initialized yet, so you can't do things like spawn entities, change CVARS, etc. because they haven't been initialized yet.  If all you want to do is clear some global memory then intercepting "worldspawn" being spawned (in DispatchSpawn) would be a good way to do this.  If you want to do something else (like creating things in the game), you'll have to do it another way.

Thanks, 
i think i got the map change part figured out. But how does CS do round change and how do i detect such a change?

Edit: Did many search on "roundstart" "startround" etc etc etc. All turns up non-related threads...

then use round start in two words and search only in the developer forum. i'm sure you'll find something

maybe this ? : http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=3148

the search function can be useful, as other bot sources are :)

My bot is for cs too, sources are released, so you also might have a look there :) just click on my signature
