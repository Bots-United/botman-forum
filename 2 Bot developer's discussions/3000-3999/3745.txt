I'm trying to add bot support for an additional mod (Firearms actually).  I've modified the h_export.cpp file to add recognition for the firearms plugin and load the appropriate dll.  I've also commented out pretty much all the bot creation code in dll.cpp

This all loads absolutely fine in TFC, but when I try to load Firearms, I get 

LoadLibrary Failed on e:\blah blah blah\hpb_bot.dll
Host_Error: Could not get DLL API from e:\blah blah blah\hpb_bot.dll

Anyone have any ideas what I'm missing?

I did read the readme and I've read the majority of the code.

I was just a tard and made a typo

I'm not using the template, just the original source code.  It's far from functional, but I can try if you want.  I'm usually on AIM as "Houndogg"
