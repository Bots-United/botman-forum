Open the .dsp file.  MSVC will create the .dsw for you.

"what happen??"

Someone set up us the bomb?  ;D

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "i feel my memory is become low..low and drop my fps".

Adding bots to your server (you are creating a server when you run bots) will cause your FPS to drop down somewhat.  Each bot will also use up memory.  The more bots you add the lower the FPS will get and the more memory they will use up.

i know that running more bots will needs more ram. but i think that Plbot and podbot dont eat ram too much..

what`re the diff with hpb??

if hpb is so basic with cs, why its eat more ram than pod or plbot?


and how to slap those hpb??
do i need to add more code?

The HPB bot uses some memory for the waypoint routing tables (if you have a large number of waypoints and you have waypoints available for a map).

The HPB bot wasn't really made to support Counter-Strike anyway.  You should stick to using PODbot or REALbot or someother bot designed for Counter-Strike if you're only interested in playing the game.

If you are trying to create your own bot and don't want the waypoint routing stuff using up memory, just remove the waypoint.cpp file and all it's functions from the source code and rebuild the bot.  Then create your own navigation functions to do whatever you want.
