Since ppl visiting this forum are probably doing bots or mods, i would like to know if there is anyone planning on doing bots or mods for some of the newer engines?? For example the yet-to-be released UR2003 or maybe the newer Quake engines. 
I'm particularly interested in finding out if anyone here is planning on doing something on UR2003, it seems to be geared towards letting 3rd party developers do mods and stuff easily.

That depends on whether the engine will support bots.  Many don't.

You either have to have a way of creating a fake client on the server side or you have to have the network protocol document so that you can create a fake client on your own (which is the way some Quake I bots worked).

Just because a game supports multiple players doesn't necessarily mean it will support bots.

Actually I don't think that the fakeclient thingy is that important. When we talk about bots, do we talk about player opponents and/or allies that are a little bit more clever than the monsters in the game, or do we simply focus on the technical matter "how to fake a client" ?. If the engine supports MODs, it will always be possible to create some kind of monster that will "look like" a bot. Except that it won't be counted as a player but as a monster.

Btw, congrats for your new job, botman ! What's it about ?

yeah, congrats botman. U'll probably be doing things related to CSCZ??

Back to the topic, for newer engines like the UR2003, the developers (epicgames) had explicitly said that they had designed it so that its very easy to mod and extend. They probably would have some fake client like entry for bots. Yeah, like pierre pointed out, probably its possible to have monsters that are like bots. So its like mixing monsters and network players together.

To the question of modding for the newer engines, does anyone have any links or information on upcoming mod plans or mod resources for these newer engines??

why do you think he wrote something about planethalo ( which is btw not halo related, but it's half a metaphore I think :D ) ?

I'm not working on Condition Zero.  I'm currently working on adding bots to Bond Nightfire multiplayer and CTF.

When Nightfire is done, I'll be moving on to helping out with porting Halo from the X-Box to the PC.

Sounds good.  Are you able to give out what kind of navigation you'll be using?  Waypoints, zones?

I'm using waypoints (same waypoint editing system as in the HPB bot).  I'm using an A* path finding algorithm to generate random paths to a goal.

The combat AI is more sophisticated than the code the HPB bot uses.  For example, the HPB bot always heads straight toward an attacker and keeps running in that direction and attacking until one of the combatants is dead.  The Bond Nightfire bot keeps it's distance from enemies most of the time (distance will vary depending on what weapons it has deployed).  For example the sniper rifle gives greater accuracy so the bot doesn't need to get as close to the enemy.  This helps by not letting the enemy get better aim since the bot isn't constantly moving closer to the enemy (in a straight line directly towards it).

There's lots of other stuff that I've added that I had always wanted to put in the HPB bot, but I never had the time to sit down and implement it all.  Now I've got 12 hours a day, seven days a week to improve the AI.  You'll have to buy the game (and/or read the reviews when it comes out) to see some of the things the bots can do.  ;D

Yes, although that looks like the console (PS2) version.

Gearbox is working on the PC version.  There are other developers working on console versions of the same game (with slightly different levels and gameplay).  Here's some items on gamespy.com about the PC version of Nightfire...
