I know this isnt a bot related question, but i figure you are all in this forum so here it goes...

I have implememted a vgui hud and every time i restart the server or change the map, the hud doesnt update itself very often (like every 30 or more seconds) my code is pretty much the same as the tutorials, but with a hell of a lot more hud elements and such.

Thank you for reading this and you help will be greatly appreciated... :)

How did you implement the hud? From a mm plugin? I'm interested in doing something with the vgui hud too. ;)

I'm sure botman would not mind as long as its about HL coding stuff.

HUDs are client-side stuff. I doubt you can implement such a thing in a Metamod plugin, you would have to write your own client.dll (which would be rejected by secure servers, unless you are developing a complete MOD on your own of course).

I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that this is for a MOD that i am developing from the SDK 2.1 and not a mm plugin...  It is client side and after a server restart of a map change it doesnt update sooner than 30 seconds.  So you have the 9mmAR and you shoot 30 rounds, then at least thiry seconds later, the HUD updates to show this.  The hud works fine with the first map i boot up, then when the map changed it does this.... :(

Wouldn't it be a good idea to send an UpdateClientData() with send_weapons to TRUE from the server to all your clients once the map gets restarted or changed ?
