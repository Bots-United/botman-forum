I have a question regarding network messages in mods.

From the SDK, to get a screen fade effect, we define a struct of the screen fade message, register that message, then when u want a screen fade u just simply send the message.

I could not find anywhere in the SDK that defines how the actual screen fade was done. My question is: is the screenfade function implemented inside the HalfLife engine??

If it is, is it possible for mod developers to create their own custom message type, for example a blink message which they could send and make the screen blink?

Where would the implementation of such a message be?? It could not be possibly be within the engine since its something out of the blue...


Edit: I found a suspicious function FadeClientVolume in the enginefuncs_t. But there are no instances of this function being called anywhere in the SDK. Is this the one used to make the screen fade?

All of the TE_ messages are embedded in the engine code.  You don't have access to this code, so you can't see what was done and you can't change the effect.

You can create your own effects messages by using TriangleAPI to draw things on the screen (if you want the screen to go black, draw a large black polygon).  You could create a network message to display a swirl of particles (look for some particle tutorials on game development sites and port that to TriAPI).  Just about any effect that you can think of can be created using TriAPI.

Thanks botman, i got the idea. I'm just curious how a msg like ScreenFade is linked to the actual function that does the screen fade.
Say if i use the TriAPI to write my own effects, how do i link it to a msg?? Say i did a "LensFlare" effect, i then REG_USER_MSG my own msg "LensFlareMsg". how do i link this msg to the actual function that does the effect?? Its at my mod code, so .....

make a class with CHudBase and link it by using HOOK_MESSAGE(<message>) and DECLARE_MESSAGE(<class>,<message>). I found this out by looking at botmans radar tutorial !
