Just recently started using MonsterMod for MetaMod. I have a Counter-Strike Server running ClanMod and HLGuard.

I want to know if I can get this thing...

...into Counter-Strike one way or another, with MonsterMod or with another program?

We basically need it for the n00bs who come into the server, new to CS, so we can torture them :D

We have already been using things like the ninja's and apache helicopter, but now we need this monster!

There have been several people who have requested the gargantua before.  So far nobody had the time (or the desire) to modify the Monster plugin source code, add the gargantua, then release the enhanced version to the general public.

You can search the "Metamod" section of this forum for "garg" and you should find these posts.

AFAICT, there will be an issue on porting the gargantua to Monster. When a gargantua dies, there is no real "death animation". The monster model faces the listen server client, then shrinks/enlarge a couple of times, using I suppose a specific hack in the HL engine, then it bombs to pieces.

IMO you will have trouble making this work with several clients at a time.

Then don't make it freak out, it does have a death animation, and it's played as it dies.  You just neve really see anything beyond the first second.  Load the model and take a look, death animation works perfectly fine if you modify the normal monster code in the HLSDK.
