A *while* ago my friend Avater created a thread to show his mapanalysing bot. 

http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=1294

I wasn't able to create a bot myself that time, simply because i could't read, nor write any code in C, or other programming languages. I learned C++ in the last year and I'm fond of it. I really want to thank botman what he did to create the HPB_bot, and publish it. I'm sure it is a great stimulans to others to learn C(++) or another programming language. 

Now I can (very pleased :)  ) show some pictures of the maps my bot analysed. (The pictures show heightmaps) Here is the link:

I have another method to analyse this map than Avater had. Avater let the bots walk through the maps, and saved it into a file. I get the playercoordinates, and create an analysing cube around the player, using tracelines. While not all the sides of the cube are stuck in walls, the cube advances trough the map. This is the way the map got analysed. Walls are written down in the file as a structure with six floats, representing the edge coordinates of the cube. (x,y,z) For the navigation (which i've not yet began to code) I only have to walk through the list of structures, to determine the path the bot has to follow.

I know that my method of analysing is *very* outdated, because botman made that nice map slicer. I am probably going to use that slicer to write my structures down the file, (so that i don't have to change my method of navigation) but i wanted to finish my own method of analysing first. 

PS: botman i hope you don't have to use babelfish anymore ( :) )  Avater is still not *that* good in English:)

It looks very interesting and what are you going to do now? Does the bot know the mission targets?

No, i've only a plan for the navigation, I haven't coded the navigation allready. Concerning the mission targets: I make the bot try to complete the mission target: for example the terrorists on a 'de_xxxx' map will try to plant the bomb, and counter do all what's possible to prevent the bomb being planted. The mission objective will never be: kill the others, so the bots will try to complete the mission objective. I think that's the purpose Counter-Strike was initially developed for.

on a de_xxxxxxx map the objective may be to plant the bomb, but the objective may also be to plant the bomb on any map not just becuase of the filename, you're better checking to see if a func_bomb_target or info_bomb_target spawns to determine it is a DE map. Similarly check to see if a hostage_entity is spawn to determine if it is a CS map.

Looks good. For navigation, you could go for the Quake3Arena area based approach (documented over here:
http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/Publications/MSc/2001-VanWaveren-MSc.html
)

That would make it a "pure Dutch" implementation (for what that's worth).

Have fun (veel plezier),

Thanks! It looks like it is a really interesting article. I'm not able to read it right now because i'm too busy this moment, but I will take the time for it next week to read it. 

[Edit]
It looks right now that the link to the PDF-document doesn't work.

The link to the .pdf file on that web page worked for me.  It goes to an FTP site to download it.  If you've got any download managers running (like GetRight or Gozilla) you might need to disable them first.  Try clicking the link again to see if it was just down for a brief period of time.
