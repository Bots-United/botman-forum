How does one make navigation for DeathMatch bots, when seemingly there are no goals?  Is this just a random waypoint path, or is there some method to this madness (mmmmmm...madness...;D)?

actually there are goals. You should have a function like:

void assign_goal(bot_t *pBot)
{
 // code here
}

where you will check what kind of weapons he has. You could make it so that bots hunt for weapons in a specific distance. Or you can make them hunt to the best weapons. However, that would make them a bit to predictable. 

Goals can be:
ammo (when running low)
health (when < 100%)
weapons (when not having it already)
etc.

what about collecting items and weapons if you are without a threat? and pursue and engage the threat when you meet one.

precisely, there are enough goals for a DM bot as you can see :)

...and don't forget about pushing air strike buttons like in the crossfire or doublecross maps!  Those are always fun goals!  :)

...Or just put some goals at strategic places in a map and let the bot randomly choose a goal.
