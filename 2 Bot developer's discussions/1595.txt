Ok, now I am trying to make a red waypoint for the
red team.

I searched the WaypointAdd() and found this line:
So I add this

   if(g_team == 0)
   {      //red team, draw red beam
            ALERT(at_console, "\nAdding red team waypoint...\n");      
         WaypointDrawBeam(pEntity, start, end, 30, 0, 255, 0, 0, 250, 5);
   }
   else if(g_team == 1) 
   {//blue team, draw blue beam
               ALERT(at_console, "\nAdding blue team waypoint...\n");      
            WaypointDrawBeam(pEntity, start, end, 30, 0, 0, 0, 255, 250, 5);
   }

At first when I add it in the map, it's red.
But after like one second it becomes blue...

any solutions?
