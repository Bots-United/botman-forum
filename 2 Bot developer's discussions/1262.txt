I've noticed a few bugs with the ai :


It doesn't drown(stupid quake)

The Grunts sometimes duck for cover next to a grenade

The code appears to be unfinished?????!!!!

It doesn't do very much whilst idling

With the models, or the hit areas :

If you shoot a monster in certain places with a very powerful weapon(1000 damage), it survives

I too have noticed all those issues, with the exception of the drowning. But then I never battled a grunt under water.
