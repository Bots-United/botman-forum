How would I be able to go into implementing Realistic Aiming?  I've tried several things but all of what that was worth it didn't work :(

I know how to program so don't say I can't come up with code.  I just need a basic idea of how to get started with it?

Thanx

I would think you would need to adjust how quickly the bot can react to a target changing positions.  It takes a few tenths of a second for a human to realize that something has moved then you have to begin trying to track the object.  You will also notice that humans tend to oversteer when tracking objects.  You make rapid movements trying to get close to the object, then you gradually adjust the amount of movement making it smaller and smaller until you are again on target.

You could do this with bots as well.  Whenever the bot starts tracking something it could use a fairly large delta value in adjusting the aim (say 10 degrees per frame).  Then once the reticle has gone past the enemy (overshoot), change the delta value to a smaller number (say 7 degrees) and continue aiming back in the other direction.  When the bot has once again gone past the target, change the aiming delta to 5 degrees and try to target again.  And so on and so on until you are "on target" again.

As long as the enemy keeps moving, the bot would keep resetting (or just increasing) the aiming delta value until it reached some upper limit (say 10 degrees).

I believe that this would simulate the way a human being aims fairly well.  Obviously 2 factors that would effect the aiming are reaction time, and how quickly the overshoot on the aiming is reduced.
