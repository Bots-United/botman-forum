MingW32 is a Windows compiler, so you cannot compile for Linux using MingW32.  Best bet is sticking with your Linux box.

The HPB bot template code is a stripped down version of the Beta 4.2 release of the HPB bot.

I removed all of my navigation code and replaced it with stubb functions (see BotFindWaypoint and BotHeadTowardWaypoint in the bot_navigate.cpp file).

All you need to build the Linux version of the HPB bot template source code is a Linux box with the gcc compiler installed.  There is a makefile included in the HPB bot template called "makefile_linux".  Just rename this to "makefile" and run "make" on your Linux box to build the .so shared library.
