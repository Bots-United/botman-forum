Hi..

Can we calculate how far the bot move? I assume the max speed(270) means that the bot move 270 units in a sec. Is that right?

you'll need the bots current speed... i.e. 

pBot->f_move_speed

The "forward speed" you pass into pfnRunPlayerMove() will determine how fast the bot moves during each frame.  Remember that you have more than 1 frame per second (well I hope you have anyway!).  If you want to know how far the bot moved since the previous frame, you should store the origin in one frame and then compare that to the origin in the next frame (the HPB bot does this using the "v_prev_origin" field to store the origin before it calls pfnRunPlayerMove.  You can then use (origin-v_prev_origin).Length() to determine the distance between the current origin and the previous origin to know how far the bot moved during the last frame.
