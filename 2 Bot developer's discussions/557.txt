I explain the problem : now, my bots can defuse the bomb planted. I have just a problem : when I throw a smokegrenade and when the bomb is also planted, Counter-Terrorists can't make the difference between the bomb planted and the smokegrenade which is on the floor...

How can I find the difference between them ? I know the name of the entity is both "grenade", but I can't find how to know which if it is a smole or the bomb...

Please help me !!!!

It isn't "smole" but "smoke"...

You could for example try to compare the actual model-name with the one you desire.
Example:
if ((strncmp("grenade", item_name, 7) == 0) && (FStrEq(STRING(pent->v.model), "models/w_c4.mdl")) )

This way you would know it's a C4...

Hope this helps.

It seems that you made an error Count Floyd : instead of your code, I use that and that works now :

strcpy(model_name, STRING(pent->v.model));
if ((strcmp("grenade", item_name) == 0 && strcmp("models/w_c4.mdl"), model_name) )
{
  .....
}

Thanks for the help man ! Now, I understand how to make the difference between entities... Keep the good work !

I don't see much of a difference between your code and mine. Your doing a strcpy into a charstring and I'm doing a direct compare, that's all. Btw. while we're at bug hunting:
I think you've got 1 bracket too much in your example post. I would think your line should look like this:
if((strcmp("grenade", item_name) == 0) && (strcmp("models/w_c4.mdl", model_name)))

...and if you don't put the = = like this...

 && (strcmp("models/w_c4.mdl", model_name)==0)

...you'll get the opposite effect (i.e. strings NOT equal).

Yes botman, I made a mistake when I made my last post : I omised to put == 0 but I made that in my bots, and that works...

Thanks too botman :)
