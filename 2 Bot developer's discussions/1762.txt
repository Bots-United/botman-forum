To disguise in TFC, the player sends a command to the server.  The easiest way to find this command with the HPB bot is to use the "debug_engine" command on the console.  When you enter debug_engine on the console it starts logging information to a file in the Half-Life folder called "bot.txt".

Join the game as a spy and select the disguise command on the VGUI menu.  After you have disguised exit the game.  Edit the bot.txt file in the Half-Life directory and search for "ClientCommand".  You will find the command that was sent from your client to the server when you selected the disguise option on your VGUI menu.

You can use the FakeClientCommand() function included with the HPB bot template source to cause the bot to send this same command when you want the bot to disguise.

You can put this code in whatever function makes the most sense to you.  For example if you want to disguise while in combat, you might put it in bot_combat.cpp.  To disguise while navigating, you might put it in bot_navigate.cpp.  You might also want to just randomly disguise every once in while and put the code in bot.cpp.  It's totally up to you.
