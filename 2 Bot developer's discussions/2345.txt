So far I've added in my bot's chat- & name-file, the ability to ignore #-comments, etc. and in the chat text-file the [Killed], [Killer] headers like in Jumbot & POD bot's chatting files to specify what the bot should say at certain times. Those parts work and when the bot dies, it talks, but how can I show the message of a bot that is stalking or attacking another bot, and how can I find the victim's name?

I'm using Botman's HPB Bot, not the Mod bot.

I would appreciate it if anyone replies to this thread.

Thanks for reading.

The DeathMsg network message includes the killer index and the victim index (so that all players will know who was the killer and who was the victim).

See the BotClient_Valve_DeathMsg() function in bot_client.cpp of the HPB bot template source code for an example of intercepting this message and determining who is the killer and who is the victim.
