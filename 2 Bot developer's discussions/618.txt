This may just be my imagination...
I looked in my Bot.cpp to find what caused a freak out problem and it turned out it was this in dll.cpp by mistake...

if (User->PC->Model == OLD)
{
      BotThink
}
else
{
      Fire, die, spaz, shoot, swear and scream
}

How could botman not spot this mistake in his original bot code releases? :)

Nah

Seriously.

Whenever I add bots in CS before joining a team and wait more than ten seconds they freak out.

What is wrong with them?

If I restart HL fully and join a team first everything runs great.

It crashes because CS is resetting the FAKECLIENT-flag faster than you can set it... Try to put a pev->flags I= FAKECLIENT; (something like that) at the start AND the end of your BotThink function. Botman sets this flag only once at the beginning of the function. I added the same directly before every return-statement in BotThink and it worked fine. Found that out last night, so I didn't post it yet... Maybe someone else has another solution as well?
