=). Find a tool called PeBrowse so you can open any DLL and find out weapons, items and anything the MOD uses. 
-------------------------------------------------
This was posted from you. Where can I download that PeBrowss?

Hey,

I uploaded it to: http://www.geocities.com/borg_clan/PEBROWSE.ZIP
-Note: Dont click it! Right click & choose "Save as"

i hope you get it from Geo, it can be pain sometimes.  You can try Google or Askjeeves to find it...Just use PeBrowse as the search word,
But if you have Visual C++ Then you have a tool called: DumpBin that does the same.

Run this from an MS-DOS window...

dumpbin /exports mp.dll > mod.txt

Then edit mod.txt with any text editor and delete the symbol names that begin with '?'.  What you should have left is a list of map entities.  Just add them to linkfunc.cpp like the other shown there.

As a side note, it still amazes me that so many people in the "Windows generation" have never done anything in an MS-DOS window.  Everyone thinks that the way programs should ALWAYS be run is to double-click on them.  Give me a good ol' command line interface over a GUI anyday!
