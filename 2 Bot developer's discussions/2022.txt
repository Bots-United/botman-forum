For some reason my Bots shoot at me when I am in Spectator mode, I tried changing BotFindEnemy but it doesn't seem to be working...  If someone could point me in the right direction?  Thanks, see ya people...

Spectator mode can be determined by either seeing if the pleyer is not on a valid team, or doing some check in the 'iuser1' varible ofthe player entity, you wil have to find out what iuser value means spectating (I think its 1) and what means not spectating (I think 0).

ARGH!!  I tried everything, checking teams, the iuser (not sure if I did that one right) and everything else I can think of...  Ahhhhh!!

Are you using something like this to determine if the player is alive (and thus should be shot at)?...
code:
bool IsAlive(edict_t *pEdict)
{
   return ((pEdict->v.deadflag == DEAD_NO) &&
           (pEdict->v.health > 0) &&
           !(pEdict->v.flags & FL_NOTARGET) &&
           (pEdict->v.takedamage != 0));
}

This checks the deadflag to see if they aren't dead, checks the health to make sure they are alive, checks the NOTARGET flag and the takedamage setting which can indicate if they are in observer mode or not.

Ok, I think I fixed it, I was calling my BotFindMonsters function and it had a little error in it...  All better now, thanks for your help!

If youre trying to use the botfindmonsters function to find monsters in TFC, which there arnt any! ;) Just say for example

code:

if (mod_id != TFC_DLL)
{
 if(pBot->pBotEnemy == NULL)
  pBot->pBotEnemy = BotFindMonsters(pBot);

}
