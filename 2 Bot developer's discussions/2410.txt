I compiled Realbot on Linux (Suse 7.2 - sorry ;) .. I copied everything over, renamed makefile_linux to makefile, edited it so all new objects are compiled as well, deleted *.o, it compiled, I copied the .so to cstrike/dlls/, edited the liblist.gam and started hl .. now this is what happened:

LoadLibrary failed on /usr/local/halflife/hlds_l/cstrike/dlls/realbot_i486.so: /
usr/local/halflife/hlds_l/cstrike/dlls/realbot_i486.so: undefined symbol: sin
Host_Error: Couldn't get DLL API from /usr/local/halflife/hlds_l/cstrike/dlls/re
albot_i486.so!
Error Host_Error: Couldn't get DLL API from /usr/local/halflife/hlds_l/cstrike/d
lls/realbot_i486.so!


I tried several things, but I guess it just compiled wrong. Can anyone help me on this? I'm not very experienced with linux, but learning ..

TIA

"sin" is the math sin() function.

You'll need to add "-lm" to the link command in the makefile.  Change this...

"${CPP} -fPIC -shared -o $@ ${OBJ} -ldl"

...to this...

"${CPP} -fPIC -shared -o $@ ${OBJ} -ldl -lm"

...and it shouldn't complain about "undefined symbol: sin" anymore.

oh dear.. my thoughts were "sin" ? I don't know "sin" .. damn :)

Thanks for your help, the server does start now. Although it crashes when I disconnect from the server.. I guess I'll have to go hunt some bugs.

use...

gdb hlds_run core

(gdb) where

...to find out what function it's crashing in.

Any chance I can get my hands on the Realbot code, or the Linux dll that you have.  I'm dying to get a decent bot on my Linux server.

absolutely NO chance to get the source!
You'll get the rb: ai linux dll when rb: ai is done.
rb: ai is still in an early beta stage, you wouldn't want to use it permanently anyway.

You're not the first one who asks me about a linux dll, but before it's good enough, nothing will be released.
