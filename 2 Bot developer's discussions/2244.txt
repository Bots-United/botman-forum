Is there a way to find out if the current weapon of an edict is zoomed?

Another question:
How do you make bots drop weapons?

I don`t know much about counter strike but
you could check the pEdict->v.fov variable.
It`s values ranges from 0 - not zoomed to 90 - way too zoomed. This might be reversed.
Check crosbow.cpp in the HLSDK for example.

About dropping weapons: i`m pretty sure there`s
a 'dropweapon' client command you could issue.

Hope it helped...
