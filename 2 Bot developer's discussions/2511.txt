If "+bhurston" is a command, just use the FakeClientCommand() function to send this command to "hold" the button down.  Use FakeClientCommand() with "-bhurston" to "let go" of the button.

I really dont know what u mean...

But i can make the bot hold the buttom but i dont know where to put it? I have made waypoints for the RUNWAY... I am working on a new navigation system.. The navi system that i have now is perfect but it is made for Basic Half-Life mods...

You should set in your mod to send a message to the client when the player is on the ground, hasn't taken off basicly

then you intersept the messages and if its that esage then they are on the ground, so in the bot think make it use that command, and start taking off...but its easier creating a bit on the user, like forward and add that to the bot when you want it to take off...

btw Air HL kicks ass :)
