I already searched the forums and can't find this.
How do i give the bots name from an external file?
I am aware of how to open a file but how do i get TFC to recognize the names in those files?

thx

You use that name when you create the bot in the BotCreate() function.  Just change both places where you see the string "Bot" (once in CREATE_FAKE_CLIENT and once in ClientConnect) to whatever name you want to use.

yeah, i know. but i mean how do i get random names like your bots from a file? like bot_name.txt and have a list of bot name that the game will open and give the bots?

Hi Justin,
Just read all of the names in the file into an array. (Or a LL if you're feeling game:) and just choose a random one. In BotCreate() :
change:
"Bot"
to:
botnames[RANDOM_LONG(0,num_names)]

too easy

I don't get it. Where's the BotCreate()?

It's one of the first functions in bot.cpp!!

For some reason my bot's still work with random names even though I only use "bot" for the name in ClientConnect. Their names in the game come from the BotEnt = CREATE_FAKE_CLIENT( "botname" ) part

So for example, if i want my bots to be named Killer and Murderer, i change it to killer,murderer[RANDOM_LONG(0,num_names)]??

No, you need to learn more about arrays in C/C++.  You would want to define an array of character arrays OR an array of pointers to character arrays.  To define an array of character arrays you would do this...

char names[5][32];

That would define an array of 5 names each of which is 31 characters (plus the null terminator) long.  To initialize this array you could do this...

strcpy(names[0], "BigBot");
strcpy(names[1], "Butthead");
strcpy(names[2], "Jumbug");
strcpy(names[3], "TwiddleDee");
strcpy(names[4], "TwiddleDum");

The to pick one at random you could use this...

char bot_name[32];

strcpy(bot_name, names[RANDOM_LONG(0, 4)]);

Then the character array "bot_name" would contain one of the 5 preinitialized names.

Get a book on C and/or C++ and read about arrays.

At first type "www.amazon.com" in your favourite web-browser, then "c++" in the search-field. Chose a book that you like and press the "Order" button :-)
Seriously, there is *NO* way getting around learning C if you want to program a bot. Take your time and enjoy.

I have learned this to. it is nesscery to know alot of this stuff. i did go out and buy another book to read about c and c++ so im hoping it helps. most of the time i just screw around with things until i get it to work like i want. bad idea if you have no patience. hehe

Gen[X] - It is well worth taking a few weeks to learn C before trying to make a bot - you'll save a lot of time because you will understand things better, so you'll be able to bugfix things faster and if you have any new ideas, you will at least know how to start implementing it without having to 'screw around' so much.

First, an apology for nitpicking. And it isn't a good solution if you really read names from file.

Now the content. You probably mean:

const char names[] = { "Bitbot", Butthead", "Jumbug", "etc." };
const int  nrofnames = sizeof(names)/sizeof(char*);

char bot_name[32];

strcpy(bot_name, names[rand() % nrofnames]);

C++ (C?) does have a great facility for dealing with arrays of constants. There's no need to write additional initialization code, and you don't risk forgetting it after extending the list of names.
