I still can't store and restore viewing/aiming angles. Could someone please finish the following code ?

<bunch of code cutted out>

// Some variables for storing
Vector Angles [5];

void ClientCommand( edict_t *pEntity )

  if ((gpGlobals->deathmatch) && (!IS_DEDICATED_SERVER()))
   {
      const char *pcmd = Cmd_Argv(0);
      const char *arg1 = Cmd_Argv(1);
      const char *arg2 = Cmd_Argv(2);
      const char *arg3 = Cmd_Argv(3);
      const char *arg4 = Cmd_Argv(4);

      if (FstrEq (pcmd, "test_store")) {
      // store the viewing/aiming angles here
      }

      if (FstrEq (pcmd, "test_restore")) {
      // restore the viewing/aiming angles here
      }

   (*other_gFunctionTable.pfnClientCommand)(pEntity);
}

<another bunch of code cutted out>

what part is it that needs to be finished? Is it the code for the if statements?

The rest of the code is fine (except the missing compund statement st the start ! :-D I think you probably had it in anyway!, but because of copying/pasting took it out ;-) )

oh, Are you trying to store the bots angle its facing? If youve got any more of your posts around about this I'll have a look!

Hmmm. Thought it was quite easy to figure out what wasn't finished:

if (FstrEq (pcmd, "test_store")) {
     // store the viewing/aiming angles here
     }

(as you see, this command does nothing)

if (FstrEq (pcmd, "test_restore")) {
     // restore the viewing/aiming angles here
     }

(as you see..)

I think its important to say that its not a bot but a human player which I try to store/restore angles for.

This thread is kinda related to this:

How do you want to store the angles (in memory, in a file on disk, etc.)?

When you set a player's angles you should make sure to set pev->fixangle to TRUE so that the engine will update the angles during the next frame.

I know that botman. It does change the angles but it is still not right.

Actually, its the look up/down angle which isn't correctly restored.

When its restored, the player is aiming somewhat lower compared to when it was stored.

I store it a file but it should not make any difference.

What I'm looking for is just some code which works.

Maybe, look at the stuff in the BotFixIdealPitch function. I think your angle might be slightly off because its been "rotated" a different way you would expect. See that code maybe. to fix it.... :-/
