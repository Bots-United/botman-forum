If you have Microsoft Visual C++ you simply need to set up your environment properly.  There will be a file called "VCVARS32.BAT" in the bin directory of whereever you installed the compiler.  Run that batch file to set up the environment in your MS-DOS window then just use "cl exports.c" to build export.exe.

To answer your original question, to build exports.c using the Borland compiler, you will need to set up the compiler environment (you can copy the bcc32.cfg and ilink32.cfg files from the HPB bot template source into your Borland\bcc55\bin directory).  Then just use the following MS-DOS command...

bcc32 exports.c

...and it will build the exports.exe file.

For further information on using Borland to build applications (especially Windows apps), you should visit this web page...
