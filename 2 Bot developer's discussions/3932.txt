Hi I seem to have trouble with the bots I am doing with climbing ladders.

Lets say a bot is at the bottom of the ladder..

I set their angle correctly, (look up) so that's pev->v_angle -89 right? 

Also set their angles.x to -89.0 / 3 (aiming fix?) 

And of course set their button to IN_FORWARD

All they do now is stay still, you can hear the ladder step sounds but the dont move, all the do is look up with their legs moving on the spot!

Now here is the weird bit, by decreasing my fps to very low (by looking somewhere fram inetensive like outside the map, so the fps drops low) the bot will suddenly walk up the ladder properly

Now all I am wondering is what is wrong? can it be a time thing I have set somewhere? Or has it got to do with the bots msec value? Thanks :P

I would bet you have a crappy aim code ;D

Try making your bot reach a ladder on which it can climb DOWN. I would not be surprised that your bot looks up and climbs down. ;)

Why wouldn't you just write a cool aim code so that you wouldn't bother with these bugs ? i.e, make the aim code be called once and only once per frame, at the end, to make the bot turn in the direction of its idealangles, and adapt the body angles accordingly. Then, all you need to touch in your code is the ideal angles. Never touch the view or body angles several times a frame, it's no good at all ! :)

Edited: have a look at my botaim_mm metamod plugin source code to see a working aiming code without the pile of bugs we usually carry around : http://www.racc-ai.com/botaim_mm.exe

yeah I'd love to do aiming per frame instead of instantaneuosly :P thanks for the link it will come in useful :P
