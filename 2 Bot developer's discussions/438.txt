How can the bomb location be determined?

It makes me go crazy!!!!

I try to get them defusin, but to no avail.

I must have to hook a message, but the file with the debug stuff in is huge.

No, you don't need to hook a message. Just use the bomb as an item the Bot wants to pick up. This means you can find the C4 by doing a "FindEntityInSphere". From then it's up to you what the Bot is doing (running to that location, pressing IN_USE etc.). It's btw. tricky to get the optimal distance for defusing, that's why my Bots will always duck when doing so (seems to work better).

Hope this helps...

Hey Dark Youth, if you're talking about the "search" command in dll.cpp, you'll have to change that so that it prints out things WITH an owner.  It currently checks the entity to make sure that it's not owned by anyone (to prevent your weapons that you are carrying from showing up).

I'll bet that the C4 is owned by the player that planted it, thus you don't see it with the "search" command.

I already noticed.

I found it when I altered the range setting and saw that b*st*rd little line with the owner thing.

It turns out the bomb is a grenade.

Hey, it's ok Auxois ! Please take a seat, calm down and don't ever think of taking those pills again :)

DarkYouth:
Yes, it's a grenade. So there's only the problem left to separate a C4 Grenade from a HE Grenade flying at you. But I'm sure you'll find that out very soon :)
