Quick question. I've nearly finished the code for spys, but I need to check what colour their skin is.. I tried using pBot->pEdict.v.colourmap (or simialr) and it only seems to return 0...
Arg!
If anyones got the answer please let me know :))
(Spy backstab comming up :) )

P.S. Expect my next release on saturday (hopefully with a better site). The bots are rather mean now, if you don't find them hard to kill you must be l33t :) hehe

Hi,

the info you want is stored in the client's infokeybuffer.

that should be enough for you to figure it out :).

I want it, but I'm not going to be lazy :)

I'm always just getting my answers from the forum :( , I think I'm being too lazy.

All the questions that I want to ask have basically been asked by DarkYouth, the only problem I have is bugfixing the source at the moment.

Currently I'm adding a 'Missions' ability to my bot, to enable them, to truly act as a team!! Other TFC bots probably do this too, but a bot will not attempt to do something if if is already being done by another bot (eg get a dropped flag/defend your own flag). And when I find out how to get bots to understand text messages properly, I can get them to communicate and tell each other where the flag is (or the player can tell them where it is) like in Quake 3!! My current problem is that the WaypointFindRandomGoal/WaypointFindNearGoal functions don't seem to find waypoints with the flags that I am specifying, when they worked b4!! But at least I'm having fun making my bot and learning about bugfixing :)

"TEAMbot Alpha 2 - TFC edition" may be out soon, or I may wait until I have put in some CS 'Mission' logic into my bots.

I can't do FLF mission logic as I don't have FLF yet :( - so if anyone could tell me the FLF mission goals that would be nice (and also tell me what waypoint flags are used for capture points and things on each team). I think that if I simply got each player to go to a random capture point it might work... I'm probably going to work out a system where each capture point has a different value so that the bots know which capture point is already defended/has been captured.

Good luck to all u other BotMakers!! Sorry if u don't want to hear my status reports, but as I'm going to be releasing the source, I thought some of u might like to know what I'll be doing. I don't mind if u use some of my code/copy my ideas, but it would be nice if u mentioned me in your readmes!!

I'll drop hint if u want :))

it involves 
pfnGetInfoKeyBuffer
and
topcolor (this being a variable from pfnGetInfoKeyBuffer)

and just for reference
blue team(0) == 150
red team(1) == 250
yellow team(2) == 45
green team(3) == 100

:)
If you can't work it out from this, you may need a bit more practice at general programming (not to be offencive :) )
Everything u need is here

Haha, I didn't really say I wanted it. I would be able to work it out without much problem, but at the moment I'm trying to get my nav code sorted out... I've added in so much at the same time (for my 'Mission' code), that I'm not very sure where the crash is occuring... it doesn't seem to be happening in a specific place, so I'm wondering if these another memory bug somewhere in Botman's code

I won't really take offence at anything u say, but I'm fairly well aquainted with finding out value and things by now :)

Looks like I'm going to have to put bugfixing code in EVERY part of my new code if I'm going to find the problem, lol
