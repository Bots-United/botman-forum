For some reason func_plat entities don't work when you walk on them while using my bot for some reason. I don't have any more info on this though! The thing is that plats that usually work (like the one in undertow that leads to the button to raise the water... and the plat in DMC dm2 near the rocket launcher USUALLY work) But they don't move at all with my bot for some reason!!! :(

I'm maybe wondedring if any one else has these problems... or any possible cause?

Are you searching for func_plat entities anywhere is your code?  Perhaps you have some code that is resetting one of the func_plat entity fields when you don't mean to be (i.e. you have "=" somewhere when you meant it to be "==").

If you are doing anything with "func_plat", try commenting out that code and see if they start working again.

Aha! I found it out. I had some places where I returned from the DispatchTouch is some things were null e.g. classname or edict. Obviously the func_plats didn't like it :(

I removed those lines and they work now :)
