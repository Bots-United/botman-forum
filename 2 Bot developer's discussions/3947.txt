i'm limiting the maximum bots to the total of info_player_start and info_player_deathmatch for CS, but i find it's still possible to add a playing player/bot since it is shown on the scoreboard as one of team members and they do get spawned sometimes, not sure why, but they usually killed by worldspawn on the next round. is this normal? anyone else has this bug ?

and also i (as a player) can't change to spectator after i join the game (even after the round ends) and had to restart the round (sv_restartround 1) to do this. anyone knows which function is called (for switching to spectator) and perhaps why ?

1. Yes, it is.
The HL engine supports up to 32 players, and doesn't restrict this count to the number of spawn points present in the map. The reason is that you could as well play HLDM with 31 of your buddies on a map that has only 4 spawn points. And provided all the people don't get killed at the same moment, it would work perfectly well. Actually it's round-based games (TFC, CS) that are the exception here.

2. Nothing possible that I know.
The way CS handles spectators and VGUI menu is completely messy. I haven't found a single rule on which I could see the game stick to about that. All happens like if the players were authorized/refused to join spectator in a totally random way. No clue, but if you find one, I'd be curious to know it as well.
