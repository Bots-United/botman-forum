Did you know that ?
code:

   PRECACHE_SOUND ("dummy/blah.wav");


this works, but
code:

   sprintf (path, "dummy/%s/blah.wav", sub_path);
   PRECACHE_SOUND (path);


this doesn't.

Don't dream, the paths are corrects, the files all exist.

Rather annoying... I have wrote all the stuff to retrieve the locale language of the Half-Life installation, and I wish I could have precached different sound samples according to that...

PRECACHE_SOUND() gets angry if I feed it with a variable. An idea ?

if i understood right you are trying to precache different files above ? ok, just asking ...

That reminds me of an error I had some time ago ... I had a similar situation and the mistake was a \n at the end of sub_path ...

nope, there isn't any...
What did you do exactly ? I'd like to be certain that PRECACHE_SOUND() can be passed other stuff than pure constants...

there isn't exactly a "sub_path" required is there?

The strings are different cos u put a subpath between "dummy" and "blah.wav"

Yes, it is. You didn't understand.

I want to precache my OWN sounds. My bots talk during the game. Currently they are talking in French, but I want to make them able to talk the language of the player. For that, I am parsing the sierra.inf file at the root of the Half-Life directory to find out the language of the current HL install, then I use this data to precache different sound samples that correspond to the language.

There should be no problems in using a character array as the file path and name instead of hard coding it.

You need to make sure that the sounds are recorded in the proper format (11Khz, 8 bit mono or 22Khz, 8 bit mono).  Other than that you can use whatever you like for the pathname (just don't include the "sound\" part since Half-Life adds this to the beginning of all sound files anyway.

Yeah sure, but currently it doesn't work. The sounds are OK. I can't figure out why this ###### function doesn't want to eat my variable. The Half-Life engine error message shows that this variable (the sound path) gets completely messed up at precache time.

I'm turning mad...

If it gets completely messed up make sure the text is small enough to fit in the sub_path string... also make sure it is a string! ;D It's probably another one of these simple errors that doesn't want to be found :)

Just try this at home, cheesy:
code:

   char sndpath[256];
   sprintf (sndpath, "barney/guyresponsible.wav");
   PRECACHE_SOUND (sndpath);


...and see if it works!
Here's what the HL engine tells me at run time:
QUOTE:

BUILD 1786 SERVER (0 CRC)
Server # 1
Warning:  Unable to open sound/ for transfer
SV_ReadClientMessage: unknown command char (33)
processing sound/
]

maybe the string you pass is not copied by the engine, but used later on. You'd have to keep the string in memory then.

try to make the string a global var.. like


char soundpath[256];

void precache_stuff()
{
  sprintf(soundpath, "barney/guyresponsible.wav");
  PRECACHE_SOUND (soundpath);
}


I didn't test this, just guessing.

Nice thought! It works!
Thanks a lot 8)

btw I didn't understand why that variable has to be global.
...erm... PRECACHE_SOUND() execution would be delayed, then your PrecacheStuff() function would exit too early and destroy the local variable ? That's the only explanation I find...

aaaargh!!!

In fact no, it does NOT work!!!
The engines keep quiet at run-time and reports no error, but when I try an EMIT_SOUND_DYN2() with the name of one of the precached sounds, the servers tells me that:
QUOTE:

SV_StartSound:  ../../racc/talk/french/firstspawn/firstspawn4.wav not precached (0)




Damnit!

make sure you do NOT change the string after calling PRECACHE_SOUND. Use a different var for ever sound you want to precache.

I'm precaching about 70 sound samples for my bot audio chat system. Do you mean I have to declare about 70 different char arrays of about 60 bytes each ?

yes. As said, if the engine wants to access the string later on, it has to be kept in memory. That's why you shouldn't overwrite it.

Valve uses ALLOC_STRING() to "permanently" allocate string space.  This will only be good for the current map.  When a new map is loaded, you will have to ALLOC_STRING() the string space again.

Creating a static array in memory is the easiest way around this problem.

OK, I'll try this.

(damn, my DLL's memory consumption increases again and again... a few kilobytes here, a few kilobytes there...)

Thank you all.
