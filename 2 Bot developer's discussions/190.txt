I've just release a Test Version of my BJLbot I just started working on.

No navigation code yet since I just started but I add some code to let the medics Heal you.  I haven't got anything in there for them to respond to the (Medic! Calling Key 'Z') but if they see that you have less than 100 health they'll heal you.

That's it try it out download from the link below:
