Hello all

As I've said this morning, a new version of my bot is available to download at http://perso.libertysurf.fr/pm0001

I assume this version will be the first, in terms of big public releases.

The PMBot is my own sausage with the HPB template. It supports HL, CS, OpFor, DMC and TFC. CS bots plant/defuse bombs, buy stuff, throw grenades... ; overall bot skill in combat has been improved : they can either attack or fire at distant range, they strafe when firing and sometimes use circle-fire.

For the navigation part, it is *ALL UNWAYPOINTED*, but I really think you should give it a try ; what is achieved here is periodic sampling of each bot's field of view to make the bot represents his environment in real-time like a human player and choose the best direction to go. For example i was playing cs_italy half an hour ago, and I saw a teammate bot successfully rushing across the mansion, crossing its different rooms without stopping and even hurting a wall. I was following it and he crossed this mansion exactly as fast as I would have did it. It works pretty well in its early stages, but I NEED FEEDBACK!!

Also, bots don't fall anymore in pits or don't jump down the mountains no more... They identify potentially dangerous gaps exactly like a wall, and are able to "turn" at it, just like Botman's BotTurnAtWall() function does it for walls.

Teamplay bots can be given orders by VGUI menu or keyboard shortcuts, to make them keep a position, follow us or roam by themselves. The bot follow-user code works well too, they are able to follow you on ladders for example. They react when you are firing at an enemy they don't see yet and they never pause facing a wall and always choose a better visibility angle.

I am proud of the chat system too. In deathmatch mode, bots randomly quit/join the server, and their minimum and maximum number can be dynamically set-up from the console. They say hello when they come in, goodbye when they leave, they complain if they don't see an enemy for a certain amount of time, they laugh at you when you die and they reply if one laugh after having killed one of them. Furthermore, in TFC and CS they can ask for help, acknowledge or refuse orders, and *really chat* on the radio! Not simply using standard radio commands, about 70 original sound samples are precached in game for bot radio experience!! They can so yell in your ears if they see a grenade, ask for emergency backup, ask for reports and report in... they really talk on the radio and reply to each other.

What is totally untested is the "making bots issue special commands" in TFC, like building a dispenser, a sentry gun, detonate plastic or so... Those orders can be accessed by the VGUI menu too.

The bot is Open-Source, Free Software and under the Berkeley license. You can do anything you want with my source code (which is based on Botman's...).

You can see a list of what has been achieved on http://perso.libertysurf.fr/pm0001/changelog.html

Very few people know it. I really need feedback. Please give it a try !!

Just e-mail me. We won't disturb Botman, that's his forum.
