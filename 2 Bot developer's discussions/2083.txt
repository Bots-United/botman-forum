hi there,

I'm coding on some new npc's for a german H-L Mod,
well, everything works perfect..BUT I can't give them 2 Features at once:
Shooting and following!

If they're able to shoot at enemys, they don't follow me, if I try to USE them, If they can follow me, they can't shoot.

In the bots-code I have the shooting.code and the following-shedule, they are CLASS_PLAYER_ALLY TalkMonsters, so they donÄt shoot at me.

But now I don't know, how I can explain them, that they have to follow me, besause I'm the boss!

ObjectCabs, and the follow-shedule part at GetScheduleOfType I've also inculded!

I didn't forgett any folllow part, there is the same following.code like the barney has.

Well, I need help! :)
Does anybody know, what to do? 

(I know, that here are a lot of mistakes..my english sucks hard. please try to ignore them..:))

(the modells are: hgrunt.mdl & hgrunt_medic.mdl (op4ce))

well, you could try to mix the barney code with the follow / attack code of HPB_template #3, or just use the template code. I use a modified version of it on my bot and it works very well.

<<oops... forgot something>>>
bots can`t shoot what they cant see... when barney follows you in HL he only shoots monsters he sees so you could make the bots turn around once in a while to check if it sees something.

HPB_Bot template #3 is the base for 99% of the bots currently available today. you can found all about it in the projects section in botman`s site.

since you are making bots for your own code, try bot_10 source code (look in the same above place).
