Did somebody already try out his Bot with the leaked HL Updates ? Well, I did sort of and there seems to be some odd change with TE_BEAMPOINTS most of us use for displaying waypoints. They appear very dark in the game and if you shoot they get lighted. Now is this weird or what ? I already tried different combos in the parameters but changing brightness,r,g,b whatever didn't change anything. I'm confused, what about you ?

you must have done something, thats for sure, don't you think?
when did this happen, after what changes did this happen?

Sounds like using the triangle api in gouraud-shaded mode: The colors that I specify for my polygons/lines are ignored as well and change randomly when I change my view-angle or shoot at something. And that still with the old HL-version...
Btw, are you displaying the same number of waypoints as before the error ocurred? If you create too many temporal entities you can get some pretty weird effects as well.

"did you do anything in order to make this happpen? you must have done something, thats for sure, don't you think?"

No, it's my untouched V2.5 code which worked previously all of the times.

Yes certainly. Hey Klobby ! :)

Well, I'm not using the TriApi. TE_BEAMPOINTS takes a Sprite Index and some additional Parameters like Color & Alpha. The Sprite's the right one, but the colors aren't. I also did try out different combos and changed the values around but it didn't make a difference. Might be that they forgot to reset a drawing mode in the engine. I'll have a look.

Yes, I know. Thing is that there wasn't a change in the number of waypoints nor in my code and it did work well previously. It's also broken if I just display 1 beampoint. The weirdest part about it is that they get lighted everytime I'm shooting (and not only the ones which get lighted by the muzzle flash but all of them!).
