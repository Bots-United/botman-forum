Arghh I hate these errors... "gremlins" have got in my code this time and keep changing the ZERO index of my array, the array is fine when it leaves the function and then after a while different text somehow goes into it.

I'm making a bot chat keyword response thing, I store the chat lines in an array under each keyword.

code:

#define MAX_KEYWORD_LENGTH      32
#define MAX_KEYWORDS            80
#define MAX_LINES               8
#define MAX_CHAT_LENGTH            80

typedef struct
{
    char chatline[MAX_CHAT_LENGTH];
}chatline_t;

typedef struct
{
      char keyword[MAX_KEYWORD_LENGTH];
    chatline_t chatline[MAX_LINES];
} keywords_t;



I've made a file and it parses it all correctly, the zero index keyword had "rocket crowbot"  in it (which is right) and everything else went into the correct places although after a while (whilst debugging) I found out that the first keyword change to "the server bot..." lol... obviously somewhere "the server" got into my keyword string but how? I searched all my code for "the server" and all I got where comments on the code. After another while about the time it stops changing, the keyword changed to "ute  erver  ot" ... HMMM What the hell???

Is there any way I can make the program HALT and take me back to debugging if a certain memory location is changed?

Aha! I know what it is know... it's my bot.cfg of all things.. I had lines that were quite long and what do you know, the lines had "to <b>the server</b>" and "exec<b>ute</b>" in them... hehe

could it have been this part in ProcessBotCfgFile?

code:

      while ((cmd_line[cmd_index] != ' ') && (cmd_line[cmd_index] != 0))
            cmd_index++;



I added a (cmd_index < 256) also just incase
