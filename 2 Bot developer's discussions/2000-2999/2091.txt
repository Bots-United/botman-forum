You need to understand C++ inheritance (the Half-Life SDK uses lots of inheritance of classes).

All of the Half-Life classes inherit from the CBaseEntity class (see cbase.h for class member variables and functions).  The weapons are CBasePlayerWeapon which inherits from CBasePlayerItem (both defined in weapons.h).  Players are CBasePlayer (which inherit from CBaseMonster) and are defined in the player.h file.

All entities in Half-Life have a pointer to and edict structure.  This structure contains things like origin (in the world), view angle, health, frags, etc.  See the engine\progdefs.h file for the entvars_t structure that the class variable "pev" points to.

Understanding all of those should help you with about 80% of the SDK code.
