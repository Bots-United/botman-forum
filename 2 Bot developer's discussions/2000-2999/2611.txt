Has anyone noticed that sometimes you are in the menus, and all of a sudden you can't get ne more menus agian..

This needs to be fixed, lots of people get lost, and have problems...ask questions, etc...

It happens in PODBot, Admin mod, probley all other bots also

I don't know the exact cause of the error, but i think it might be CS Clearing menus but yours isn't being cleared, so may i suggest that you hook the ShowMenu message and make it something like this

code:

void Hooked_ShowMenu(edict_t *ed, void *p)
{
   static int state = 0;   // current state machine state

   if(state == 0 && !*(float *)p)
      UTIL_ShowMenu(ed, 0x00, 0, false, "");

   state++;
   if(state > 3)
     state = 0;
}



And to hook the messages do something like this to your pfnMessageBegin code...

code:

void pfnMessageBegin(int msg_dest, int msg_type, const float *pOrigin, edict_t *ed)
{
   if (gpGlobals->deathmatch)
   {
      int index = -1;

      if (debug_engine) { fp=fopen("bot.txt","a"); fprintf(fp,"pfnMessageBegin: edict=%x dest=%d type=%d\n",ed,msg_dest,msg_type); fclose(fp); }

      if (ed)
      {
         if (msg_type == message_ShowMenu)
           botMsgFunction = Hooked_ShowMenu;
    
     ...
}



Which would watch if there is a menu coming, and if there is it clears all current menus :)
