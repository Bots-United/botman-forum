I noticed with your bot on Op Force CTF that they appear to have no waypoints. Is this correct, or is it that the waypoints are a bit crap (no offence to whoever did them).

(I still had a good game on op4ctf_mortar though)

The only waypoint file included for OpFor is op4ctf_crash.  OpFor just lags so bad, it's not much fun to play.
