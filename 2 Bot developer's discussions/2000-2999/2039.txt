Is it possible to code a bot as a metamod plugin?  I want to be able to use other addons with  a bot, and metamod lets me do this.  I was taking a look at stub plugin, but theres 1 BIG problem i cant seem to figure out:  How to hook messages.  Hooking messages is ABSOLUTELY nessecary for my addon.  If anyone has experience with metamod coding, please tell me how to hook messages/engine functions, because in metamod your addon doesnt send GiveFnptrsToDll to the gameDLL, the actual metamod does.

Yes, it is possible. The first bot which has been implemented as a metamod plugin is FoxBot. The metamod version is due to be released soon. You can even code your bot to be used as a metamod plugin or as a standalone dll with the same binary. 

Will, the creator of metamod has converted the HPBbot into a metamod plugin but rather as an proof-of-concept than a fully functional bot. You can find the code at the metamod website. 

What "messages" do you want to hook? You can hook engine functions through metamod. Engine functions are passed to metamod plugins before they get called in the engine. The plugin can decide how to handle the function call. It can pass it on, cancel the call or override the return value (through post functions). The same is true in the other direction for API calls.

If you want to see metamod in action you can have a look at the adminmod sources. You can browse CVS at this link:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/halflifeadmin/admin_muck/hl/

Files of interest would be dll.cpp, h_export.cpp and admin_mod.cpp. It may be a bit confusing since the code still has the non-metamod code in addition to the metamod code. But the syntax coloring of the CVS web interface isn't bad.
