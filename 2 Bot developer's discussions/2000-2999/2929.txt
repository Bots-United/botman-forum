Cut-and-paste the source code from one bot into source code of another bot.  Make adjustments to function arguments and/or bot variables where necessary.

It would be essential that you have a strong understanding of C and/or C++ to do this effectively.

There are a large number of books for learning C++, but without "know-how" of C++ you will not have a possibility editing the source of a bot.
