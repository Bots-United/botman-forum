I`m trying to make my bot face a trigger_teleport
entity. 
The comment on BotFindItem says that bmodels have origin of 0,0,0 and VecBmodelOrigin() has to be used.
is it true also for 'trigger_' entities?

I tried it but it doesn`t work.
Normal pent->v.origin failes also.

Anyone aware of any sollution for this?

Thanks

Try ((pent->v.abs_max + pent->v.abs_min)/2) - that will work...

abs_min and abs_max give compile errors (not member of entvars_t something). I tried to replace them with startpos and endpos but that`s not working also (wrong origin).

maybe trigger_teleport is not the entity I should look for?

It's "absmin" and "absmax" without the underscore.
