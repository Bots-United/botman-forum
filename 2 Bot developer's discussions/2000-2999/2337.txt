When I run a server with only bots in it, everything works fine but if the listen server is playing, there is often a page fault in the bot's dll, especially when the listen server is buying stuff at round start (my bot is for CS)
I already checked all the strcpy, memset, new and delete funcs, message handlers, cleaned and rebuilt the entire project, reinstalled HL and CS but nothing worked
Is anyone has an idea on a possible location of the problem?

Build the Debug version of the DLL and start the game using the dedicated server.  This will allow you to run the bots within the MSVC debugger.  The debugger will catch where your invalid page fault is occuring which should lead you to the bug.

See this thread...

Ok I found it. The mistake was to assume that a weapon_ type of entity always had a owner edict (player or weaponbox) which is apparently wrong for the grenades the listenserver is buying.

The only annoying thing of this trick to debug while listenserver is playing is that you need a hell of a computer tu run MS debugger+hlds+hl at the same time.
Anyway, thanks a lot botman! Debugging will be a lot faster now :)
