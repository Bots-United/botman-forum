How do I have Bots sent over ClientCommands in a MOD (not using the hooking approach) ? The ordinary CLIENTCOMMAND() Function gives me instant crashes (probably because there isn't an argument buffer set up for Fakeclients in the engine) and the usual Fakeclient Function is not an option because I would have to rewrite most of the Client ClientCommand Function. Any suggestions ? I'm just about to rewrite parts of the HL Engine so please stop me before I screw up everything :)

Nevermind, there are only some commands need to be supported for Bots so I will just stick to the Fakeclientcommand approach...
Btw. I've just seen that the current engine code doesn't check for fakeclients when sending a Message right now, so you better check twice before trying a CLIENTCOMMAND() with Fakeclients.

I suspect that the previous versions of the engine don't do this either.  I believe that is why AdminMOD/Metamod have such problems with bots leading to crashes.  Admin/Meta don't check if the player is a fake client before sending network commands to the client.
