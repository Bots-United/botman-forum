In bot.h in the main bot structure there are some Vectors defined for origin etc, but how does the compiler know what theses are when there is no reference to them in bot.h? Might sound like a dumb question to some, but its got me stumped, because when i create a new file and define some Vectors in a struct, it says it's undefined.

Confused :/
I do know the basics of declarin prototypes etc. but this one is wierd, probably has a simple answer tho if anyone can provide it.

funnliy enough theres a file called Vector.h ;D which is included by the HL engine stuff (which is included by your bot!).

Yes i know, but theres no reference to that in bot.h. So how does it know about it? Where should i include my new file (with Vectors in it) so that the engine knows what Vectors are?

extdll.h includes vector.h.  Everything includes extdll.h (therefore everything also includes vector.h).
