Hi,

I get this error when I try to debug the Flamerbot for Action Half-life:

code:

Debug Assertion Failed!

Program: c:\games\half-life\hl.exe
File: fprintf.c
Line: 56
Expression: str != NULL

You can press: Abort, Retry and Ignore (They all don't work).



I tried debugging by using a dedicated server, but I get the same error only than with HLDS.exe.

Is this maybe a programming error by the creators of Action Half-life or am I missing something??

looks like somebody is using for example fprintf with an invalid pointer to the data to be written ... so if it's only with flamerbot, it's probably the bot code, what else ?!

Well I tried commenting out all my fprintf() functions, but that didn't help either. I still get the same error. So I don't think it is the source of my bot.
