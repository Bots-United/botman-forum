Ok, read my old thread "dll chains, headaches" or dont, but i have worked around most of the problems by doing this:

HLDS->Enhanced Bot Mixer->metamod->bot->mp.dll
                                          
                                          -> adminmod

Now i can do all the evil modification i want, but i can't do it with adminmod. When i try to i get:

[ADMIN] ERROR: NULLL Ent for adminmod_timer

and it exits.

I have looked up the piece of source responcable, and here it is:

  
  int istr = MAKE_STRING("adminmod_timer");
  
  pTimerEnt = CREATE_NAMED_ENTITY(istr);
  if ( FNullEnt( pTimerEnt ) ) {
    UTIL_LogPrintf("[ADMIN] ERROR: NULL Ent for adminmod_timer\n" );
    exit(1);
  }

It is called when the first player connects on ClientStart, to initialize adminmod. The problem is somehow adminmod is able to access/thinks its not able to access pTimerEnt or soemthign.

Without modifying adminmods source, how would you suggest i make it so adminmod can have its happy fun with itself without exiting hlds?

OK update: i have narrowed the problem down to the inability of adminmod to CREATE_NAMED_ENTITY            (*g_engfuncs.pfnCreateNamedEntity)
any suggestions?
