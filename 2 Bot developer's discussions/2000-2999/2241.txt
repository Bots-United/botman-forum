I always get this strange error on some maps, cs_italy for example whereas i don't get it on de_dust ( most of the time testing de_dust, therefore i recovered this problem very late and now i don't know which of the changes led to this problem :( ), de_aztec or cs_assault. Does anybody know what this message means in detail ?

It means you are trying to send a network message to an entity that is not a client (player).

This error happens frequently when people are trying SDK tutorials to send messages to players to let them know where they hit another player ("you got a headshot", etc.).  The newbie coder tries to send this network message to the player that was damaged and to the entity that did the damage.  Unfortunetly there are things other than players that do damage (like grenades).  If you try to send a network message to a grenade entity you will get this error from the Half-Life engine.

The easiest way to fix this problem is to check that the entity is a client by using "if (pEdict->v.flags & FL_CLIENT)" before trying to send a network message to that entity.

the stupid thing is that this happens without a bot added and only on some maps. the error message is displayed right after the server has started and u would be able to join ...
