I got a question about the UTIL_TraceLine parameters. What is the "edict_t *pentIgnore"
parameter?

Is that a player that should be ignored in the 
trace line ?

I would like to thank you in the advange,

Alexander

If you don't provide a pentIgnore entity (it's NULL) and start the trace from the origin of an entity (like say the inside of a player), the engine will terminate the trace at the edge of the player (on it's bounding box).  If you pass in the edict of the player, the engine will ignore this entity and continue the trace until it hits another player, another blocking entity in the world or a world brush.

Try it sometime by tracing a line from your player's origin out 1000 units and use NULL as the pentIgnore field.  You'll find that your traces only go a tiny fraction of the total distance.
