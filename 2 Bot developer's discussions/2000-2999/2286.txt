I get this errormessage in the console of halflife:

SZ_GetSpace: overflow on netchan->message
WARNING: reliable overflow for messias
messias overflowed

This happens when I send waypoint information to the console (e.g. it executes ClientPrint maybe 50 times to write out all the information).

It works as it should if I send it to a textfile instead.

Does anyone know what excatly that errormessage means?

That message means you are sending network traffic faster than the client can handle it.  Add a slight delay between the network messages to allow the client to keep up.  You might also be able to tweak some of the Half-Life engine network parameters to get better preformance (check some of the Half-Life tweaking sites for details, i.e. use www.google.com to search for "half-life tweak").

I got this message once when spawning to many temp entities (like waypoint beams).

Try and check for stuff like that (ex. drawing all waypoints in radius bigger than 1000 or all of them without radius check would cause this error.

Strange.

Its happens only when it executes a certain line of code:

sprintf (tmp_buf, "%d", tmp2->In_Edges [cnt2]->WaypointID);
strcat (tmp_buffer, tmp_buf);

When I have bunch of waypoints which also makes it send a lot of messages, it doesn't crash.

Guess I'll have to slow it down somehow.

with things like pointers when u try to grab strings u need to use the STRING() function. Dunno if there is a similarity with this. Beacuse HL can crash as well if you dont put the STRING() bit in ;)
