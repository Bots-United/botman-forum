You should ask the MOD atuhor as he would only know the button values.

You have to do this by a FakeClientCommand like this:

code:

FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "+prone", NULL, NULL);



I thought it was +prone. Look in the config.cfg in your day of defeat folder to check how your key to prone is bind.
