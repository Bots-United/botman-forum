How can I dump all the data of an entity to a file? Is there a specific way of doing this?

you mean dump all the enetities used by the mod??

try using ..

Otherwise if your looking for specific entity data, append it all to a file within your bot code wherever you want to put it. Used entity data is stored in entvars_t i think...

If you just want to dump the edict (entvars_t) fields, you can do this on a field by field basis using the engine\progdefs.h structure as a guide.

If you want to dump the MODs class member variables you will have to access pvPrivateData portion of the edict structure (i.e. pEdict->v.pvPrivateData).  This is a pointer to an area in memory where the C++ object will store it's member data.  There isn't anything that I'm aware of that will indicate the size of this block of memory.  You'll just have to dump some arbitrary ammount (say 64 bytes, or 100 bytes, or 256 bytes).  Warning, going BEYOND the end of the allocated memory for this C++ object can cause an Access Violation which will cause the game to crash (so don't dump too much data).

If you want some source code that does a pretty nice MS-DOS debugger style memory dump (displays hex values and ASCII equivalent), see my NetProbe source code which has a routing in NetProbe.cpp called FormatBuffer that does this....

v.Privatedata sounds good, what format is this in? Float?.

It is a pointer to void (i.e. it doesn't point to anything specific except to some address in memory).

Just do a memory dump starting at that address for some number of bytes.

aah ok, I thoght that might be the case, basically im trying to find where a Sentry Gun stores its owner, I am convinced its in the pvPrivateData which is an awkward SOB.

BTW Botman the HPB template makes a great tool for working out net messages :) I have never used it for bots, more of a debug MOD for outputting data on various things.

I am pretty sure a sentry gun will hold its owner in

code:

pent->v.owner



where pent is the sentry gun entity

and v.owner is the pEdict of its owner!
