hi, look in bot find enemy function in bot_combat.cpp, at the part where it says pNewEnemy = NULL you could add a bit of code that searches for entities with the classname of monster_.... of course you'd have to leave out gman, sitting scientist, furniture etc as you can't kill them.

I made a function myself for this and you woul use it like...

code:

pNewEnemy = BotFindMonsters(pBot);



heres a much simpler version of my function below.
This isn't tested, I just created it there! Remember that monster's origin isn't exactly beteen head and feet, you'll need to either use VecBModelOrigin function or ((pent->v.absmax + pent->v.absmin)/2) to get the proper origin.

So if the bots start targetting the monsters feet, you'll need to tell the bot to target the monsters proper origin. thanks to spyro helping me with this ages ago ;) Although I found out new ways to get good monster locations :p

code:

edict_t *BotFindMonsters(bot_t *pBot)
{
  edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;
  edict_t *pent = NULL;
  edict_t *pMonster = NULL;

  char *pClassname = NULL;

  float search_radius = 2000; // Search 2000 units away from the bot.
  float min_distance = (search_radius + 1);
  float distance;

  Vector monster_origin;

  while ((pent = UTIL_FindEntityInSphere( pent, origin, search_radius )) != NULL)
  {
    pClassname = (char *)STRING(pent->v.classname);   
    if( strncmp("monster_",pClassname,8) == 0 )
    {
      if( strcmp("monster_gman",pClassname) == 0 )
        continue; // Continue looking for different monsters, can't kill gmen
      else if( strcmp("monster_sitting_scientist",pClassname) == 0 )
        continue;
      else if( strcmp("monster_furniture",pClassname) == 0 )
        continue;
    }
    else
      continue; // Only want to look for monsters

    monster_origin = VecBModelOrigin(pent);

    if( IsAlive(pent) && BotEntityIsVisible(pBot,monster_origin))
    {


      distance = (monster_origin - pEdict->v.origin + pEdict->v.view_ofs).Length();

      if( distance < min_distance )
      {
        pMonster = pent;
        min_distance = distance; // Look for the closest monster to shoot
      }
    }
  }

  return pMonster;
}



Soz I keep modifying it, aint my lucky day! :p

you mean dont shoot any other players or just make the bot shoot other bots and not yourself?

Botman included these options with the bot:

put these in the console...

observer 1 (will make you "invisible" to bots)
observer 0 (will put it back to normal)

I take it your trying to make a co-operative type bot? In that case, if you don't want them to shoot ANY players at all then look in bot_combat.cpp again in BotFindEnemy near the bottom where it looks for players and comment it out.
