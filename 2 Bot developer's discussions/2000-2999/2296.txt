I am trying to increase the bots aiming and I have noticed that the bot could be unloading a whole clip on you and hits you some of the time but as soon as it reloads and fires one shot, it's a headshot and kills you. There must be some hidden function within the HL engine that recalibrates either the bots position or the enemies position.

Has anyone else noticed this? It's almost as if through each frame, the angles for the bot and the enemy is not being passed back.

Are you talking about CS? Then the "problem" that bots don't headshot you 100% is probably the weapon recoil: when you fire a bullet your aiming cursor moves up, a mod function affecting bots as well as players. After reloading you don't have this effect, so the first bullet hits...

Are you trying to change the bots aiming? There is a fuinction in bot_combat.cpp called something like BotBodyTarget() (If you didnt know that already)

Hmmm, Recoil? So then there must be a function that resets the croshairs. I searched the SDK and didn't see anything about that.

Any more ideas?

Because the recoil is a part of the CS mod code and we don't get the source for that.

Just remembered this thread that we had about vision and aiming some time ago - maybe it'll help you to gather some ideas...

for cs, you simply need:

burst fire (good burst fire will increase performance)

'lower aiming'. THis means, the longer the bot holds fire, the more you have to lower the aiming a bit to compensate the recoil... which most humans do btw.
