Hi everyone,

im makin a bot for sven coop but when i add a bot in the game my server crashes with an "sz_getspace: tried to write to an uninitialized sizebuf_t" error. Ive searched this forum and found some people getting the same problem with some other mods.Has anyone found a fix for this?

Thnx in advance

these errors are caused by the engine sending normal client messages to bots (fakeclients) the bots edict flag must be FL_FAKECLIENT if it isn't already. Otherwise you might be sending some network packet the bots don't like!

I think it may just be the svencoop mod, since a lot more ppl have tried making a bot using botmans template for it and have the same prob as you..!

I mostly get such errors when i try to send to much data at once. Sometimes it gives me the error as above, sometimes i get dropped to desktop and sometimes i get a reliable overflow error.

In Svencoop, you can get a bot to join the game, but you can't make it spawn.
