Hi,

I'm at the moment really confused about botman's
source code and I hope if someone could help me
understand what I'm doing ;)

So please correct my assumptions if needed ..

* edict_t structure contains all variables needed by a client.

* bot_t structure contains all variables needed by the bots.

* To find a edict_t belonging to a bot I just look
in the bot_t.pEdict, which is a pointer to the client.

* To find a bot_t belong to a client I have to compare the client to all the pEdict pointers in my bot list. If I cannot find a pEdict, which is the same as one from my bot list the client is a human player.

If these four assumptions are correct then the problem I have is in my code -- if one of these four assumptions is wrong, then I better can start looking for another hobby ... 

I would like to thank you in the advange

Alexander Verburgt

Your assumptions are correct.  The edict_t structure is used by the Half-Life engine for all entities (including clients).  The bot_t structure contains only the variables needed by a bot (to keep track of what it's doing, etc.).

When the bot is created, the bot_t.pEdict pointer is set to point to the edict_t structure for that bot.  Once you know the bot_t pointer, you can quickly find the edict_t pointer (just by using pEdict).

To find the bot_t pointer that matches a edict_t pointer, you must scan through the array of bot_t structures, looking for the bot_t.pEdict pointer that matches the edict_t pointer that you started with.  Each bot_t structure will have a unique pEdict pointer (no 2 bots will shared the same edict_t pointer value).

Thank you very much for the fast and complete answer !

I'll continue my programming right away =)
