I was adding support for Ricochet in my bot using the 'standard' procedure and almost everything is fine.

The bots spawn ok, jump around happily and shoot eachother.

The only problem I have is that the player`s view model went from a player`s hand holding a disc to gordon`s hand holding a grenade...

There is no grenade whatsoever in the exported entities list and the only weapon_ entity is a weapon_disc. Ricochet is the only mod with this problem - all other 23 mods work fine...

Anyone have a clue?

Possibly the Ricochet models are buggy!

My guess is that there is something in the bot template that cause this wierd thing to happen. Since it`s the first time I see this I realy have no clue...

Does the bot template has something to do with hand models?

Luckily it`s only an aesthetic bug - you see a hand grenade model instead of a disc model.
