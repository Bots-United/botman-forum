Is it possbile to get two instance of half-life on one machine??? As I'd like to make a server with one and connect with another to make two players, since I don't have access to a LAN... :(

Either that or can you answer this...

Do bots call the ClientPutInServer function when they join? Because it doesn't seem to be happening...!

Well as far as having 2 instalations of half-life working like that, I havnt got it to work.  I get a error about opening the engine dll.  I know its possible to run the dedicated server and join a lan game from the same instalation.... you just recive a helleva lot of lag.

didn't work here too, and a dedicated server won't add another player.

If you need someone to connect over the internet, mail me: tubpc@authmann.de

true. I managed to run a dedicated server, then ran a hltv server to connect to it, add bots on my dedicated server and watch them through hltv. Also, i could join that server too.

All with the same install, you need a good cpu though to make it smooth. It ran with a 'ping' of 200~300.

uhm

running a dedicated server and playing on it isnt a hassle, at least not with win2k

just make sure you put the server on another port than the default one.

And you'll get no lag either, its got to do with win2k multitasking i believe, there is a small prog floating around some where which lets you do the same on win9x

you see ... I'm 'trying' to make a program which will log player actions, times and may also act as an anti-cheat device :) 

And what I am doing is I am using the HPB_Bot template to remove all bot code but instead use players instead of bots in BotThink. In dll.cpp where each bot is in an array ( in bots[] ) I've made my own ( called players[]) to hold values for each player, like the last time they shot someone, the last player they shot, the last player they killed and the last buttons they pressed etc etc...!

Each player is stored in an empty place in the players[] array once a client connects (put in the server) and deleted when they disconnect. I done it similar to the clients[] array in dll.cpp

Each player[] array has its own pPlayer edict in it (to tell the actual pEdict values of that player)similar to the a bots pEdict.

Now I just need to test somethings to see if my code in (what is still bot_client) that looks for damage/death messages, so I can determine the person that a player shot and who that player was.

The only problem is that because I use ClientPutInServer to add things into my player[] array, bots do not seem to use that function when they connect so I guess it's a client only thing. I can't test it myself since I can't add more than one player to the server (myself only) and I simply can't test it :(

Any help here would be appreciated!!!;D

difficult one :(

you could try to find information about the hl protocol and write a small fake client that sends network traffic to simulate a login and then exits.. but I doubt that that'll be easy :)

you could however - whenever a bot is added - try to call ClientPutInServer manually. You'll see if that crashes on fake clients...


Now I'm wondering: Do you have anything in mind how to detect cheaters with that information or are you just playing around a little?

WEll I am going to play around and see what I get.

Checking to see if a player shoots someone through a wall is easy (I think). I'd just copy the BotEntityIsVisible function to make it work with the player and the target player, so if a player damages some1 he can't see then I can detect this, although the problem is that the player may know ehere the enemy actually is... So I might just log things for the time being, such as players aiming accuracy, how many times they shoot people through walls and also if they shoot people whilst flashbanged (Using the current fade message, although this may not be called by cheaters since it won't fade if they have some sort of anti-flashbang cheat!) Although I could still do that part manually by looking for flashbang grenades, if they are visible, and when they go off (when they no longer exist).

I can determine players accuracy simply by counting how many times they shoot and how many times their shots land. 

Also I could measure the players angles to check whether they are inhumane, i.e. go from one angle to a completly different angle in one frame. 

Thats just pure speculation though (e.g. I dont know if aimbots change to exact angles towards an enemy after one frame), thats why I really need to test something like it..!

Sounds good, but it's better to let someone cheat than to kick a legit player. It's not the cheating that destroys cs, it's that good players are accused of cheating all the time.


I once killed a player through a wall with pure luck. Saw him disappear behind a corner, aimed at the wall - BANG - headshot with AWP. I don't want to be kicked for that. I also shoot at walls when I see just the enemys weapon because he's too stupid to camp or whatever.


accuracy doesn't really count. With a desert eagle on close distance, it's easy to make all shots hit, with a para for a distant enemy: no chance.

Inhuman turns.. I don't know, but when a player lags the next frame a packet reaches the server it might not only move incredibly fast, but also turn around 180° in one frame.


So.. be careful in your definition of "cheat" !

Yeah... Thats why I'd think I might just log everything to a file maybe. But if I want to kick players then I'd probably need to check to see if the players that I think are cheating are continously doing so!

I could develop some sort of program to log all info I think that might be cheating to tell the server operator to look out for these "dodgy" players. Hehe, I'll at least let a human decide if what I try simply kicks everyone!
