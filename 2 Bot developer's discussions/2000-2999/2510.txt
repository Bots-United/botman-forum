Ok peeps, we've got a problem of unequalled magnitude, and its pretty clear that Valve cannot fix it in any hurry without yet another partial engine rewrite to allow Quake III style "Virtual Machines"

Server side, I've been tinkering with a small idea. I call it 5strike :)

The idea is to create an invisible "oribiter" player around the real player, which will ghost its last 100 frames of movement, and have the opposite skin to the player (i.e. red becomes blue, CT becomes T)

When the player "locks on" to this phantom model, they get a strike. By limiting the strikes/min aimbots can be filtered. A higher strike ratio setting means that it's less likely to kick someone. A lower one is likely to kick innocent players etc etc.

I should imagine extensive balancing would be needed to find a "sweetspot" setting that keeps cheaters in check, without being too unfair on non-cheaters.

Anyone got any ideas or feedback?

Personally, the VM architecture is the way forward. Quake III Arena cheats are among the most difficult to create because of this.

Not really feedback here but a crappy idea :) 

I was thinking of maybe a way to monitor the players yaw/pitch speed (because I would think an aimbot will automatically lock on to a player instantly) and if the pitch/yaw hits exactly what the server calculated. (E.g. in hpb_bot you will use VecToAngles to get the angles to face something exactly) So you could use something like it to check what the exact angles are to face a player and maybe add a little offset to it. 

Of course I know that some aimbots don't exactly aim for the head or body origin so It's not a great way of checking unless you knew what the aimbot setting was. 

Also I would think something like this would need a "strike technique" as you said (like when the server finds a player facing quite a very close angle to the player in a small time then you get a strike) And then three strikes and you're out!!

If this worked then all aimbots will be effectively useless :)

Phew that was a biggy to read :)

An idea in the other tread i think would work well, till an aimbot author figured out how it works what it does, similar to what Dark Youth said, creating an invisible player, but make it directly below them, and if they aim directly below them selfs for to long, make it create a poll or something to kick the user...

but don't make it put the entity there instantly because then they will know what is happening track it down easliy and prevent it..make it put it there at a random intervils
