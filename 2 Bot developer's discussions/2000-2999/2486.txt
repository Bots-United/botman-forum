Ok guys, the cheating in HL/CS is really starting to piss me off, especially the OGC Hack. Has anyone tried to have the Bot program look for these cheats, such as wall and autoaim hacks? I am on a mission hear. Any help and thoughts would be appreciated by me and the game players of the world.

This is an excellent idea, though not really bot-related.

does anyone here know exacly how the OGC stuff works?  is it a hacked client? maybe we could load up a server with engine_debug on, and see what the hell these ogc guys are doing?  I completely agree with this sentiment, especially because of the political shenanagan's between punkbuster and valve, half-life needs anti-cheat stuff badly...

I hope its ok to post this question on this forum. The HPB Bots can make a big difference if we can pull this off.

By the way, you can download the source code to the OGC hack here: http://www.mpcheats.com/

OGC currently at the moment does randomly generated files, to stop things like this happening server side, so detecting it via the server is basisly impossible, how ever suspecting it is not, monitoring angle changes, seeing who is aiming at who through a wall, could create a vote, for the user to vote if that guy is cheating, then kick him..

ogc is done by, injecting a dll into the half-life process(hl.exe) then hooking the getprocaddress function, and calls to functions in the client.dll get intersepted, and ogc does what it wants with them..

ogc is not one of them most powerfullest, but one of the most used, because its released, an alternative angle at stoping cheaters, would be confronting the cheat makers them selfs(in this case system) and try and convince him to keep it more private, not so public, that doesn't mean go and just tell him, yell at him, etc but be nice, point out some good angles for everyone, including that cheat detection programs can stop his cheat easiest because he releases it, that sort of stuff, i've thought about talking with him about keeping his a little more private, just haven't got around to it, maybe next time i chat with him i'll try to convince him..

I think what Gunny means is using a server side Add-On to generate statistical analysis of the players kill/death ratio as well as how well they are able to maintain aim on other players.

Just trying to catch aimbots shouldn't be too difficult, if you knew the behaviour of the aimbot code.  You can store the aiming angles of each player during every frame and compare those to the behaviour of the aimbot.  Sufficiently skilled aimbots will randomize the aiming angles, but if a player is constantly staying on aim for long periods of time (especially during erratic enemy movement), chances are that player is not human.

If you don't mind kicking off players that REALLY are that good and aren't using an aimbot, something like this shouldn't be too hard put together, but you will probably get quite a few false hits and wind up banning those people.  If you don't mind doing this, then I would think it would work pretty well.

Aimbot authors would have to start modifying the aimbot code to wildly vary the aiming angles (which will make their aimbot suck compared to other people's aimbots) and less people will tend to use it.

What you utimately want to do is create cheat detection on the one system the cheater doesn't have access to (the server).  Any cheat detection method that you come up with that runs on the client will never work.  This code can always be hacked/bypassed/rerouted/intercepted/whatever and there's nothing that any developer can do to stop that.  Putting cheat detection code on the server is 1000 times more secure than putting it on the client.

I know tons about those cheats heh... I've made my own.. for testing purposes though... I will never release this.. I know mine can't be caught I've managed to use it in a certain way as someone would play normally.  Also I'm working on a Cheat Detection as-well.. I want cheaters to stop using OGC and so forth make it harder for them to find servers that they can use.  For anyone else trying to find away around this I wish you good luck.. I shall have a Cheat Detection algo out soon,  I won't display the code or talk about it either.. You will have to play on my server.  I will post here a message when I have it ready and working....

I am glad someone is working on this. Question for you all. From within Botmans bots, how do you determine what cvars a client has?

Follow-Up:
Supposedly www.adminmod.org has an admin mod that will block OGC cheats and the like. That is a good sign, so I am sure that Botmans bots can become bad as soldiers as well as game enforcers if this code can be ported into the Bot code.

The best thing would of course be to have it server side, but some server/client stuff might work too...

what if we make a client.dll (like aimbots and hacked clients)that scrambles some of the information that the cheats need to work(cheating-death.com does something like that) and we also send LOTS of signals to the server right after the client has connected, every of those packet would include a "password", one of them which would get accepted by the server so it would see that the client has loaded our client.dll and then it doesnt kick us from the game. The rest of the packages could contain fake "passwords/info" to make it harder to crack it and make a similiar client,only with cheats

Of course the server part would have to do some anticheat stuff too.

But the cool thing is that we could implement some nice features that the community might find useful(that server vars could turn off), features like : mp3 control, changing hud color, and lots of stuff just like that...

It might be possible :)

Anything that is running on the client can be bypassed/hacked/etc.  No matter what "security" you think you are embedding into the client piece of software, it will be hacked.

The only system that is free from access by the cheaters is the server.  If you can't prevent cheats by ONLY modifying the server then you will be wasting your time.

Botman is correct. Don't even waste your time looking for a way to block cheating by looking at the client, the server side is the only way. I have reviewed data presented by the bot debug_engine option and seen nothing out of the normal when OGC clients connect. I also looked at the sdk_22 and did not see a way to detect, YET. Getting an understanding of that code is going to take me a bit.
Some of the functions that I see OGC using can be trapped on the server side but the function is not passing the edict of the client as a parameter, so I can use it to kick the client. Using C++ there must be a way to get the edict of a client that is making the function call. Hmmm

well, i dont think you'll find any info with debug_engine or any other way from the server, because the cheats are clientside, from the servers POV they seem like normal clients...

and botman, I know that serverside is the only way to go,I just posted an idea of mine =)

A way it could be done, create an player, that is two small for anything to do, then make this player directly below every player, if a player is aiming at it for more then like 5 seconds stright, then they are likly a cheater, because it will identify it as a player, and try to use its aimbot on it...

Then the aimbot author would just ignore players that are closer than X units.

Like I said, any attempt to prevent cheating on the client side won't work.  Any attempt to prevent cheating on the server side will wind up banning really good players.

"i wonder how valve is trying to solve this issue"

My guess is that they are trying to prevent people from loading DLLs other than the client.dll (and sw.dll or hw.dll depending on whether you have software or hardware video drivers).  This would stop some of the more "simple" hacks.  Anyone advanced enough to intercept the client.dll can also patch the hl.exe executable to remove these checks.  Even if Valve tries to validate the executables on the client by doing a CRC or MD5 check and comparing that to the same files on the server, this could be intercepted (and modified) by a network proxy running on the client.

It will be interesting to see what method Valve uses to attempt to prevent cheaters and it will interesting to see how long it takes people to get around this method.

I read somewhere that they are making a "pure" option, like in q3..I read that they were going to put every file in paks and have the pure server option...

So the reason i said "i wonder how valve is trying to solve this issue" is just because I wanted to get some sort of confirmation :P

I don't have Quake3, but from the information that I can gather on the Internet, a "pure" Quake3 server is one that restricts clients to using the maps, models, textures, and sounds to those that are in the distribution pak files (i.e. the player cannot change models or sounds, etc.).

This doesn't really have anything to do with cheats, since aimbots and other types of clientside cheats aren't changing the models or sounds or textures (well, the GOOD ones aren't anyway).  Many of the early aimbots used modified models (spiked models, red/green models, etc.), but the "modern" aimbots hook directly into the client.dll code and "help" the player aim by tracking positions of edicts sent to the client by the server.  Since these modern aimbots don't need model replacements, use a "pure" server configuration wouldn't slow them down one little bit.

To the best of my knowledge Valve has not released ANY information describinging in ANY kind of detail how they will attempt to prevent client side cheats.  Anyone who reports the methods that Valve plans to use is simply taking a wild guess.

Again, the aimbot cheater isn't modifying the client.dll so putting it in the pack file wouldn't change anything.  The client.dll is not being modified.  The problem is that hl.exe is allowing other DLLs to get loaded into the same process space.

And of course, you can't put the hl.exe file in the .pak because Windows wouldn't know how to find it.

Yes but, making something that creates a player entity, then distributing it out to servers not releasing it to the whole public, will mean that not many cheat authors get it.. :) even if some of them do get a copy, you won't have strings there for them to track it down easliy, and find out whats happening

Why not try calculating the average yaw speed of the client when no enemy is visible from him. When his yaw speed suddenly rises when he sees an enemy, he is most probably using an aimbot...

Why not use the which hunt theory. When some one says that some one else is cheeting a vote should be taken between the people on the server if a majority of the people think he/she is a cheeter then use ban or kick on them. Personaly I think things like punk buster and other anti cheets are retarded being that they cant stop cheeting or even detect it more then half the time. Not only that but it lags your connection bad.

Maybe I am out of my area of expertise, but why don't you just drop the whole cheat detection thing?        The harder you try, the better 'hackers' make their software.  If you drop it, they have no reason to pursue better methods, because the way they do it works and no one can 'find' it.   Let cheaters be cheaters.  If no one would have detected that old aimbots used new models and stuff, it'd probably still be done that way (because no one needs to make it better)  The harder we push, the harder they make it to find, and there become more complex methods to cheat and hide it.  Besides, this is Windows, and its just a game.  I host LAN parties, so it is very obvious to tell who is cheating (you can move to see their screen)  Lots of people don't mind, because it is a challenge to win.  We've even had contests to see who has the best aimbot.  If you are offended by cheaters then get over it.  Cheat better than they do (instead of stopping them), and see who is the best.  Beat them at their own game.

I think this comment is on the right track.... Cheaters often don't care if the entire world knows they're hacking, they're getting their jollies frustrating others. Kicking cheaters seems like no deterent at all. It just makes them move on to another server. I say it's time someone created an invincible server side 'Guardian Bot' to dish out some frustration in return. You could have it follow them around killing them every time they spawn.... lol. Anyways... it's an interesting thought.

Or what about this... invisible ethereal bot players that do nothing but distract aimbots. They could be used like an admin tool to specificly surround suspect players to check for aim bot reactions. Honest players wouldn't even know they've been tested.

Although I agree with botman that those who implement anti cheating programs might risk kicking good players that don't, in fact, cheat.... I also think that currently many admins kick good players based on suspicion alone. As a decent player myself, I think I'd rather take my chances with an imperfect anti-cheating program than a paranoid admin any day. Just my thoughts.

1) People put a lot of time and $$$ into setting up servers and they don't want cheats giving their server a bad name.

2) Cheaters disrespect the value of other peoples time. It's fine to cheat in a solitary game but when you cheat when playing with others you make assumptions about why other people are even there... then you don't appreciate the 'multi-player experience', you take it for granted.

3) Discussions like this about anti-cheating and entire process of cheating vs anti-cheating is stimulating to people who enjoy a challenge. It's the reason both hacks and hack detection even exist. No one realisticly expects to create a fool proof anything... but getting one step ahead is do-able.
