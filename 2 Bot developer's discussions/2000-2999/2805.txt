Does any one know if it exist any tutorial on how to make the bots buy stuff and a tutorial on how to use the VGUI for a bot?

in this forums you'll find really a lot of hints for a buy system - more than enough. ... direct vgui usage is somewhat different ... dunno

I think he means get the bots to use VGUI menus which is exactly the same as buying weapons etc! ;D ? Am I wrong?

well i thought he wants to make a bot menu via the vgui ... but ok, when he just wants to use it, it's the same, yes
