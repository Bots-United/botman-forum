I was wondering how does the bot hears guns and bullets sound?

Since the bots doesnt really hear since we need the speed of the bots to fake the hearing, do we need to the same too?

you could do:

check for any bots/players. Check their weapon (what they are holding). That is, the weapon with the same origin as the player itself (if i'm not mistaken).

Then you can check if that specific bot is holding fire. 

In fact, to hear the shooting, you simply check if a player pushes IN_ATTACK. Then you check how far the bot/player is, and you can do some hearing with that. If you want to know if the bot hears the shoot against a wall. Like the bot is to far away, but you still need to hear the sounds when a bullet hits the wall. You could trace a line from any player straight forward. Then check the entity it is blocked. And then check if that same bot presses ATTACK. Thus:

- If a  bot presses ATTACK
- And that bot has a traceline to a wall
- And that vector (blocked traceline) is near the bot who is at the moment 'listening'..

THEN it could hear the bullet. Do some randomness as the hL engine does not always play a sound, but i think its 99% accurate doing it this way.

Then you can simply do the same code as you always did with hearing.
