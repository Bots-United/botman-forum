I would like to devolop a bot for making an AVI file out of a halflife demo file. 

The regular way of doing this is to use the "startmovie" console command and then play your demo, however, this method requires a large amount of diskspace because the data (screenshots) are uncompressed.

So I figured it might would be possible to make a bot to do the compressing, but I could use some help to make this possible.

Would the bot have to be clientsided or serversided to make it run while playing a demo?

How do I the output on the screen so I can compress it?

Other problems that might occur?

I don't think you can do this.  All of the video rendering is handled internal in the engine.  Neither the client nor the server has direct access to the video display (which you would need to perform a screen capture).

You might be able to create an external Windows interface that did a direct capture (BitBlt) of video memory and save that to a file.  You could create a server side plug-in that would notify the Windows app when a new frame had occurred (StartFrame) and have the Windows app save the frame at that point.  I suspect that the latency between the Windows app and the Half-Life engine would decrease your frame rate somewhat, but you probably don't want anything more than 20-30 FPS anyway, otherwise the download file would be to large.

Software exist that hijack your soundcard's buffer in real-time and translate it into the audio format you want in a file. The same thing must exist for video or I would be very surprised.

sure it exists, but your video card stores a lot more information than your sound card. Expect a huge frame rate drop when trying it.

So far I managed to make a console command in a bot, which captures the screen.

Unfortantly, it doesn't work while playing demos.
