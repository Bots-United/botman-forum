Something i have found lacking on all the dll coding sites is how to spawn fully functional entities in a game (server side dll). If you could tell me all the things nessescicary to do this and in what order, especially for func_breakable, it would be a great help. Right now i have setting model, entity class, location, vectors, type, setsize(), setorigin(), dispatchspawn(), and then setclientkeyinfo's for several things (gibmodel, boyancy, etc). It dosne't work, its liek it ignores the setclientkey's (i.e. i can't set the material type, or the gibmodel.. or even make it gib, jsut break)

If there is anything you are looking for in here... http://planethalflife.com/hlprogramming/ it has tutorials of making new weapons etc, I take it that it may also have what you are looking for in them.

Have u got the HL SDK? I'm sure there is plenty of code on it, and there is a FAQ and documentation with it all!

I think the client key value stuff has to come before the DispatchSpawn() function is called.

Do you need to create a completely new breakable from scratch or do you just need to "re-create" old, broken entities. If you just need to respawn entities let me know and I'll help you.

You cant do that.

You can spawn stuff like a xen_tree etc. (Point entities)

You can spawn brush based entities as long as the BSP model for the ent is already in the map.

I never said you couldn't do what BillDoor said.
