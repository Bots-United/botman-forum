I finally saw my bot deploy a tripmine w00t...! This is a simple way code to get bots to lay tripmines I got to work (with botmans HPBBOT Template 3), I only saw one bot deploy it so far! :)


this is in bot.cpp at the wall avoid code.

code:

                              if ((pBot->f_dont_avoid_wall_time <= gpGlobals->time) &&
                                    BotCantMoveForward( pBot, &tr ))
                              {
                                    // ADD LATER
                                    // need to check if bot can jump up or duck under here...
                                    // ADD LATER

                                    BotDeployTripmine ( pBot );


                                    if( pBot->current_weapon.iId != VALVE_WEAPON_TRIPMINE )
                                          BotTurnAtWall( pBot, &tr );
                              }



code:

void BotDeployTripmine ( bot_t *pBot )
{
      
      edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;
      
      
      if ((pBot->bot_weapons & (1<<VALVE_WEAPON_TRIPMINE)))
      {
            if (pBot->current_weapon.iId != VALVE_WEAPON_TRIPMINE)
                  UTIL_SelectItem(pEdict, "weapon_tripmine");

                  pEdict->v.button |= IN_ATTACK;                               // Deploy tripmine
      }
      else
            return;
      
    return;
}

nice. The 'else' part is not nescesary :)
Anyhow, this is not 100% solid... what if a bot got stuck by another bot? (in hl DM its unlikely i know), or, it got stuck by something it cannot place a tripmine on?

Suggestion:
- Trace a line forward, 48 units, if blocked, you can place tripmine (check if it is not a player, or any other entity you cannot place it uppon)


Also, a timer could help you out. Like, when you want the bot to unstuck itself with jumping and ducking, you should have some function which will:

OR : place tripmine
OR : unstuck

if place tripmine is choosen, set a timer, so this question is not asked anymore and the tripmine check and placement begins (if invalid check, you unstuck anywayz)

if unstuck is choosen, do botmans unstuck code

phew, lots of typing. Hope this will help ya out a bit.

Yeah I think I had something in my "else" part but I removed it! :) The fact is I onlt saw a bot lay 1 tripmine in so many games (and it just shot it and blew it up again :( !!!) I forgot about the bots hitting of players or whatever, I think a better way to check is to see if tr.pHit is NULL (i think) cos then i think it means that it didn't hit an entity, so it will be able to deploy the tripmine properly.....

I guess there may be more places (or states such as 'stuck') where I could allow the bot to deploy a tripmine... :)
