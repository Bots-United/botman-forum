I just read a most interesting thread, "unwaypointed navigation" where Robert Blum drops the bomb that he has a working BSP parser.  It's funny, it's when I'm not paying attention to the forum that the best discussions take place!

In response to Tobias and Count Floyd about where I am and how my BSP parser is coming along, I haven't gotten anywhere.  I got as far as making structures in code to hold all the data types but then forgot about it.  So, a formal apology to all who hoped I would be giving you a useful tool.  

ExecutionBot isn't dead, though.  Far from it, and by the looks of what I was reading in that thread, Robert is going to give me a run for my money :)

VERY BASIC bsp parser is the key word here. It finds all walkable surfaces, it connects them OK when they share an edge.

Jumps are sort of OK. Ladders are next. If there's any interest, I'll upload sample waypoint files from time to time so people can discuss results. (And help me find problems :-)

We'll see. As usual, real life interferes with my programming projects.... 
So right now, the pace is slow...
