hi there, got some hpb-template related questions here:

- how does one send an UTIL_SayText message to one specific team?
- is it possible to determine a players health and ammount/type of armor?

thanks in advance.

UTIL_HostSay() will allow you to specify a player's edict and a teamonly flag that will send this message only to that player's team.

The edict_t field "health" stores the player's health and the field "armor" stores the armor value (for most MODs).  There's isn't different types of armor stored in the edict_t structure.  If the MOD supports different armor types then they are storing it in a member variable of one of the C++ classes (probably in CBasePlayer) which you don't have access to.
