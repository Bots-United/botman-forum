Hello.

I'm stuck again on a little problem...

How can I get the size of a plane ? e.g. the hit plane that is returned by a trace: tr.pHit

I tried to retrieve tr.pHit->v.size (it's a vec3_t) but it seems to work only for VERY small planes (like the ropes of the bridge in de_aztec), any bigger plane returns me (0, 0, 0) and I don't see what to retrieve else than this one...

I need that for better staircase detection. When my bots fire tracelines in their field of view, if the tr.vecPlaneNormal.z is equal to 0, then bot knows he pointed a vertical plane. Now I'd like him to know the height of this plane, and if it is less than 18 (which is the maximal stair height), fire one or two more tracelines to figure out if it is really a stair...

Any idea? I'm stuck...

try (v.absmax - v.absmin) ?

does not work!
v.absmax - v.absmin is v.size btw...

I don't know of any way to get the vertexes of a plane (which you need to determine the size since all surfaces are not 4 sided polygons) without reading the dplane_t data directly from the BSP file.

See my planethalflife.com/botman/bsp_tool.shtmlBSP tools project if you want to go this route for some sample source code.  Of course, the BSP tools are GNU GPL so you would need to release the source code to your bot if you use any of that stuff (I know you already do, but others would need to be aware of this also).

I'm aware of your methods in BSP analysis, but it scares me a bit because if I start to figure out something from the BSP file, why not make a complete terrain analyzer for bot navigation and tactics based on the BSP files ?

... I know myself, for sure I would rush and code something that way ;-) ... that's why I don't even want to hear about this, because I don't have time to write such big stuff !

Weird point of view, isn't it ?

in short, "keep it simple, or I'll go mad!!"
