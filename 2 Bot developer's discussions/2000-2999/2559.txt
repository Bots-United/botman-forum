i try to adapt your source for DMZ:
to make a kick : +attack2
to make a punch : +attack

to make a fireball : +beam

i manage to make bots use kick & punch (in bot_combat) but i do not manage to make them use +beam :
i try fake client command "+beam"
or "+beam;wait;-beam" or "beam"
but nothing work !!!!!

i try to add in in_button.h : IN_BEAM
and in bot_combat instead of :pEdict->v.button |= IN_ATTACK
i try pEdict->v.button |= IN_BEAM

no error but nothing anymore !!!!

1.is it the right way to 'declare' a knew IN_....
or shall i add some somewhere else ???

2.Why fake clien command do not work ????

3.HOW CAN I DO ??????

4.i still have a prob with the speed:
even if i do :
pBot->f_max_speed = CVAR_GET_FLOAT("sv_maxspeed")/4;
[in bot_cpp]

or 
f_max_speed = 200.0
or a distance/enemy code detection and then slow/accel but it do not work....

i have an other prob :
i add info_player_team1 and a lot of
others link_funct but i cant find the right
linkfunct for spawning !!!!!

can anibody help me ???
can you help me.....

1. No, you can't just create your own buttons (IN_WHATEVER) unless those are actually also used by the MOD (you may have to e-mail the MOD developers to determine if they added new bit masks to the buttons field).

2. FakeClientCommand() will send a command just as though a real client had sent it.  If the same command works for a real client (i.e. if you can enter the exact same command on your console) then it will work for bots.  You can enable the "debug_engine" logging and search for places where "ClientCommand:" occurs to see where commands are sent from the client to the server.

3. HOW CAN I DO WHAT???

4. You can control the speed by changing the move_speed and side_speed arguments used in the pfnRunPlayerMove() function.  Try hardcoding the values you want in the places where pfnRunPlayerMove() occurs in the bot template code.

P.S. it sounds like you are trying to solve TOO many problems at once.  Work on one problem at a time, when you solve that problem, move on to the next one until you have everything working.  Trying to work on too many problems at once just causes more confusion and frustation.
