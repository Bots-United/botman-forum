Sorry to bother you again, Botman...

While viewing some maps with your excellent BSP viewer, I noticed that the character entities (gman) you use to represent the info_player_deathmatch spawn points all face the same direction. What I want to know is: do your gmans face the same direction players do when they spawn on the map ?
&& last question: how would you retrieve the value of the spawn angle ?

Again, thanks for your time...

No, they all face a yaw of 0 degrees.

Look at the player spawn point entity (it's different for different MODs).  One of the key/value pairs will be the angle (or angles) unless the mapper wants the player to spawn with a yaw of 0 degrees (in which case there probably won't be a angle or angles key/value pair for the player spawnpoint).

Hmmm botman ? What have I wrong ?

code:

   // pent is a info_player_deathmatch entity
   char *infobuffer;
   char angle[32], angles[32];

   infobuffer = (*g_engfuncs.pfnGetInfoKeyBuffer) (pent);
   strcpy (angle, (g_engfuncs.pfnInfoKeyValue (infobuffer, "angle")));
   strcpy (angles, (g_engfuncs.pfnInfoKeyValue (infobuffer, "angles")));

   sprintf (msg, "SPAWN ANGLES: %s\n", angles);
   ClientPrint (pEntity, HUD_PRINTCONSOLE, msg);
   sprintf (msg, "SPAWN YAW: %s\n", angle);
   ClientPrint (pEntity, HUD_PRINTCONSOLE, msg);



I tested it with spawn points of de_dust (they DO have spawn angles) but it doesn't display anything, like if the key/value pair didn't exist !!

???

Tried pent->v.angles ?

The "angle" or "angles" key/value pair is not stored as part of the player's infobuffer.

Like cheesemonster said, you can look at pEdict->v.angles.y as soon as the player spawns if you want to know which direction they are facing.

The alternative is to intercept all of the info_player_deathmatch and info_player_start entities when the DispatchKeyValue() functions are being called for them.  Look at the HPB bot source code where I intercept the team limits information for Team Fortress Classic.  TFC stores the max number of players on a team in the "ammo_medikit", "ammo_detpack", "maxammo_medikit", and "maxammo_detpack" key/value pairs for the "info_tfdetect" entity (parsed in the DispatchKeyValue function).

That's it cheesy! info_player_deathmatch entities have a pev->angles under the form (0, y, 0) where y seems to be the yaw the player faces when he spawns on that point. Thank you!

Btw, did it happen to you? My bots all face the same direction when they respawn, they don't seem to be affected by this spawn angle and often they spawn facing a wall! That's why I needed to retrieve this spawn angle to manually assign it to them...
