When I was testing my bot on a dedicated server yesterday, I noticed a really strange thing: one bot was flying (or rather: hovering) right in mid-air, he seemed to be camping (looking around). When I tried to shoot him, there was nothing to hit, the shots went straight through it... This "ghost" stayed there for the entire time I was playing (I joined the DS from the same machine). Before I entered the game, I let a HLTV client connect and disconnect several times, don't know if it could have s.th. to do with it.
Now I've read in some bot forums about funny looking flying bots, which makes me think that it might be not so uncommon a problem. But has anybody ever solved it? Some ideas or hints where I could start looking? I'm absolutely clueless.

lol that is strange... It might have something to do with the MOD you are running the bot with. Or perhaps you've seriously overflown an array or stack some where hehe...

recently I've been trying to get a lot of things working myself and I keep overflowing call stacks somehow or there are really gremlins in the code hehe

That was happening on the crossfire map in normal HLDM - no mod involved...

Not necessarily a bug in your code I think. It happens a lot on public servers that clients leave and their players are still rendered in the game for some time. They will float in the air and do some jerky anims (and can't be hurt too). If they are staying in the game for a whole round however it's serious. Perhaps it's a problem with the additional Entities from HLTV like in your other thread.
