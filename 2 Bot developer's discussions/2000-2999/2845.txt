My Modpage ( http://www.gamemods.de.vu ) even has a bot Section: http://home.arcor.de/survivor_kali/deutsch/themen_pcgames_mods_halflife_bots.htm

and I search for other bots. If something is incorrect or you have a bot which is not listed please say it. 

P.S. When there is a Bot like Akimbot or HPB which supports a large number of mods I don't write the version number.

You might want to add my bot to your list:
RACC (formerly PMBot)
homepage in http://perso.libertysurf.fr/pm0001/
support for Half-Life, Deathmatch Classic (but still weapon select bug), Opposing Force, Azure Sheep (hides correctly HEV-related items in standard HL maps), Team Fortress Classic and Counter-Strike.

I am currently looking for a web space provider to put the source files, because LibertySurf doesn't allows me to upload more than 2~3 Mb at once. Currently I'm tweaking next release's code...

It is not well known, I need feedback on it. Because it is a waypointless bot, some people may or may not like it...

Kali,

Please note that the Rho-Bot is NOT DEAD!!!

Also, the Rho-Bot is used in several other mods, including DMC and OZ Deathmatch.

See http://www.gamershomepage.com/rhobot/ for more details.

Thanks!
Scooter

@Pierre: I added the bot but because of the large number of supported mods I did not write the version. There are a lot of free-hosting providers which can give you free webspace. When I've time I'm going to test your bot.

@Scooter: Bot added :) . 


In my list I added Azur Sheep as a Single Player game, but when I understood you correctly you did an (extra)-support for it?

Also just note that the status of "Rocket Crowbar" should be "Final" or something, (i.e no more releases but not dead)

also... Beta versions of Rocket Crowbar 2 is under development! :D

Ok, If anybody likes to support other mods I added a download-section which is checkable from this bot-page.


More bot downloads will come.

Well in fact Azure Sheep doesn't forbid multiplayer mode explicitly... they just blankened the word in the menu! Because this MOD does not provide MP models nor maps, that's the Half-Life models and maps that get used. But I like playing HL deathmatch with this mod:
-First because the HEV charger and armor items have no effect on players (thus adding vulnerability to player and I like that)
-And finally because they've reskinned the crowbar in a nice straight iron bar!
Furthermore, they have added 3 other weapons that could eventually be used if someone decided to write a map for this MOD's (hidden) multiplayer mode 8)

Perhaps you should just change the Dead/Develop/Whatever column to the date that the bot was last updated and let the reader determine for themselves if a bot is "Dead".

Botman's idea is not bad, but I think there would be some readers which think for example Podbot is down because they read the last date. I will think about it [bad english I know ].

@Botman: HPB is temp. dead ?

Update: Freedom is now under construction in this list.

In fact I had put support for DMC in my code even before Botman released the HPB 1.8 source code, and at this point, my code already had MANY structural differences with even the bare template 3. But I double-checked all the points that needed attention:
-bitwise-way of storing weapons in an integer (bit shift instead of ordinal numbers)
-CmdStart() usage for bots to issue change weapon commands
Seems like the CmdStart() does not work with fakeclients... strange! I found nothing illogical! I say, I'm turning mad with that bug !!! :o

So if anyone wants to help, pleaaase contact me !!!

Wooooo-Hooooo !!!! DMC weapon select bug FIXXXXXXED !!!! Damn it took me at least TWO MONTHS !!!! ;D

Look at this STUPID thing:
code:

void BotFireWeapon (Vector v_enemy, bot_t *pBot)
{
   // some stuff at start of function...
   int weapon_index;
   // do some stuff with weapon_index

   // now it's time to cycle through weapons
   while (i_havent_found_the_right_weapon)
   {
      int weapon_index = 0; // THE FIRST WORD OF THAT LINE IS THE BUG
      int value = pSelect[select_index].iId;
      while (value > 0)
      {
         weapon_index++; // array position from weapon value (bitshifted)
         value = value >> 1;
      }

      // additional checks to select the right weapon
   }

   // now we have selected a weapon, issue the command
   BotSelectWeapon (pBot, weapon_index);

   // rest of function follows
}



STUPID C++ COMPILERS !!! A bare C compiler wouldn't have let me do this !

happy happy joy joy

I did the new list, but botmans idea hasn't been implemented: that should change soon.

Or what do the others think? Is a release date or my opinion *g* the best status for a bot?

I did not add the bot because I did not know of it. That changed now.
