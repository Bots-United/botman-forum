I'm currently making the movement system for my bot.

I'm currently using a radius to check whether a waypoint has been reached, however its not working too well that way.

It seems the bot somehow misses the waypoint and turns 350-360 degrees to go back for the waypoint for a few ms. It only happens sometimes but if the waypoint is just before a jump, its enough to screw up the jump making it take a wrong direction.

So I want to find another way to check whether a waypoint has been reached - something like a check for whether the bot has passed the waypoint (e.g. using a box instead of a circle).

Whats your experiences? What is the best way to do this?

maybe this helps.
Every frame you check the distance between the waypoint you are heading to and the waypoint you should be heading to (they should be reachable though!). 

When both waypoints are reachable and you are closer to the 'next' waypoint then the waypoint you are currently heading to, then you could say that the bot got past the waypoint.

There is also another check , you can find it using the search option of this forum.
