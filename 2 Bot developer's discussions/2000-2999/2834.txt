I've been going through the HPB_bot 1.8a source, and i think i've made a few conclusions about how things work.  I wanted to run them by some others to make sure I was correct.
---

There are two ways the bot deals with the world.  The first is in BotThink(), which gets called every frame.  The second is a "reactive" logic, which gets called whenever messages are sent to the client (being damaged can cause the bot to face the damage source).

I'm curious how often the client messages can be sent, how they're sent in relation to frames being processed.

Ideally, i'd like to capture all the relevant messages for the bot for a current frame, and give them to the bot to deal with in his BotThink()

Another question: in bot_client.cpp, there are:

BotClient_CS_ShowMenu()
and
BotClient_CS_VGUI()

they seem to do the same thing, and i would assume VGUI would be a "new" way of doing things where ShowMenu would be an "old" way, kept for compatability.  Is this correct?

Another question:

Where can I find a list of what the numbers being sent into BotClient_CS_VGUI() represent.  I'd like to add some logic that makes the bots purchase weapons, so knowing what numbers to check for would be, well, essential.

Thanks for any help, and thanks botman for releasing fun code to play with!

The network messages (what you call "reactive") can be sent any time that something happens on the server.  This could be caused by other players (for example the bot taking damage) or it could be caused by non-player entities (for example some entity being respawned and sending a message to all the players telling them this).

Remember that these messages are being sent over the network to all of the players, so the rate of these messages will never exceed the capacity of the network connection (think 56K dialup users).

The BotClient_CS_ShowMenu() stuff was indeed there to handle the old text style Counter-Strike menus (for joining teams).  The BotClient_CS_VGUI() function was added shortly after Valve added VGUI support to MODs.  The default for players is the VGUI menu so the other one shouldn't really be used at all any more (since the bots don't have the ability to switch off the VGUI menu).

The values sent in the network message will be MOD specific (each MOD is different).  These are not documented anywhere except in the source code for the MOD (which you don't have access to).  Most of these have to be figured out by trial and error, but there's several posts on this forum about the CS buy menus detailing what other people have already figured out and documented for you (use the "Search" feature to find them).
