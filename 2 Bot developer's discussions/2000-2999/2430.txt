Hi,

I'm currently working on a bot for HL:CS and I have two questions...

1). Is there somewhere a timer variable I can use, which tells me when a round starts and when the buy time is over. I have looked in the source code but I could find anything yet.

2). Is there an easy way to simulate "as if bots did press a button". I saw in a .h file some keys like "IN_ATTACK" defined. I have found out that I could use "IN_ATTACK" -- however the "IN_FORWARD" did not seem to work. 
I like to avoid setting forward-speed myself, because this speed changes depending on which weapon you are carrying. So, if I can simulate a key-press instead of setting speeds it would save time.

I would like to thank you in advance,

De Spatel Man!

For the round checking stuff, you can look for text messages being sent to the client ("Counter-Terrorists win!", etc.).

You might also want to check some of the released source code for CS bots.  BSDbot is one of them...

(source code is included in the executable download).

You should avoid using the movement IN_ buttons unless totally neccesary. All movements such as ideal_yaw/pitch speed etc are passed into RunPlayerMove()
