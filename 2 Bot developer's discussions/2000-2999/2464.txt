Hi,

I once played HL:CS with the SWAT-bot. I bought a sniper gun and waited for the bots to come. I found out that all the bots walked exactly the same line. So -- I got a clear shot at one I only had to wait for the others to appear for they would get on the same spot where I shot the first.

For this reason I want to avoid using waypoints.
Is my thinking correct or can a waypoint system be adjusted so the bots would walk different lines like real people ?

perhaps if the bots used a more decisive algorithm to find paths then they may take different paths :) Like A* for example.

It is possible to let the bots walk different paths but extra work is needed. Not using waypoints is not advisable, making bots use dynamic paths will be much easier than making bots roam decently without waypoints.

waypoints are a good thing, without them bots can only walk around randomly and will never be able to rush, go to the bomb spot / rocket launcher / whatever on purpose or do other intelligent things.

But navigation should not be tied to waypoints too strict. First of all, you need to make paths dynamic. They should not always choose the shortest path, but different (short) paths.
On a second approach, you could use tracelines to detect if a connection between two waypoints has to be followed precisely or if the bot might strafe left / right while going there, so even walking between two waypoints will never be the same.

Another way is to get rid of the whole "waypoint" concept and use another internal representation for the map. A different representation might be area / room based information for example. They will be quite useful, but VERY painful to code.

Grab yourself an analog typing device (pen & paper ;) and play a little, maybe you'll find something that works good.

Yeah -- but the bot is always forced to cross some waypoints in some routes -- isn't it.
So  for instance, if there is a large hallway the bot is always to end up on waypoints placed in that hallway. So, the bot can vary maybe a little in it's path to that waypoint (by not going in a perfect straight line) but it will always end up at the waypoint..

That's what I'm working on ... without any success however =)

Waypoints (or some other path marker) are required for bots to know how to navigate from one location in the map to another.  Humans also use waypoints when they navigate (it's called memory).  If you couldn't remember things for more that 5 or 10 seconds then you would navigate in much the same way as bots without waypoints do.  You'd randomly wander around until you saw the goal that you were trying to get to.

The problem with bots always taking the same path isn't caused by waypoints.  It's caused by the navigation algorithm.  Some algorithm's (like Dijkstra's algoritihm or the Floyd-Warshall algorithm) always generate the shortest path (assuming that distance is the "weight" used between nodes in a graph).  The shortest path from point A to point Z is always the same (unless you have dynamic landscape, which Half-Life, unlike Red Faction, does not).  These types of navigation algorithms are easier to implement and are thus used more often by bot authors.

If random navigation to a goal was a simple thing, every bot would have this feature.  It's not a simple thing and that's why most bots don't have this kind of advanced navigational skills.

My point is that you should not equate "waypoints" with "non-random navigation".  Even though these are related, having one does not mean that you have to have the other.

well put, Botman.

Conceptually, a waypoint defines not only a point but also a volume: we think of the bot being _at_ a waypoint if he is closer to and within reach of that waypoint than to any other reachable waypoint.
And if, conceptually, a waypoint defines a volume, then, conceptually, all ways of representing terrain (grids, areas, waypoints, cells, polygon, etc.) are similar.
In other words, you are unlikely to avoid the problems you associate with waypoints by moving a volume based representation.

However, you could add another hierarchy of information (describing areas consisting of smaller areas/waypoints/whatever).
