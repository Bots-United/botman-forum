I'm making CS Buying code, but whenever the bot executes it, CS hangs, i.e. it's stuck in a loop somewhere (If it was a NULL pointer it would crash to desktop) and I know the buying code is the prob becuase I commmented it out and the bot worked ok but obviously didn't attempt to buy anything. If you can help me spot where the bot might get stuck in a loop... Please :-)

code:

void BotBuy( bot_t *pBot)
{

  int choice = 0;
  int maxcost = 0;
  bool found_gun = FALSE;
  char menu_select1;
  char menu_select2;
  int select_index;
  edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;

  buy_weapon_t *pSelectBuy = NULL;
  
  pSelectBuy = &cs_buy_weapons[0];    

  //Find a weapon to buy

  if(pSelectBuy)
  {

     select_index = 0;

     while (pSelectBuy[select_index].cost != 0)
     {
         // does the bot have enough cash?

         if ((pBot->bot_weapons & (1<<pSelectBuy[select_index].iId)))   // Does the bot already have this weapon?
         {  
           select_index++;                                    // Skip to next weapon
           continue;            
         }
         if( pBot->bot_money < pSelectBuy[select_index].cost )             // Can the bot afford this weapon ???
         {  
           select_index++;                                    // Skip to next weapon
           continue;            
         }

         if ( pSelectBuy[select_index].cost == 0 )             // Does this weapon have a cost ? (i.e. is it valid?)
         {
           select_index++;                                    // Skip to next weapon

hey, did you compile that piece of code ? I think it shouldn't work, cause it's "strcpy(char *,const char *)" and therefore u won't be able write the numbers to a data element which is only char. 

Another thing is, why do u use this here :

code:

if (pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category == 1)
       strcpy(menu_select1, "1");
     else if (pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category == 2)
       strcpy(menu_select1, "2");
     else if (pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category == 3)
       strcpy(menu_select1, "3");
     else if (pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category == 4)
       strcpy(menu_select1, "4");
     else if (pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category == 5) // Convert these integers to char
       strcpy(menu_select1, "5");
     else if (pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category == 6)
       strcpy(menu_select1, "6");
     else if (pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category == 7)
       strcpy(menu_select1, "7");
     else if (pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category == 8)
       strcpy(menu_select1, "8");



u could just replace it with 
code:

sprintf(menu_select1,"%i",pSelectBuy[choice].menu_category)



( when menu_select1 is a char field )

, but i know that botman used something similar somewhere in his template code too. OK, before u use my code u have still to test if it's a correct number, but i think that's a lot shorter.

integers cannot be used as arguments with the FakeClientCommand.

That's why I had to do that, and why botman had to do that!

It has been compiled, it compiled fine! :)

The main thing I gotta work out is why CS hangs when the function is executed, I beilieve the whil loop has something to do with it :(

code:

char menu_select1;
strcpy(menu_select1, "1"); 



First of all, my compiler does not want this !

explanation : The argument of strcpy has to be a pointer to an array of chars. If u want toset a char variable to a value u can just do menu_select1 ='5';. strcpy copies a string ( the 2nd parameter) to the destination ( 1. parameter ). A so called sz - string as used here has always a 0 at his end. therefore a string containing a "5" for example has the size : sizeof(char) * 2. That's the other reason why ur code above cannot really be clean when u want to write 2 char into one char variable.

And about not being able to pass integers to fakeclientcommand : that's why i converted the integer to a string by this function called sprintf. u might know printf for the screen, this is just the aequivalent for the memory.

Ah oh yeah!!! I forgot about the single quotes meaning just ONE character. I try that, thanks!

I use the MinG compiler... cos my borland compiler doesn't seem to work anymore :(
