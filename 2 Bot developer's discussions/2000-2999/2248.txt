Subject: Aiming at my entity makes it crash half-life

My half-life crashes when I aim at an entity, which I have spawned.

Does anybody know what happens when I aim at something? (e.g. what is executed?)

Any suggestions to what could be wrong ?

Make sure the part of the entity you're trying to point to isn't 'NULL', cause that would cause a crash.

The only thing that comes to my mind right now is the autoaim function. You could probably check that theory by switching off auto-aim (in case that it's enabled) and test if the game still crashes. If it turns out to have something to do with the autoaim you should have a look at AutoaimDeflection() in the CBasePlayer class to check which lines could cause an error with your entity.

Autoaiming is turned off.
I will look into the CBasePlayer class later.

Cheese - Which parts do you mean?

Everything works with the entity except when aiming at it. There might a function, which is called everytime a player points at an entity. Maybe there is some pointer or interception rutine I need to make.

perhaps some parts of the entity that your trying to point to isn't initialised or NULL... causing in  anull pointer assignement + crash..!

Cheese - have you ever tried spawning a thinking entity? Can I see your code if you have?

Nope, I haven't tried it.. 

Sometimes (I think :))thinking entities might not be spawned (or removed from the world) and can still be "thinking". I dunno if that would cause a crash though, usually it would just show an error in the console..
