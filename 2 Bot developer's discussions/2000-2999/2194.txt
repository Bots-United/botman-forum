Is it possible to determine which weapon a player entity is carrying (e.g. using) ?

Is it possible to detect that a player is reloading his weapon (for instance by checking ammo amounts) ?

pBot->current_weapon.iId

I know you can't check how much ammo a player has got but if the iAmmo is 0 then I think it means reloading. else check for the IN_RELOAD setting in pEdict->v.button

Thanks for your reply.

..won't work since I'm not going to do this check on bots but on their enemies. A bot in combat should act diffently if the enemy is using a awp than if he was using a ak47.

But I see that entvar_t contains something called weaponmodel. I could imagine that it would be ok to use that one.

How often do I need to check this to be sure not to miss one out?

Every frame (in Start Frame).

Itsn't there a better way to check whether a player is reloading?

If I check v_button I won't get "forced" reloads like when he fires all the bullets in his clip.

What about the player animation? Can't I use that for something?

If the MOD sends a ClientCommand() to reload then you can just intercept this.  If the MOD code does auto reloading via the weapons code, then, no, the RELOAD bit will NOT be set in the buttons field when this happens.
