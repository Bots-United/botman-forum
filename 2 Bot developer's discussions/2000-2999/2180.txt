Hi...

The bots I created seems to have a problem shooting. They do shoot, but not at the direction of the enemy, but at a different direction.

I have been trying to check the code of the BotShooAtEnemy and I didn't change anything inside there.

However, the bot do shoot precisely sometimes, but after a while their aiming runs away.

Any help would be appreciated.

Do you mean that they don't hit the target or do you mean that they don't look like they are aiming in the correct direction even though they do hit the target (i.e. the player model doesn't appear to be aiming at what they are shooting at)?

If you've messed about with the bots v_angle (pBot->pEdict->v.v_angle) anywhere then this might happen

Well..

They dont hit the target and the player model is NOT facing the target correctly.

They sometimes face a different direction and shoot all the way, but none of the bullets hit the enemy(they go sideways).

But sometimes they do work..

BTW I am setting the bot_speed to 0.0( so they dont move while shooting).

are you sure you have called the FixIdealYaw() functions anywhere you are changing the ideal_yaw?

well...

I have check the BotShootAtEnemy function( coz there is where they change yaw) and yes they have that fix ideal yaw. 

Question
1) Does the BotShootAtEnemy determined where to shoot at the enemy and the movement when seeing an enemy?

Anyway thanks for helping out...

In the default HPB bot template code, BotShootAtEnemy() is being called every frame when the bot has an enemy (pEnemy pointer is not NULL).  BotShootAtEnemy() is constantly re-aiming at the enemy if they move.  When it is time to fire BotShootAtEnemy() will call BotFireWeapon() to fire the weapon at the enemy.

I suggest you copy this function from the template source code into your code to restore the default behavior if you have edited that code.  Also perhaps you aren't calling BotShootAtEnemy() every frame.

That function should probably be renamed to BotAimAtEnemy() since the bot doesn't always shoot every time it gets called, but it does keep adjusting the aim.
