Is there something special I must do when changing the my_entity->v.movetype to apply the changes?

If you change the movetype in anything, it will probably reset to what it's supposed to be by the HL engine. I *think

Well, I knew it could be done. The Counterstrike mod does it when players climbs ladders. Then they change movetype from MOVETYPE_WALK to MOVETYPE_FLY.

All I have to do is to call pfnSetOrigin.

The Counter-Strike MOD does not change this.  The Half-Life engine does (when a player touches a func_ladder, i.e. something with pev->skin = CONTENTS_LADDER).
