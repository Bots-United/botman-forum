yo, newbie modder needs a lil help with compiling Client.dll & mp.dll, thing is...i do have Visual c++, but its the evaluation version...which wont allow me to disable Inline function expansion...hence my client.dll builds wont work,
so i was wondering has anyone here successfully built a client.dll or mp.dll with one of the free compilers available?
I was reading the part about mingW32 in thew faq, but it doesnt explain how to compile the client.dll ?

Because of the VGUI library (built with Microsoft Visual C++), no other C++ compiler can be used to build the client.dll except MSVC.

If Valve ever releases the source code to the VGUI library then the client.dll might be able to be built with other compilers (MingW32 or Borland).
