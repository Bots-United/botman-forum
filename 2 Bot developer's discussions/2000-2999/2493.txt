Grr, for some reason, after I kick a bot (with the kick console command) they are still "there."  If I go into observer mode I can lock onto them, they don't move, and are invisible, and the observer mode says their name is (null).  Anyone have a clue of where I could start solving this problem, thanks.  Talk to you later everyone!

What MOD is this for? I've got a similar thing with my bot but it uses a different spectate mode. Although the same happens when playing real clients on the MOD I do mine for, so I don't really bother about it.

perhaps you are still trying to show a clients name where the client does not exist. You could maybe check (pEdict->free) to check if it doesn't exist. I don't think client slots are not null at all so you'll have to check it by seeing if its free or not. :)

Well, the problem is that it spectates the bot/player when they aren't even in the game.  Err... I wish I could describe it...
