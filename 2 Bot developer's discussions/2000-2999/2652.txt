Im trying to get my bot spawning in 1016, like Pikachu was trying to, and I guess I've encountered the same problem.. The bot doesnt get set as a fakeclient in the startfram.. And therefore the mod sends msg_one packets to it, which causes HL to crash.. 

This is what i presume.. If anyone know how to solve this please reply :)
