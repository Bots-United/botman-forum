I've tried UTIL_GetTeam But either its returning the wrong team or nothing...!!!! Can you tell me what number it returns if the bot is on the terrorists and the number returned if the bot is on the counter-terrorists? I thought it was 0 and 1, but they dont work!

Yes, if the player model the bot is using is...

"terror", "arab", "leet", "artic", or "guerilla" (the terrorists) it will return 0

"urban", "gsg9", "sas", "gign", or "vip" (counter-terrorists and civilian) it will return 1

...note that "artic" is spelled incorrectly (according to gooseman).  It should be "arctic".  This bug won't actually make any difference because any unknown models will also return 0 (same as terrorists).
