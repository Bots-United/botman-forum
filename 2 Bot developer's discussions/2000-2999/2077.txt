hi...

I have some problem with ducking when I checked when the bot is stuck. 

It seems like when it is stuck, the bots seems to jump up when it is suppose to duck( because there is some space for it to duck).

I have look up the code and it seems that the bot is stuck code is executed every second(or less) but not on every frame.

Can anyone solve this?

When you are trying to get them to duck, are you HOLDING down the duck key (i.e. setting IN_DUCK during EVERY frame)?
