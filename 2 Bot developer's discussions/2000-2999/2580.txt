I was wondering if you could help me out
One of the modules for my degree requires me to conduct some research. I have made a questionnaire on the subject of "Game AI". I would really appreciate it if you could pass the URL on to any programmers whom you might know  It should only take about 10 minutes to complete. And I do want the opinions of Pro developers, mod makers, Programming academics etc etc. So if you know someone who is even vaguely interested in the subject of game AI them give em the link!

Hi Mark,

I think this is a fun way of doing some research. However, you probably should:
- improve the questionaire
- then post the request to news:comp.ai.games and the AI discussion forum of www.igda.org

wrt to the questionairre:
could you:
- add definitions of fixed state, fuzzy state, and object orientated? (I guess you mean 'state machine based', 'fuzzy state machine based', and you intend to write 'object oriented'. OO isn't a style of AI; for example, Half-Life combines an OO implementation of the game logic with FSM based AI for individuals and teams).
- add definition of adaptive AI
- explain why the questionnaire is this heavy on 'adaptive' AI (you're looking for something, I guess)
- add the option 'not applicable/don't know' to each game genre for question: most AI developers are pretty specialized in one or two genres, and don't have a clue about the issues in the other genres. If you force them to guess, the resulting answers may not be very reliable.
- does strategy include both 'real-time strategy' and turn-based wargames / boardgames?

Thanks for your comments William.  I have already posted the URL on IGDA and comp.ai.games, but thanks for the suggestions.
I apologise if any of my questions seem poorly written, I have only a passing familiarity with the subject and I dont want the questionaire to get too long or complex.

as to your suggestions:
I will add definitions as you suggest.

ps. Ive removed the validation so the questionnaire should now work (flippin Javascript)

I believe here are examples off OO implementation of AI.  The sims uses an OO approach.  The sims themselves have relatively simple desires, whilst objects broadcast various messages eg a food broadcasts "I will satisfy your hunger", and a microwave brodcasts "I will make your food more satisfying", a hungry sim would first respond to the foods message - to satisfy its hunger and then the microwaves message - to make the food more satisfying.  

The title of the page explains why the questionnaire is heavy on Adaptive AI "Will Adaptive AI become the preferred method of AI within the next 5 years?"

I deliberately left out the dont know/not applicable, I am looking for opinions, whether these opinions are wrong, wildly off or unreliable is not relevant.  Im guessing that these opinions will differ depending upon occupation and specialisation.  Id like to find out how

Strategy does include turn based and board games but I was primarily thinking of real time.
