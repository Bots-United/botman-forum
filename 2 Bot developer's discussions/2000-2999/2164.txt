Somehow, when i add more then 13 bots the game (listen server and dedicated) just freezes. I cant find out how. I tried debug, but that doesnt help either. I have to break the program, but then it asks me for ASM fils and such. Is there a way to detect this bug? 

I have tried several manners on finding out the bug. When adding more then 13 bots, it simply freezes! And thats driving me nuts! I rather have a message or something, cause then i know atleast something. I cant tell if this bug is old or not.

Could anybody help me on this one?

okay! i fixed it! It seemed i had an infinite loop when checking for double names. It seemed i had only 13 names in my list of names, so the function actually just did as i programmed it to:

FunctionAddABot()
{
char name;

while (no double name found)
{

}

}

i forgot to add the 'amount of tries' so when the program realizes he tried all names but still didnt got one , then he will just pick a name and will have a double name after all.

Sorry!
Btw, i could find it out with the debugger. I simply pressed CANCEL when the debugger asked for information. And then i pressed F11, i could browse through the assembly code and sometimes i saw an own line of code! This is how i knew it was that function...

This could be of some help for debuggers around here! :D
