Hi Botman...

I tried using UTIL_GetBotPointer() function to return a pointer to a bot_t obj in the bots[] but it seems like it crashes, I checked the code and it looks fine to me. But when I checked the value of the return result, it was zero.

So can u pls help..

If UTIL_GetBotPointer() returns NULL then that is the indication that the edict value you are passing it is not a bot (hence no bot_t structure is available).  Do not try to dereference this pointer (use it) without checking for NULL first like so...
code:
void DoSomeBotStuff(edict_t *pEdict)
{
   bot_t *pBot;

   pBot = UTIL_GetBotPointer(pEdict);

   if (pBot != NULL)
   {
      // bot stuff here...
      if (pBot->f_whatever <= gpGlobals->time)
      {
         // time to do whatever
      }

      pBot->count_of_stuff++;
   }

   // if not a bot then just return
   return;
}

HI...ok that solves the prob

But lets say i want to find information on real players and not a bot...is all those information stored in the entwars_t structure or is there any other place where I can find them...

Do a search for all clients in the game (gpGlobals->MaxClients). A for loop will suffice.

You'll need to find the entity which is at the index of the loop so you can edit this entity.

e.g. by using: edict_t *pPlayer = INDEXENT(i);

Check to see if the clients flag is "FL_CLIENT" which will mean it is an actual human player.

Then do your stuff to pPlayer...!!!
