What do you mean "How to start"?  Do you mean "How do you run the compiler?", just add the MinGW\bin directory to your MS-DOS command line path and use "gcc" (without the quotes) to compile a C or C++ source file.

There is documentation on the MinGW webpage...

I've tried that but MS-DOS says
GCC.EXE : No input files.
What to do?

oh, s***...

This is a <b>command-line</b> compiler. NOT an IDE.

That means, you won't have a window popped up with a nice colorful C++ editor and lots of fancy stuff in toolbar buttons.

gcc works the same way that Microsoft's compiler cl.exe works. For gcc though, either you compile a single source file (for example: gcc myprog.c), or to compile big projects with lots of files in it, you need to run a Makefile. To do this, you mustn't call gcc directly, but the 'make' program, that will build up all the stuff for you with the good options.

If you do this:
code:

// myprog.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
   printf ("Hello world!\n");
   return 0;
}


C:\MINGW32\GCC.EXE MYPROG.C
it will compile a file called MYPROG.EXE. Simple, neat: myprog.c->myprog.exe

If you want to build a more complex project such as the HPB bot template, you HAVE to use gmake.
C:\HPBTEMP3\SRC\MAKE.EXE
it will read a file called Makefile, that contains all the directives to build up such a complex project for you.

However, I urge you to read tutorials and books about the C before attempting to start anything... And IMHO you'd better start with an IDE such as MS Visual Studio.
