Hey


Ive got a little theory, and I don't know if it's possible..So I would just like your opinion.

Do you think it is possible to use the hpb_bot technology to load an old sdk 1.0 dll into HL 1108, by getting the "hpb_bot.dll" to load it
and just "copy" the new sdk functions into the "hpb_bot.dll" instead of wrapping them. Then it would load the old game code but still get the new functions...

Then it would be possible to play cs 5.2 in the newest HL patch and add bots to it too...


In case you cant understand me Im willing to write a more complex description of what Im saying :)

Yes, since none of the older engine functions have changed between HL 1.0.1.6 (SDK 1.0) and HL 1.1.0.0 (SDK 2.0+), it should be possible to load and older MOD DLL file and provide the proper interface to the engine in the Add-On DLL (while providing the old SDK 1.0 interface to the older MOD DLL).

Give it a try and let us know what you find out.

Ah, yes... I knew it had to work :P


I'll see what I can do about it..

Anyone have any other info I might need/find useful ? 

Got a list of the new functions ?

I didn't say it "had to work".

"Got a list of the new functions?"

Download the SDK 1.0 source code and install it.  Download the SDK 2.0 or SDK 2.1 source code and install it.  Ignore everything in the cl_dll or dlls folders.  Use www.scootersoftware.comBeyondCompare to compare the .h files in the "common", "engine" and "pm_shared" directory.  The only ones I'd worry about right away are the ones in the engine directory (specifically eiface.h).

Yea, I know, but I was trying to save some time :P


anyway, I'll start when I get home today, if I find a new keyboard lying around.. I broke it yesterday :)

Its me again, Ive been comparing the eiface.h files, and I find the new functions declared there, BUT the source for those functions isnt in the sdk, as far as I can tell

So, would you care to help me even more ? :)

The source for those functions is in the engine, not the SDK.  The MOD will call those engine functions, but not all of those functions are used in the SDK (some are only used for Counter-Strike and TFC and other MODs that need them).

You just need to make sure that the older DLL has access to all of the older eiface.h functions that it needs and don't worry about the new engine functions (since the MOD won't know about them anyway).

how am I supposed to let them have access to the old functions, aren't they already there ?

when I try to link it without any other difference with the hpb_bot it just says "the dll is outdated"

I think that the old funcs are updated i dont think that they just add new in later verisions...

Look in dll.cpp at the GetEntityAPI() function.  The Half-Life engine passes in "interfaceVersion" and the code checks for a SPECIFIC engine version.  If the versions don't match, it returns FALSE telling the engine this DLL is the WRONG VERSION.  You'll need to change it so that YOUR GetEntityAPI function accepts the new engine value BUT then passes the OLD engine value to the old DLL code.  This is also used in the GetNewDLLFunctions(), but old DLL code doesn't use that so you don't need to pass it on to the MOD DLL code.

Ok, I've been a little busy lately so I havent tried this before today.

So far I've just commented out the dll version check. But I don't know how to pass the OLD engine value to the old DLL code as you say, I'll read through the hpbtemplate readme again today and see if I might understand it better then.

Just an idea......

In case of success, could you check if you can play standard Half-Life (the storyline) and if this solve the problem with the train at the very start of the game (barney not getting triggered) ?

If this works, I'll rush and download SDK 1.0 !!

oh, I forgot.

You should hack your GetEntityApi() function a bit and log the interfaceVersion variable in a file to see how it looks when it gets called. Then insert some arbitrary value for this variable to be returned, and it should be all I think.

or simply do
code:

// interface version is 1 for the shareware version and 140 for 1.1.0.8
#define INTERFACE_VERSION 140

extern "C" EXPORT int GetEntityAPI (DLL_FUNCTIONS *pFunctionTable, int interfaceVersion)
{
   // check if engine's pointer is valid and version is correct...
   // this was: if  (!pFunctionTable || interfaceVersion != INTERFACE_VERSION)
   if (!pFunctionTable)
      return FALSE;

   // pass engine callback function table to engine...
   memcpy (pFunctionTable, &gFunctionTable, sizeof (DLL_FUNCTIONS));

   // pass other DLLs engine callbacks to function table...
   if (!(*other_GetEntityAPI) (&other_gFunctionTable, INTERFACE_VERSION))
      return FALSE; // error initializing function table!

   return TRUE;
}



This should work, doesn't it ?

well, your new GetEntityApi() does the exact same thing as the original, except the version checking... which ive removed ages ago :P

I just dont know how to pass the old engine value to the old dll code so that the dll will load..

I guess I have to something like
code:

// pass engine callback function table to engine...
  memcpy (pFunctionTable, &gFunctionTable, sizeof (DLL_FUNCTIONS));



but, I just don't know what to do, I'm kind of stranded..

Btw, what barney bug were you talking about ?

try to start a single-player game with Half-Life and HPB bot. Your player will get stuck in the train that is at the beginning of the game because of the guard not coming to open the door.

btw, I don't understand what your problem is.
You just need the right INTERFACE_VERSION value, right ? Why wouldn't this suffice ?

the problem is that I want to load old mods, like CS beta 5.2

and to do that I have to bypass the interface check, which I've done, BUT I also need to send the OLD interfaceversion to the OLD dll or the dll wont load.

which value do you use for #define INTERFACE_VERSION ?

It wont work because the old SDK didn't work with FAKECLIENTS i.e. no bots could work with it... at least i think that :)

SDK 1.0 will work fine with bots.  My Bot Numbers 1 through 7 were built using SDK 1.0.  You will need Half-Life engine version 1.0.1.3 - 1.0.1.6.  Fake clients weren't supported in the Half-Life engine until version 1.0.1.3.  SDK 2.0 came out with Half-Life version 1.1.0.0.  Half-Life engine 1.0.1.6 was the last version before SDK 2.0 came out.  Counter-Strike Beta 5.x was around the time of Half-Life engine 1.0.1.6 and SDK 1.0.

"This should work, doesn't it ?"

The sizes of the function pointer arrays are different in different releases of the SDK (newer versions of the SDK have more engine functions).  You can pass back MORE data than that particular version of the engine expects or it will crash.  You need to have the version of the SDK that corresponds to the version of the engine that you are using (i.e. released about the same time) and only pass back the function pointers for that version of the SDK.

Cheese : even if it didn't support bots I wouldn't care, because bots aren't what I'm trying to make here :P

Botman : have you tried getting HL to load cstrike 5.2 ? it's a long time since I halted this project because I couldn't get it to work.

Nope, I don't play Counter-Strike, so I'm not going to spend my time trying to get an old version of Counter-Strike running with the latest version of Half-Life.

But what about TFC 1.0 ? you do like that, don't you ? :P

Botmans Bot Version 8 works but a bit strange so you can play deatmatch in cs_maps.
