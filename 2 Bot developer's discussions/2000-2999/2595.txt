I need help with checking the ammo held by bots.

I'm using the same method to hold the ammo that botman used in the HPBBot template.

I want to check to see if a player has used some ammo. I done this in a similar function to BotThink called in startframe..

code:

      if( players->previous_iClip > player->current_weapon.iClip )
      {
            if( player->previous_iId == player->current_weapon.iId )
            {
                  player->shots_fired = player->shots_fired + (player->previous_iClip - player->current_weapon.iClip);
            }
      }

      player->previous_iClip = player->current_weapon.iClip;
      player->previous_iId = player->current_weapon.iId;



But things are annoyingly wrong all the time.. Mostly it never works as iClip seems to be -1 a lot of the time (as bots tend to choose the knife!!) Or the previos clip seems to be less than the current clip. Or am I using the wrong method to check the ammo?

I've also tried this..
code:

      if( player->previous_iId == player->current_weapon.iId )
      {
            if( player->previous_iClip > player->m_rgAmmo[weapon_defs[player->current_weapon.iId].iAmmo1] )
            {
                  player->shots_fired = player->shots_fired + (player->previous_iClip - player->m_rgAmmo[weapon_defs[player->current_weapon.iId].iAmmo1]);
            }
      }



But for some reason "player->m_rgAmmo[weapon_defs[player->current_weapon.iId].iAmmo1])" is sometimes ZERO when the last time I checked it, it was TEN or something. Argghh!

int ammo_for_current_gun = player->current_weapon.iAmmo1; // :)

That should work
