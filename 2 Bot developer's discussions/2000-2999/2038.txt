I was wondering a little about enforcing file consistency:

Why, even if you enforce file consistency, do custom model skins get through?

Can you try to enforce a file that doesnt exist?(ex: want to make sure it doesnt exist on client)

Can you enforce files outside of half-life directory?(like, anywhere in PATH)

I am working on implementing anti-cheat stuff like "The Opera" for Ultimate Paintball Mod

Im no expert on this, however I believe that enforcing the consistency of a model is done by its bounds and it is possible to still use hacked models. there is no way of checking that the client has files or not without client.dll coding, which if you are making an anti cheat server mod, is impossible. This same rule applies to enforcing files outside the HL directory. Although you could force the user to download a file if they didnt have it by using .res files.

If its your own mod you are doing this too (not a sub mod for anyone elses) then the file checking stuff should be completly possible.

If you are creating your own MOD then you can do anything you want in the client.dll code (well, almost anything you want).

There is the ENGINE_FORCE_UNMODIFIED() (pfnForceUnmodified) that will compare files between the client and the server to see if they are the same.  My understanding of this is that it compares the CRC (or MD5) of the two files to see if they are the same.  Also I believe that it can only be used for models (not sprites or sounds).  There was a discussion about ENGINE_FORCE_UNMODIFIED on the hlcoders list at www.topica.com...

I suggest you read the replies to this post for more information.

If you just want to check if certain files exist on the client you can add code to the client.dll to look for these files.  Something as simple as stat() can be used to do this (provided you know the pathname and filename beforehand).

You could search through the PATH environment directories if you wanted to check if a file did or didn't exist anywhere in the PATH (but I'm not sure what use this would be since executeables can be executed without being in the PATH when given the full pathname to the executable).

If you aren't creating your own MOD and wish to implement some file checking system you can use something like PunkBuster, where you have a server and a client that communicate with each other via a TCP/IP sockets connection.  The server could be an Add-on type DLL (similar to the HPB bot) that would prevent the client from connecting to the server unless the client has been authenticated by the server.

yes, i am creating the mod(Ultimate Paintball).  The reason im doing this, as im sure you guessed, is for anticheat purposes.  I want to find things such as OpenGL32.dll wrappers, client.dll hacks, custom crosshairs, and custom models.
