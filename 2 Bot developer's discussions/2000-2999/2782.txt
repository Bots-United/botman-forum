I've tried to just cut and paste the code in, that doesn't work.  

I've tried to port over a few basic functions( WaypointAdd, WaypointFindNearest, etc. ), that didnt work.  I tried copying just the waypoint.h file over( harmless right... ), and i get a whole butt-load of errors just for including the file( a few about edict_t but i fixed those ) 102 to be exact.  

My next attempt will be to start from scratch :( with a simple WAYPOINT type and create the functions from scratch also.  

I'm thinking about putting them in player.cpp or client.cpp.  If you have a better way, that would be great. 

Why not just use HPB?  Well I like being able to access player variables instead of capturing messages.  

Your help and time is appreciated!

Nevermind, even though you all seem to ignore my posts :(, i figured it out myself.  All the HPB waypoint code is pretty self contained.  

Does any one have the first HPB bot source?  I need a simpler botheadtowardwaypoint function than in the full source and template 2 & 3 don't have that code...
