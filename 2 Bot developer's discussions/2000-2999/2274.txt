Hello again,

     I want my CS bot to drop a bomb at the given target.  He's already been able to find it and move there.  I just don't really know how to select the bomb. UTIL_Select_Item() I assume might work but there isn't an entry for the bomb in the weapons chart.  How would I go about accomplishing my goal?  How would I add a new weapon item?  Thanks a lot.

Robert

To find out things like this, do the following.

1. Start up a server and join the game.

2. Pull down the console and enter "debug_engine" (without the quotes).

3. Perform the action you are interested in (in this case plant a bomb).

4. Exit from the game.

5. Look at the "bot.txt" file found in the Half-Life directory and search for "ClientCommand" to see which commands have been sent from the client to the server.  The last command sent is probably the one you want.

hehe - 5) No, that command would probably be quit :-)

Robert - you can always make a fakeclientcommand - weapon_c4 changes weapon to bomb in counterstrike.

In the pfnCreateEntity function you'll have to wait until an entity with the model setted to "models/w_c4.mdl" is spawned - this is when the bot is finished placing the bomb.

(Or you could wait for textmsg (type 75) with a string "#Bomb_Planted")

The bomb has exploded when you receive a textmsg (type 75) with a string "#Target_Bombed")

I've been working on this today infact. I've already got the bot to plant the bomb, but I wanted the other bots to know if the bomb has been planet so CTs will know that it has to be defused...

I made this

botclient.cpp

code:

void BotClient_CS_TextMessage(void *p, int bot_index)
{
   static int state = 0;   // current state machine state


   ALERT( at_console, "\nText Message occured!!!!" );

   if (state == 0)
   {
      state++;      
   }
   else if (state == 1)
   {
      state = 0;

        if (strcmp((char *)p, "#Bomb_Planted") == 0)
        {
              ALERT( at_console, "\nSet Bomb planted to TRUE!!!!" );
              bots[bot_index].bomb_planted = TRUE;
        }
   }
}



somewhere in engine.cpp

code:

      else if (msg_dest == MSG_ALL)
      {
         ...
         ...

         else if (mod_id == CSTRIKE_DLL)
         {
            if (msg_type == message_DeathMsg)
               botMsgFunction = BotClient_CS_DeathMsg;
          else if (msg_type == message_TextMessage)
             botMsgFunction = BotClient_CS_TextMessage;
         }
       ...
       ...
      }



oh yah, this has also gotta go in engine.cpp

code:

      else if (mod_id == CSTRIKE_DLL)
      {
         if (strcmp(pszName, "VGUIMenu") == 0)
            message_VGUI = msg;
         ...
         ...
            message_Money = msg;
         else if (strcmp(pszName, "DeathMsg") == 0)
            message_DeathMsg = msg;
         else if (strcmp(pszName, "ScreenFade") == 0)
            message_ScreenFade = msg;
         else if (strcmp(pszName, "TextMsg") == 0)
            message_TextMessage = msg;



There are some other things ya gotta do in the client and engine code. Read botmans readme.txt about it in the templates readme.
