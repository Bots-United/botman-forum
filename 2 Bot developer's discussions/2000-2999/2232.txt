WHAT exactly do you mean by "waypionts for bot lasers"???

Are you asking about waypoints that can be used to fire a laser weapon???  (this makes NO sense what-so-ever).

Are you asking about waypoints that are drawn using the temporary entity (TE) that lasers use???

Explain, IN DETAIL, what you want.

A lightning/laser gun?

I'm not sure whether it's possible to create your own weapon for a mod thru a bot's dll.

maybe he wants to have all players shoot out lasers all ways? like a cheat program? i know this wont work when you are client as the bot code is server side.

anywayz, making own weapons... don't know.
