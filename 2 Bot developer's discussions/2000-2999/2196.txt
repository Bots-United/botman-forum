how can you get the current speed of ANY entity? i triad v.speed but it always returns 0

I'm sure v.speed worked fine with me. I tried making my bots shoot enemies worse if the enemies speed was greater and the bots had really crap accuracy so I guess it worked ;) Although maybe it was something else!

If you've got problems with v.speed use v.velocity.Length()
