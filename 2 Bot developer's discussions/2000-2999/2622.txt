Before going through the pain of writing a vgui menu as complex as I need for one of my bots. I want to write the code for the menus in the same dll as the bot not in client dll but in the server side just wanted to know if this is possible. I remeber earlier last year I tried but never finnished or tested. Now I cant find the code so I have to start over :P.
