I read botmans description on how to stop bots circling waypoints but it wasn't working for me... I posted this earlier saying I had a problem but I found the prob *ithink* and Ill leave this post for anyone with the same probs. The MOD im using, the bots can change into monsters and can run very fast, this makes the loop problem worse as the bots are going to fast and will think they miss waypoints.

This is the base code I used using botmans description at http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=1138

code:


  if(distance < BOT_WPT_TOUCH)
        touched_wpt = TRUE;
  else if (distance > pBot->previous_distance)
  {
        touched_wpt = TRUE;
  }
  else
        touched_wpt = FALSE;


      if (touched_wpt)
      {              
            pBot->previous_distance = 9999;

             // Carry out more code here...
        }
else
{
  previous_distance = distance;

  // Carry out more code here...

}

Try this: (cur_waypoint = bot's current waypoint)

code:

edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;
int next_waypoint = WaypointRouteFromTo(cur_waypoint,goal_waypoint,-1);
float dist1 = (waypoints[next_waypoint].origin - pEdict->v.origin).Length();
float dist2 = (waypoints[next_waypoint].origin - waypoints[cur_waypoint].origin).Length();

if (dist1 < dist2) touched_wpt = TRUE;
