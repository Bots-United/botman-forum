is there any known bug between sdk2.2 and bot template 3 ? 

exactly i mean the client side code.

i used the 2.1 client.dll it works fine, but with 2.2 it will crash when the bot comes in.

both dlls runs under mp.dll 2.2.

there is no client side bot code, so what is wrong ? :(

The only crashing problems I am aware of are if you try to use pfnClientCommand() or pfnClientPrintf() with bot edicts.  The latest version of TFC was causing the HPB bot to crash when bots were hit by gas grenades.  The hallucination effects caused the game to crash (since the MOD DLL used pfnClientCommand to play .wav files).

If you block pfnClientCommand() and pfnClientPrintf() for any edict with FL_FAKECLIENT set in the flags field it should prevent this specific crashing problem.

Other than that, there's nothing else that I'm aware of with the Template #3 source code that would cause crashing problems.

hm, sorry?! i found the problem. 

its not the bot, it is the player model. i use one standart player models and some custom models from cs ( like http://csnation.counter-strike.net/custom-section/custom_section/models/player5.htm ) . 

and the custom models makes the trouble in 2.2 :(.
it will never crash with the original cs model.

ok, thats not a bot problem, but thanks for the answer.
