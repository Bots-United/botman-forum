Yeah my bot does not use waypoints at all since I coded that a few hours ago. The bot does not even eat any memory on my computer(PII,664 Mhz)but the bot is somewhat breaking vents whenever it sees one and freezes. I didnt even code breaking stuff in??? I used the debugger and it didnt find any bugs. Im thinking its the no-waypoint code thats making this action happen. I dont want to use waypoints though so could someone help?

INTERSTING
have you tried it with waypoints to see if it still happens.

Check to see in your code whenever the bots action button is IN_ATTACK i.e. it is attacking (pressing attack button)

It should only occur twice in your whole bot code. Once for respawning and another for attacking enemies.

Also check what bot template you are using...
(HPB, TEAM or flamer)...
