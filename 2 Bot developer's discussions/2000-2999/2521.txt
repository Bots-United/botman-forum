Hello,

I read on a previous post that someone was trying to make a client-side bot, reverse engineering HL's network protocol. Does anybody knows if he succeeded, or what is the current development status?

Thanx for your help,

  Victor

I think the current client side bot evolved into client side cheats (aimbot, wall hacks, radar hacks, etc.).

I think the reason the client side bot never appeared was that there wasn't enough information about the location of entities and players on the client side to make the bot behave as well as it could using the engine functions available on the server side.  For example, you can't loop through a list of all the entites to find their origins on the client side, but you can do this on the server side.

P.S. If this thread digresses into a discussion about how to create client side cheats, I'll just delete it.

You can do it on all entitys in your PVS..

There are client.dll wrappers/hooks which allow you to change the client.dll alot of the stuff in them are aimbots, and stuff, but also some cheat detection, its worth a look into if you are an experienced programmer, and just want to experiement..but i suggest nothing public..

Is there an easy way to at least get all seen players / items / walls around the player? Do you know where I can get more info on this? (and dont worry, I dont want to create any client side cheats, I just want to make a cool bot :-)...)

Thanx,

Like Reductor said, the entities within the PVS are sent to the client.  The client function gEngfuncs.GetEntityByIndex() can be used to loop through all the client entities.

World brushes (walls) aren't entities and you can't find them this way.  func_wall's are entities and you can find them (used for doors, lifts, etc.).

You might want to use www.google.com to search for "Half-Life client bot".  It should lead you to other web sites with information.

I find the best way for entitys that aren't sent to the client, like walls and stuff, during the initlising stage, load the map, prase the epairs from the entity lump, and store the entitys you want in a global array, some where, that will make it easier for looking up class names, and things like that...
