Hello everyone, I am having trouble with the FakeClientCommand.  I was thinking that it could be used to execute any of the commands from the config.cfg listing for a given mod but it isn't working for me.  I am trying basic stuff like

FakeClientCommand(pBot->pEdict, "invnext", "", "");

and

FakeClientCommand(pBot->pEdict, "+attack", "", "");

I was using NULL, NULL as my last two parameters but it was causing the system to crash by not initializing parts of a string.  Well aparently I don't know what I am doing so if someone could help me out I would really apreciate it.

Thanks,
Andrew

right now i dunno what invnext means, but +attack doesn't work, because you have to pass the buttons the bot presses to pfnRunPlayerMove. Look into the template code, I think there is something like bot_t::buttons or similar.

invnext is supposed to change to the next inventory (weapon). But this won't work with bots.

If you want to change to the nextweapon, look at the table in bot_combat.cpp that botman cleverly made. And look at the way he changes the weapon in the code in bot_combat.cpp using UTIL_SelectItem (which just calls FakeClientCommand itself).

For a list of the IN_ buttons look at in_buttons.h

Look in the HPB_Bot_template readme for use.

Some of the commands in the config.cfg file are actually executed on the client (they don't get sent to the server or they get sent to the server as a completely different command).  "invnext" is one of those types of commands.  Since the client is keeping track of which weapons are available for that player, the client code will cycle to the next weapon then send the "weapon_whatever" command to the server to allow that player to select that weapon.

Hey you guys are great with the fast responses =)  Thanks a bunch.  I guess I was just wrong in assuming that the FakeClientCommand had a more general purpose then it actually does.

Thanks,
Andrew
