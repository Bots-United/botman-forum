I have jus added support for DMC i have added all weapons and so + skin support... It is no new skins to DMC so it is the same skin code as in Valve (HL)... But i dont think the bots joina... I dont see them at least when i run around...

I think the problem is the dis of the map when u join the game... I dont think the bot press ok in the start that why... PLZ help me

This is the Join Code:
code:

 else if (mod_id == DMC_DLL)
   {
      
     
         FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "menuselect", c_class, NULL);

         // bot has now joined the game (doesn't need to be started)
         pBot->not_started = 0;

         return;
      
   }

The bot needs to send "_firstspawn" to join the game in DMC....
code:
FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "_firstspawn", NULL, NULL);
