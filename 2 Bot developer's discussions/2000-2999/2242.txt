Hi...

I was wondering how much the model can turn in one direction while still moving in another different direction.

I wanted the bot to fire in one direction while running in another direction. For example the bot is running while firing to his left or right.

And how do we code that?

Thanks

You should aim one direction and move another direction by strafing.  Use the "Search" above to search for "strafe" or "strafing".

You will want to set the "sidemove" argument of pfnRunPlayerMove() to a positive or negtive value to strafe right or left (respectively) while aiming a different direction.
