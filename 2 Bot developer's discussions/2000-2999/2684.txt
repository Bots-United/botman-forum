I've got bots buying grenades and throwing them.  Question: When is a good situation to have a bot throw a grenade?  Right now I just have a bot randomly decide to throw a grenade at a visible enemy, but mostly shoots its gun at the enemy.

I think a good time to throw a grenade is if the bot cannot see the enemy or there is a group of enemies close together

When a once visible enemy suddnely hides, throw a grenade to the last seen position

Im still working away quietly. Heres my approach to grenade useage:

The bots store the locations and times they last saw each enemy in an array for each team. If the bot is in a position where they can grenade an area where the enemy was seen, and the information is less than 5 to 10 seconds old, then do it. When a friendly bot arrives in that area, it is 'clear' and the bot sounds a sector clear message, updating the team information array too. This information is also updated when that particular enemy is seen again elsewhere.

(I only go through this if the given enemy isnt plainly visible)

Sounds much like the old POD method to me ;)
Just teasing, welcome back DY !

There's 1 drawback I didn't like about that way, the Bots use the grenades defensively - they only react to an enemy seen by another Player. I'd think humans also throw grenades as some kind of precaution before they even spotted an enemy.

I finally figured I'd start frequenting here again, I've been playing a lot of CS + HL on the school lan and Im thinking of putting this back towards the top of my pile, instead of the few hours a week I ususally put in :)

I think the offensive grenading thing is a good point, but I think if the enemy isn't plainly visible, then its quite safe to use a gren where you last saw them, in this case it could be interperated as a method to flush the enemy out.

for offensive grenade throwing,  a possible way would be to store in an array where lots off danger (fights) where, also store the time when it happened. Lets say the first 10 seconds a lot of bots die at a specific spot, then it could (notice, COULD) be sensefull to throw a grenade into that area first next time...

The type of area that you throw a grenade into also matters. In wide open spaces, grenades are ineffective. In small rooms or alleys, with few exits, grenades are much more effective.

You can find some other tactical grenade considerations in page 13 to 17 in:

William you're overestimating us (at least I feel stupid everytime I'm reading a new design document from you, hehe). The problem most of us have is that we don't have the source code of the game like you have for CGF (it's a MOD for AQ2 for those who don't know). So you know about the game physics and you're able to do lots of stuff without experimenting. At the moment I have to confess that all this reinforced learning and genetic algos are way over my head :(
Also there's the problem that in my case the Bots don't use waypoints when in attack mode so they are not necessarily near a waypoint. A very simplicistic (spelling?) way I found to be working fairly good was to modify the existing routines in HL and tweak them that way that bouncing (with an additional dot product check for bad directions) is ok for the 2nd part of a throw. Reasoning about throwing again is simple and is done by checking if enemy is out of sight, at a hard to be reached location or will be coming into sight soon (a precalculated visibility table and path prediction is used for that). There's also reasoning about which type of grenade usage to achieve the best effect (throwing or lobbing). However no reasoning about terrain is made (except for certain terrain types like not throwing grens into water or at ppl in the air/on ladders). Area classification also would be worthy but I found it quite hard to evaluate it automatically. Also it's not using lookup tables (except for the mentioned Vis LUT).

I understood most of the document doesn't apply to CS; that's why I mentioned the specific pages that focus on why and when to throw grenades.

You actually do not need automated area classification (especially in _your case_, CF :) ). Any other way of marking areas or flagging waypoints will do.

Anyway, the reasoning you describe already covers 80% of the cases. I doubt that the player will notice the other cases, but an additional waypoint flag would do the job. (For example, does a T bot toss a grenade into the 2nd de_dust T-junction when rushing to the nearest bomb site?)

The thing not discussed on this page are smoke and flashbang grenades; I'd love to hear about them (especially smoke - PODbot often uses them in such a way that I have change my position).

Huh ? What do you mean with that ? ;)

True. But in the case of POD-Bot it would mean I would have to do it manually myself (I'm really lazy and hate waypointing) or other people would do it (where some of them already don't get the existing stuff). So the quality would vary a lot which would have people complain about non-working features etc. you all know the ignorance of some people. I'd love to have something like that done in an automatic way, though I understand that it's very hard and not so perfect as if it's done manually. I often re-read the presentation from Lars Lidden you posted here once which describes a good way to detect choke points (and ambush points) on maps. Do you think it might be possible to combine his method and an already existing rough terrain description (like wayzones + visibility) to come up with an average portal description for area classification ?

I'm surprised you like the smoke gren usage in POD because it's very simple and not very smart.
The POD-Bot version you know does it this way:
- Bot sees enemy
- Bot checks if enemy is facing Bot
- If yes (dotproduct check) cancel smoke gren usage (yes sounds paradox but during the time a smoke gren is thrown the enemy easily could kill the Bot)
- If not Bot tries to throw a grenade on a position halfway the distance to the enemy without caring for obstacles. If distance is below a certain number the Bot tries to drop the gren at his own position.

That's it...if you saw smart behaviour it probably was random :)

I believe Smoke Grens and Flashbangs could only be used in a realistic way if the Bots would really act fully as a team. That is, one Bot spots an enemy and tells his teammember who has a grenade to move to a position where he can throw a grenade at a good position. I would think for smokegrenades this position should be a waypoint on the calculated path to the destination. Flashbangs would be more difficult in that it should be avoided to blind teammates so this should be considered when deciding about a target position. Other than that I myself have a hard time figuring out the when,why and what of using smoke grens and flashbangs since I hardly use them myself...
