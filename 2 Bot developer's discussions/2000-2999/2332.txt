There is nothing in the HPB bot template source code that needs to change.

I don't release the full source code to the HPB bot (mostly because I want YOU to create your own navigation code so that you understand what a challenge it can be).  If you have specific questions about navigation or any of the other functions in the HPB bot code, just ask.  I'll share bits and pieces of other parts of the source code when necessary.  Also there are enough other bots released with full source code that you can look at (BSDbot is one).
