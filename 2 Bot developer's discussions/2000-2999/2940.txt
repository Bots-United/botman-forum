  -How can I get the bots to do a team chat.  You know, only talk to team mates...

  -Also, I'm working on a monster that goes through the level and places waypoints for me.  As opposed to the autowaypoint function, now I don't have to walk through the whole level.  You might think what is the point of having one AI waypoint for another AI - Well, it doesn't matter if the waypointer looks dumb cause he only does his job once.  I have one entity that navigates the level, and another one that shoots six tracelines out to analyze a particular spot.

  -So, what do you all think???

See UTIL_HostSay() in the HPB bot source code.

If you want to have something automatically laying down waypoints, why not have the player and/or bots do this themselves?  I don't see the advantage to creating a separate entity to produce waypoints (since it wouldn't be able to navigate any better than a bot would).

I thought you would say that, but I have the waypointer constantly creating surveyors that shoot out six tracelines( up, down, right, left, front, back ) the waypointer gets the distance values back from the surveyor.  The independant waypointer makes the bot code easier to read and like i said before, it doesnt matter if the waypointer bounces into walls to find which way to go, sorta like bot10, because it only does this once.  Plus, creating a monster sounds like a lot of fun! :)

About this...  How do I get my waypointer to move forward? Just the direction of it's view angles... My waypointer derives from CBaseMonster.

the correspondent direction vector to view_angles can be calculated by UTIL_MakeVectors(view_angles); the result is then at gpGLobals->v_forward

I know that, but how do I get my monster to move in the direction of it's pev->v_angles?  I'm using the testsphere model so it will just float around the level...

u mean this?

code:

Vector v_src = (pEntity->v.origin + pEntity->v.view_ofs)
Vector v_angles = tr.vecEndPos -v_src;

pEntity->v.v_angle = v_angles;
pEntity->v.angles = v_angles;
pEntity->v.angles.x = v_angles.x / 3;
pEntity->v.angles.z = 0;



tr is the Traceline TraceResult you made.

what about the pfnRunPlayerMove () function instead ? I know this to work for fakeclients, maybe it will work on monsters too. Or maybe just forcing their pev->origin to a new value will be sufficient.

Monsters just use pfnWalkMove().
