First of all I just want to remind you that when my bot is released it is not to be taken seriously, its just supposed to add a little comeid touch to TFC and inspire some of you to use your imagination a little more when making bots.


The name of my bot will be the "R3t4rDed B0t". Features my bot will have (a star next to it means I already added it to the bot and a # next to it means I have no idea how the hell to do it but I really want it in the bot)

*The bots can fly! Heh heh!

*The bots cannot swim. They will just sit there underwater and slowly drown to death

The bots walk everywhere like theyre retarded. Like thy walk in zig-zag formations, jump often, and sometimes face the other direction when walking.

*Bots spam on-screen messages constantly just to annoy you

#Medics try to heal you when you're dead! 

#Snipers always aim for the groin instead of the head

#Detpacks will detonate their detpacks in useless locations


As you can see, my bot is truly stupid (hence its name). I would also like to incorporate a personality system but I have yet to figure out how.

Expect the bots to be released as soon as they're at their buggiest potential :)

NOTE: I may change my bot in the future so that the bots act normal but you can select their personality trqit to be retarded. I have yet to figure out if I really want them to fly all the time, it might end up being optional.

To get the sniper to fire lower, just change one of the aiming values (the x value I think) in the bot_combat.cpp function (I think it's called BodyTarget, you can notice it bcoz of a big switch statement that changes lots of x,y and z values according to a bot's skill).

If that doesn't work, change the z value.

I think you could just set the guy that carries the detpack to have a random timer value, :

like pBot->detpack_time = gpGlobals-> +RANDOM_LONG(0, 30)

Then when (pBot->detpack_time < gpGlobals->time), the guy (whatever class he is, I can't remember) plants the detpack. To plant the detpack you probably could do a FakeClientCommand(whatever, "+detpack", NULL, NULL), then when the pack is set, do a FakeClientCommand(whatever, "-detpack", NULL, NULL). I don't know if this will work or not, I'm still experimenting with FakeClientCommand...
