Hi, Im currently knee deep in code for SWAT Bot FR, but I want to add a few cool things but Im not really sure on how since I never learned C++ the normal way (I learnt from HPB Source mainly), this means I can do tracelines and stuff, but now I am looking to do the following:

My idea for my new version is that the AI is modular, with 5 to 6 dlls in use.

1) Main dll - closed source (contains AI think() and so on)
2) Bot Creation/team joining code dll
3) Navigation
4) Combat/weaponry
5) Chat

Each DLL would have key functions that are looked for and so on, and the bot could then have inter-changeable navigation systems

i.e. one swat_nav.dll could be waypointed navigation, the other could be waypointless and so on.

The trouble is I have know idea how I would set the function calls up and load those other dll's.
If anyone has any information that could be of use to be me it would be greatly apreciated.

You will need to combine all messages gained from each DLL into one mutex-locked queue. Then, within StartFrame (~your video fps), DispatchThink (~combination of players' think times), Player Physics start/end, Player think start/end, etc. Why? Because only within these handlers, when called, are guaranteed to not issue a message to the game server while the game server is in the middle of processing another message! That's about all you need. Collect and disperse messages in the StartFrame handler to your DLL client queue, and so on. This way you aren't waiting for another bot (DLL) getting unfair advantages or slowest-bot-lags-everyone problems.

loading that many dlls at a time seems like it would be hard on the users cpu usage eh?

Well no it wouldnt be CPU intensive because of multiple dlls. HL itself already uses about 15 dlls at a time and your PC probably has about 20 of the suckers on call at any time.

What happened to the Birds Bot API thing? Maybe that would suit this style of bot, it sounded pretty modular
