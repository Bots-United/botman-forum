If bot is stuck and i want to add this func's...

Random test to Jump, Duck and Turn around (180 Degs)...

I tryed to add this: in bool BotCantMoveForward( bot_t *pBot, TraceResult *tr )


code:

if (RANDOM_LONG(1, 100) <= 55)
   pEdict->v.button |= IN_JUMP;

if (RANDOM_LONG(1, 100) <= 15)
   pEdict->v.button |= IN_DUCK;

if (RANDOM_LONG(1, 100) <= 30)
   {
       pBot->pEdict->v.ideal_yaw += 180;
   }




But then the bot CANT move in the start... == He dosen't do any thing... Plz help me...

Instead of random events you should use tracelines at the bots head and feet. If the traceline at the head doesn't go very far (i.e. hit a wall right in front of the bot) then it cannot jump, else it can. Same with the other traceline.

You should also try to make the bot 'press' the jump / duck key for more than one frame (and make sure it doesn`t press the other key at the time).
