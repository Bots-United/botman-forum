they're done by scripted sequences (moving around and doing certain animations) and scripted sentences (saying certain things)

scripted_sequence and scripted_sentence are point entities. These are made within the map, it'll be pretty hard to make your won without editing the map, perhaps stripper2 could help.

if you look in http://www.valve-erc.com for some info on these entities, you'll get the hange of it :)
