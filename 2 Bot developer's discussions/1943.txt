From "HPB_bot_waypoint.txt"...

QUOTE:
1. Waypoints, what are they?

Waypoints are locations in the maps that the bots will use when navigating.  They allow the bot to roam about the map without having to blindly bump into walls.  Waypoints can be thought of like the bread crumbs in the Hansel and Gretel story.  They are something marking a path to make it easier to follow.  The waypoints are not displayed while the game is being played.  The bots "know" which way to go by following the path laid out by these waypoints.

In order to get the bots to cover the entire map when playing the game, waypoints should be laid out all over the map.  Without the waypoints the
bots will just randomly run around and will tend to stay in the same area. Waypoints also allow the bot to know where specific goals are in the game. You couldn't play capture the flag unless you knew where the flag was and where the flag needed to be taken after being captured.  Waypoints are what makes all of these things possible.  Bots with sufficiently advanced waypoint information and algorithms would be able to find the shortest distance between points in the map and navigate from their current position to some goal on the other side of the map.

Yeah right. Get your act together :)

It's Tom Thumb who used the crumbs. Hansel and Gretel did the 'stick instead of finger' cheat with the witch to prevent being eaten.

Uhm, hello? I assume you got your knowledge about fairy tales from TV, huh? What do you think why Haensel and Gretel got lost in the woods in the first place? Here is a hint: it got something to do with bread crumbs and birds. Looks like you should spend some time with a children's book again. ;D

QUOTE:
When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: "Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again." When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. 

Hansel said to Gretel: "We shall soon find the way," but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. 



from Grimms fairly tales...

Moral of the story, if you're going to use bread crumbs for waypoints, don't let any birds join the game!  ;D

Thanks for the lesson. My daughter will appreciate it when she's old enough to understand.

I looked up the Tom Thumb fairy tale. Apparently, the Tom Thumb story is from one of the Grimm bros competitors (Perrault).
Tom also uses (white) pebbles rather crumbs:
QUOTE:

Little Tom Thumb let them cry, being confident that they would get back home again. For on the way he had dropped the little white stones which he carried in his pocket all along the path.
