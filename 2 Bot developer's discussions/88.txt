Being the aspiring MOD maker that I am, I have decided that making any MOD would turn out to be a clone of another. So I decided, why not do a spin off of Counter-Strike? The story line you ask? You are an elite group of terrorists bent on world dominance. Based on the map you try to 'break in' to a specific area, or 'break out' of a specific area. The hard part you ask? Getting in and/or out alive. Computer controlled SWAT Teams (bots) are scrambled when you set off an alarm, or forget to disable the security camera systems. It would sort of be live Sven Coop, except based around Counter-Strike. I think this could prove to be a very interesting MOD.
I am looking for your support. Please tell me what you think. If you like it, I will begin development of this MOD immediatly, or if you think I should go to hell, then I'll do that too. Let me know what you think by emailing me (adamc_@hotmail.com) or replying to this post. Thanks.

i dont have any background in making mods so i dont know how hard it is, but if you are willing to put up the effort you are better than i am, just as long as it is not the whopping 70mb that counterstrike is :)i always wanted to play counterstrike, but the size of the download has scared me off!

I am assembling a design/create crew for the MOD. If you are interested please email me (adamc_@hotmail.com) and tell me your 'abilities' and experience.

Does no one care?  I am going to abandon this idea.  No one like it.

I think its a good idea.

I cant help you, as i'm wondering at the moment to either :

1) Create my own mod
2) Translate the quake tf sourcecode to be half-life compatible, and use that to create an open source mod :-)

FYI,

the people who successfully make mods are the ones who have the drive to make a mod against all odds. not the ones who need encouragement with every little step (or even before making a first step).

CS wasn't made for the community. it was made for Gooseman himself. he believed in it no matter how harsh the feedback on the initial version was.
same story for AQ2 (which was really ugly at first), and almost any mod.

This is true.  If you are doing a MOD because you think it will be popular (or because you think you will be able to make money off of it), you are doing it for the WRONG reason.

You should work on a MOD because it's something that YOU enjoy.  It doesn't hurt to get feedback from people about things they like or dislike, but you shouldn't give up on something you think would be fun just because a handful of people think it's a bad idea.

But, before you start a MOD, realize the amount of work that will have to go into it.  Sure, you could take the Standard Half-Life SDK, modify a weapon or two and release that as a MOD.  But no one would want to play it (because it's just like something that's already out there).

Don't assume that you will have 6 or 8 people working on the MOD with you.  Assume that you will have to do the whole thing alone.  You will need to learn to code, make maps, make models, make sprites, make textures, make sound effects and create a web site to promote it all.  It's NOT something you can do in just a month or two.  If you aren't willing to dedicate 6 months to a year on creating a real MOD then it (like so many others) will probably fail soon after it starts.

Well, there is no sense making it if no one likes it.  I was seeing if there was even an interest for this type of mod, and apparently there is not.

After being pressured by all my friends that want to see me do this, I want to 'creep' into this mod making.  I have a compiler, the SDK, and can 'understand' C++.  What is the easiest way for me to jump in head first and figure this out?  Where is a good place to start?  I have the gist of what I need to do, but what do I need to do?  I am confused.  PLEASE HELP.

Read the MOD FAQ...

http://planethalflife.com/botman/MOD_FAQ.shtml

The read through many of the tutorials available on the Internet (links to coding sites are in the MOD FAQ).  Do the tutorials you are interested in to learn about weapons, ammo, menus, etc.

Pick something that you want to try to modify on your own.  Usually it's best to start by modifying something that's already there (like a weapon) until you begin to understand how things in the SDK fit together.  Then, after a few months, you will begin to create things on your own and will be on your way to creating your MOD.

The only thing my source would do is to show you how to make a bot.  It won't teach you how to make a weapon or how to create a new type of ammo.  It won't teach you how to create new game rules or show you how to add a team selection menu.  It won't teach you how to change the graphics on the HUD.  It won't teach you how to create maps, models, textures or sprites.

There are lots of tutorials around the internet that will help you add weapons and make menus,
etc to make your mod (or tc if your that drastic)

I have decided to make my MOD single player with some Multiplayer capabilities. (Don't know how hard that'll be, but I will work on Single player more than Multiplayer.)  I am just going to use HGrunts and Scientists as NPCs instead of bots, and coding AI.  (I'll get to that.......later).  So for now, I think all my issues are settled.  However, I could use a few links to Single-Player mod coding FAQ etc.  Please help! Thanks.

Im making a mod too. You already know that Botman. I started 3 months ago. People said my site sucked, my mod wasent going to make it, and other bad stuff but i didnt listen to them. I wanted to do something that i would be proud of and not other people. People soon asked if they could join, they started sending comments, they wanted to be beta testers, and other stuff! Our mod is pretty popular now! We have had big updates and were getting a new site design. Are mod will be released in about 1 month and a half. Are mod is called "HL:Imperial Battles". It is a star wars mod. And im not intending on ending this mod, So dont try to disscourge me!
