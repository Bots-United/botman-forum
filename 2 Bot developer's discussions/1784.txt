Hi People !

I got a few mails by some Bot Developers how Logo Spraying works in POD 2.0. So instead of e-mailing each & everyone I thought I should share it here in the forum, I believe I did it the same way as Botman's DS Logo Spraying (and will work with every HL Mod even if you as a human can't spray). First and foremost I don't use the impulse command for spraying. When I thought about it, using the impulse command probably wouldn't work on DS Servers + the Bots would always use the Spraypaint Logo you use yourself and I wanted to have some individual ones. So all I did was using & modifying the HL SDK Routine which normally paints Decals (Spraypaints) on Walls. Modify it in that way that it takes the Decalname you supply to it to paint it on BSP Models if the Bot is facing one. A word on the decalnames: of course you can only use decalnames which are present in the WAD File for the MOD you're doing in the case of CS it is 'decals.wad'. Maybe even the ones from the standard HL WAD would work but I don't know exactly about the latter one. Use a Tool like 'Wally' to find out about the names & how they look like.
When you succeeded in writing the actual spraying routine you'll find that the spraying sound isn't played like it would be normally. Simple, just do it yourself in the Decal Paint Routine by adding the needed EMIT_Sound to play the spraycan sample.

I won't give any actual code how to do this because I think it's already simple to do and a little bit of coding yourself can't hurt, right ? ;)
