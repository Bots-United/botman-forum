Is there a way to use (UTIL_TraceLine & UTIL_PointContents) in order for a navigation system?

Like RealBot Navigates,
Also is there a way to fix a bug for when I kick a bot then add a bot he doesn't wanna play?
And the changelevel bug.

Thanx

Look at my Links page on my website for links to sites that discuss bot AI and path finding.

The next release of the HPB bot source code will have a fix for the kick/crash problem in Counter-Strike.
