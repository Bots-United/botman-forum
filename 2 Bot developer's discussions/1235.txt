Hi, anyone happen to get vide to work with borland? I can compile with borland through DOS but I keep having probs getting vide to do it through its gui.I've set up my path properly , and what's very frustrating is I can't seem to even get vide to do a simple hello world example.

Did you try e-mailing the developer(s) of the VIDE application?
