Hey, its me again..the stupid coder :)

im just wondering what entities you added to linkfunc.cpp for ahl to work, because i think im missing some cause ahl wont play the damage sounds and stuff....

btw, do i have to add all weapon id's to get the bot to fire the weapon, right now im using my own botfire function, which isnt more than a random long to make the bots press IN_ATTACK

but my bots just wont fire any gun, they just run around...

and how do i get the button id's so that i can add the bandage and stunt keys( IN_STUNT , IN_BANDAGE)

hope someone can help me out

Hey jorgan,

Did you already see my Flamerbot :P
It does it all (well no stunting, but i'm working on that).

I am also using my own fireweapon function, but did you let them press IN_ATTACK all the time because then they only shoot once and never more. Cause you have to let go off the attack button to shoot another time.

And I am working on the stunts, but I have to get the IN_STUNT bit number.

Hey Ariel, do you have any waypoints for your bot?  Or does it not need them?  I tried using some map I can't remember the name of, and they kept "stunting" off the ledges, it was hillarious, but not quite what I was hoping for ya know?

waypoint for the bot would help it get
around the map (not perfectly though) although
there is no need for waypoints. without waypoints
the bot would just roam randomly.
the stunts are also random, until i rewritr some
of the AI.
