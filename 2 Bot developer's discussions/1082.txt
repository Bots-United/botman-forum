Very new to bot programming, no experience in c++
but took some online tutorials

Can someone teach me (CS)
How bots buy weapons based on current money
e.g. mp5 + kevlar + ammo + HE 

and weapon speeds

and in which cpp file should i place it?

anybody got some better msvc++ tutorials? :)

Okay - use the 'search' function at the top of the page to search for 'buying' or 'weapons'. U can bet that almost EVERY question u want to ask has already been asked by someone else (especially DarkYouth, hehe).

Buying is not as simple as u may think! The first thing that u should do is slow down the bots reaction times though, to make them more fun to fight against. That isn't very simple either if you're a beginner :(

You could always download my TEAMbot source at www.teambot.net - that has a lot of the simple stuff like reaction times, basic navigation, and also the bot buys a few things (like light/heavy armour, and good weapons like the deagle, MP5, Colt, AK-47). You can email me questions about the source at ali@elitegamer.fsnet.co.uk

I recommend that u only use my source as a reference, I think u will be more satisfied with your bot if u know that u made the important parts yourself :)

I have a good 'Teach Yourself C' book that I haven't finished yet, but I've done past File I/O and stuff like that, and I can understand Botman's code fine (apart from some of the waypoint routines).

Try and find someone u know that can program to help you understand the basics (I can ask my dad for help - I'm 17 - if necessary, but basically everyone on the forum has answered all my questions so far) :)

Hey, thanks for replying. I'll expect that good book of yours soon. I think ill go to your site. sounds good. Don't worry, i'll try to learn on my own and use your code as reference :)

Erm, hehe, I'm not giving you my book!! It was about £20, probably the most expensive book I've ever bought! :P

My dad has like £60 books!! He is a professional programmer :)

My site doesn't have any tutorials, but I think my code is pretty simple to understand (and I hope I put enough comments in to explain things).

Please give me some feedback on whether u like the source or not, no-one has really said anything about it yet :(

And I could also do with some feedback on how my site looks - I know it is crap, but I would like to know ho to improve it (colour schemes, pictures etc). U can't really make pictures of a bot, bcoz they look the same as other players!! Hehe :)

oops, sorry about the book. you said you hadn't finished it so i thought you were making it (hehe) Anyway, your code kinda crashes when i compile it. (uh oh) but i can still use it as reference (yeah, cool)

youre lucky youre father is a pro programmer - simply ask questions from him. (wow) maybe you got botman for a father? (hmmm..)

yout site needs a little improvement! i'm not gonna hurt your feelings saying it sucks - but you said it was crap - you said it ; not me. (oops)


kidding aside, are you the guy i used to see in the NNbot forums? are you the moderator with Ditlew? then why don't you ask him for some good code? when is he coming back? Are you the waypointer guy? are you the one included in the bot names when i type addbot in NNbot?  what country do you live? what grade are you in? when did you start programming? what does bool mean in c++? what does extern mean? what does - what?   what then what? what the? what?

- me asks too many questions :(

- oh, and you don't need to answer them all :)

(where are the smilies in this forum?)

Yes I am the same eLiTe from the NNBot forum :) and I could answer your C questions if u want. The reason I don't ask Ditlew for his code is that I'm trying to make MY OWN bot, hehe, that would just be cheating!!

The reason that my source crashes your computer may be that u have not set the right paths (I keep all my HL stuff on my e: drive, not my c: drive like most ppl).

I am having real big problems even getting my code to stop crashing at the moment, and there don't appear to be any problem's with my code (I have only added in very simple things, like my old navigation system, which I KNOW works!) :(

I'm really bored, so here goes :PQUOTE:

Yes :)
QUOTE:

Yes :P
QUOTE:
then why don't you ask him for some good code?


I'm not a cheat :D
QUOTE:
when is he coming back?


He's already back, go to www.planethalflife.com/nnbot , then u can go to the forums and ask Ditlew questions if u want (or u can still use the old nnbot forum)!!
QUOTE:
Are you the waypointer guy?


Yes, but I'm retired from waypointing while I'm making my own bot :)
QUOTE:
are you the one included in the bot names when i type addbot in NNbot?


Yes!! That's cool! So I'm adding in Ditlew to the names of my bots :)
QUOTE:
what country do you live?


Scotland :D
QUOTE:
what grade are you in?


6th Year. That's the last year before University (I'm going to do Computer Science at Aberdeen University, I just got an Unconditional Offer yesterday :) )
QUOTE:
when did you start programming?


Well I did a tiny bit of 'programming' when I was like 4, I just typed programs in out of the Commmodore 64 manual!! Then I started doing proper BASIC programming when I was 12/13 or something. I've been learning C in some of my holidays, but I haven't spent a lot of time on that so far :(
QUOTE:
what does bool mean in c++?


It declares a variable which can either be TRUE or FALSE. It is short for boolean (I always forgot what that was - my dad tried to teach me what a boolean was when I was in primary school but I kept forgetting!!)
QUOTE:
what does extern mean?


It enables u to use a global variable in the current file, even though that variable wasa declared in another file.
QUOTE:
what does - what?   what then what? what the? what?


Yes :D I wouldn't mind if u gave me £999999999. Thanx for offering!!!
QUOTE:
- me asks too many questions :(


Duh.
QUOTE:
- oh, and you don't need to answer them all :)


Too late, hehe
QUOTE:
(where are the smilies in this forum?)


I don't think there are any - I'll just check :) [:)] Well if that didn't work I don't think there are any :(

Smilies :) :D :(,
 That was easy :)!

I've learned BASIC on a TI-82 Calc first & I also used to program on the old Commmodore 64 I knew enough to make several games. (I think I still have them I need to look :( )  Anyway then I went onto Quick Basic from Microsoft, then alittle of ASM (Hard Sh*T!!!) Then C.  Now C++ all this took about (7 years) :)

Started when I was 11
(Dmn! now you know how old I am now!)
(Going to get a degree In Programming in College next year.)

I think my dad had 2 of those calculators u r talking about - one didn't work tho :(

Did they take little memory cards in the back?

He had started to make a morse code program, where the calculator played beeps, and u had to type in the right number, but he'd only got up to e or something, so I finished it off with all the codes! That was kinda fun :)  Although by then the gameboy was out so I was kinda disappointed that I couldn't make a platform game on it! Hehe :D
