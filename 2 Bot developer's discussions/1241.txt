Has anyone else had crashes if you try to add a bot about 10 seconds after the game starts (using botmans second template).  I dont think I have changed anything thing that would of affected this, but it wouldnt supprise me.  I just wanted to ask if anyone else had the same problem before I spend days trying to smash the bug.

Yes do to dll.cpp and search for welcome_msg

A quick fix would be to change the line from something like

welcome_msg = "Whatever"

to 

welcome_msg[120] = "Whatever"

And this will ensure that when something is concatenated onto the end of welcome_msg it will not mess up the computer's memory.
