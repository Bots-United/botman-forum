hello all

i have a segfault problem in my bot. i have tried to check all NULL pointers, memory allocation and overflow problems but i haven't found where it comes from...
do someone know a good way to debug a bot dll ? a software debugger ? an half life engine built in tool ?

thanks for any help

If you are using MSVC, you can use the built in debugger to debug the DLL (build it in Debug mode).  If you aren't using MSVC, I haven't found any debuggers that work properly with the Half-Life executable and DLL files.

There used to be a tutorial on setting up debugging with MSVC on the Wavelength website, but they've removed all the old content.

I was trying to find the old MSVC debugger tutorial on the www.archive.org/wayback machine but it seems to be having some intermitent problems right now.

Ha!  I found a google.com cache of it...

If the MSVC debugger can't help you, then you're up to time and patience ; i.e. comment out the whole Think functions of the bots first, run the game, see if it crashes. Then comment out at a lower level, and see if it crashes again. Then comment out at a lower level, etc.

There might be other ways but I'm not aware of them, that's just how I do the debugging for mine.

I was thinking, has anyone tried to debug a LAN game by using two PCs using remote debugging?

I would really like to debug my LAN only code.
Has anyone trapped the IsDebuggerPresent() call in the client.dll and forced it to always return false?

Hehe Count Floyd was an expert in doing this. He once sent me the modified client.dll but once again it's lost in my mess and I can't get my hands on it no more :(

It's not that difficult in fact, you have to fire up SoftIce and set a breakpoint on IsDebuggerPresent, and change the byte at that offset to change the JNZ in JZ or the contrary, can't remember. But since I do most on my tests on a DS, I guess it doesn't matter to me very much.
