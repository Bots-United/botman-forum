I think you can but you would need like 8 ppl and you should be cafeful not to pass the maximum waypoint limit. But you would have to use autowaypoint on to get it to work.Unfortunatly the bbots will proberbly suck if you try doing it like this. Its better to spend time and make waypoints on your own

You have to consider following questions:
1. How do you organize waypoints and paths internally? Hierarchical system work wonders when using player's movements...
2. Which waypoints get recorded and which don't? You can't record everything because your waypoint-file would get too big, so you need certain criteria to make a decision. You should also be able to delete recorded waypoints when they are not used anymore.
3. Which algorithm do you want to use for pathfinding and when should it make use of newly recorded waypoints and paths?

Strongly disagreed. Did you ever have a look at the Parabot navigation? It works very similar to Jeremy's idea.

Well you could...

 Use could a C++ Class for structured waypoints,
and make the waypoints be created dynamically through memory for each player (That will get rid of max-waypoints).

By theory and some of the code I used inially it wouldn't take up much memory.  I ran a couple of tests and it seemed to work out fine.

Many Quake and Quake II bots use a technique similar to what you describe.  Allowing human players to "drop" waypoints silently while they play is one way of "automatically" waypointing a map.  Of course, if the human player(s) always take common paths there might be areas of the map that never get waypointed due to the fact that nobody ever goes there.  This might not be a problem if there is no real reason to go to those locations anyway.

Use an Internet search engine (like www.google.com) to search for "Quake bot" and you should find several sites that cover this type of topic.
