Hi,

I got yet another question.
I decompiled the .bsp files and created my 
own data-structure in which I store the data I think is relevant for the bot. I got inspired by :
http://csnation.counter-strike.net/cs2d/
in which al 3D maps where reduced to 2D. I did the same thing in my data-structure.

Now I have a new problem -- I want to seperate the map into seperate area's (like rooms, or hallways). I want to do this to let the bot navigate from room to room, like humans do -- however all approaches I have tried to do this failed .. does anyone have an idea how I can program this ?

Another option is to make a graph of all routes which a player can take on the map. With such a graph I can also navigate the bot around the map -- however I also wasn't able to do this either.
Anyone suggestions ?

Did this question make any sense ?
hmmm .. hehehe ...
well -- anyway maybe it's more clear when I show some screen shots -- their on :
http://raidbot.domeintje.net/
then click on 'progress' on the left menu ...

hehehehe...

I do (both the area classification and the navigation graph stuff). 
Have been working on similar things (though on Action Quake2 maps). It's a lot of work.

Send me a mail (Dutch will do - might save you some time) with specific questions and we can discuss these.

Quake II BSP files contains portals information (used to store informataion about portals between areas) in the LUMP_AREAPORTALS section of the BSP data.

To the best of my knowledge, the Half-Life BSP format (derived from Quake I) doesn't contain this portal information.

Perhaps you can use the VIS information to determine which areas are visible from other areas.  This should give you a little bit of information about the connectivity of areas, but you will still probably have to do lots of Tracelines to determine the layout of these areas.
