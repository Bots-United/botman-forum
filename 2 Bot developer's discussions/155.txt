Keep a list of the waypoints recently visited and don't pick a recent waypoint unless no other waypoints exist.

Let's say you want to rembemer the 5 last waypoints.  Create an array of 5 integers (to represent the index of the waypoint) and store the current waypoint index at array[0].  When you reach that waypoint shuffle all the waypoints down 1 position in the array (3->4, 2->3, 1->2, 0->1) and store the new waypoint at array[0].  When searching for the next waypoint skip over anything in the array.  If you don't find one that isn't already in the array, wipe out the array (the memory) and head for the nearest waypoint (don't forget to store the current waypoint in the newly wiped out array first).
