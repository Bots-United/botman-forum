Hi,

I'm making a bot for DoD. And I got them spawned finally. The thing that was causing half-life to crash was the weaponlist in bot_client.cpp:

else if (msg_type == message_WeaponList)
                  botMsgFunction = BotClient_DOD_WeaponList;

So I commented it out and the bots spawn nicely. But now I can't determine the attributes from a weapon, because the weaponlist controls that part. I used the debug_engine to look at the attributes that the mod sends and there are 10 attributes. How can I determine what all attributes are?

And for my second question.
I get these messages when in debug_engine and in the mod DoD:

no pfnmessage: nr. 70 Damage
no pfnmessage: nr. 71 Battery

Something like that. But I got them declared in my bot_client.cpp like so:

else if (msg_type == message_Battery)
                  botMsgFunction = BotClient_DOD_Battery;
               else if (msg_type == message_Damage)
                  botMsgFunction = BotClient_DOD_Damage;

What could be wrong??

Bye
