how would i go about haveing it so when you use an hev station in regular half life ( with the sdk not mm ) a vgui pops up and then you get a weapon that you select.... have the vgui send a "buy 'weaponname'" command????

Is this a bot question or a Half-Life MOD question?  If it's a Half-Life MOD question it should have been in the "Half-Life SDK coding discussion" group.
