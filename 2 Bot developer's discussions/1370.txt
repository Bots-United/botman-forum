I've been fiddling around with my bot during the March break, when I installed CS 1.1 (Retail Patch) yesterday, every time I would load my bot it would freeze up within the first couple mins (sometimes takes a while)

I think the lock-up mostly occurs when a bot is about to shoot me but this morning when I tested it on de_dust, it jumped off the ct spawn (you know how it's a little elevated) and crashed.

I was wondering what's the best way of going around to figureing out what the problem is. Should I comment out code? Which parts?, Should I re-start the code?

My computer has locked up once while playing Unreal Tournament (last Monday) but never locks up while I play CS online (I mostly play in 2 - 4 hours, twice a day this week)

So I would like some help on the above problems and I want to know if anyone elses bots are experiencing the problem I have. Thx

I noticed a problem where the first 3 bots I added to the other team were working fine as far as aiming and shooting go (they were moving too fast though) but the 4th bot would stop moving as soon as it saw me.  It would actually drift to a stop, not freeze immediately.  Also, I couldn't damage or shoot it with guns (ie no blood splatters) but it got hurt by HE grenade and the knife.  

Hope this helps out a bit

The only way you can tackle this problem is using a debugger (hope that you are using MSVC). Botman posted a way how you can debug the new CS-versions using a dedicated server. Try to get that to work.
If you managed this, start a debugging session and wait until the game freezes. Switch to MSVC and interrupt the program. Have a look at the call window: if you are lucky, the game will have frozen in your code and you will get the functions responsible for that. If not, it means that the error ocurred within CS itself - that's where things get really problematic. In that case you'll have to comment out smaller (and successively getting larger) parts of your code and see if that solves the problem.
The first approach is definately better than the trial-and-error method, because testing you can only prove the presence of errors, never their absence...

If your computer is locking up I would definitely suggest uninstalling Half-Life, deleteing the Half-Life folder (and MODs), reinstall Half-Life, patch up to version 1.1.0.6, reinstall CS, then reinstall your bot.

You'd be amazed at how many times this has fixed things for other people who have e-mailed me with this type of problem.
