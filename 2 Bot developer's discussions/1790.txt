Is the origin of an entity in the centre of its bounding-box?

The origin of player models is the center of the bounding box.  The origin of other models (like the scientist, or monsters) is at the feet (i.e. at ground level).  I'm not sure why Valve made one type of model one way and all of the other types of models another way.

Here's another one:

Does UTIL_MakeVectors check whether the argument is an angles vector?  i.e. is it safe to use UTIL_MakeVectors when you're not sure whether you have an angles vector or not but you need an ordinary vector?

Also, does the same apply to UTIL_VecToAngles (i.e. does it check if its argument is an standard vector?)

UTIL_MakeVectors() takes an array of angles as an argument and returns a vector.  You wouldn't need it if you already had a vector.

UTIL_VecToAngles() takes a vector as an argument and converts it to an array of angles.

You need to pick the correct function (from above) based on what you are starting with (array of angles or a vector).
