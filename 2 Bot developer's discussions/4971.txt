Why haven't there been any bots for CS Beta 5.2? Beta 5.2 is still pretty popular and many consider it as the best CS version ever made.

Would it be possible to make a bot using existing code without TOO much effort? 
Does HL versions 1.0.1.0 - 1.0.1.6 even "support" metamods?

lots of posts about this ages ago, the basic reason was that the time when CS beta 5.2, HL couldn't support bots.

No, that's not true.  The reason no bots are available for CS 5.2 is that it requires the old SDK 1.0 source code to get the proper engine header files.  I'm not even sure if you can download the old SDK 1.0 source code from anywhere or not.

If you can find it, you'll also have to spend some time reverse engineering the network messages since these would have changed between CS 5.2 and more recent versions of Counter-Strike.

The Android bot...

...was created around the CS 6.x release (perhaps 6.5, I'm not sure).  The oldest news item talks about CS 7.0

My news from August 27th, 2000, says that the old version of the HPB bot worked with CS 6.5...

For reverse engineering the network data, see the ReadMe.txt file included with my HPB bot template source code.

Good luck.

Hmm... Finding the 1.0 SDK is difficult indeed. I did some searching and the eraliest version I've found so far is the 2.0 SDK... :\

HLSDK 2.0/2.1/2.2 full version include the old source code in HLSDK 1.0.
HLSDK 2.3 deleted it so you can find 2.0/2.1/2.2 full version. Do not download the source only version.

Here is HLSDK 2.0 full version:
