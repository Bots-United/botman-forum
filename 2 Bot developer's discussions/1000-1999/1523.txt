I'm not very happy that POD 2 will shove my bot's face into the mud, but I don't want to be bitter about it: I still want to be helpful!

So I found out how to detect if a weapon is silenced or not: check the pEdict->v.weaponanim field. It will always be 0 when a weapon is silenced (and yes the value DOES change when the weapon is unsilenced). This is only relevant to the USP/TMP/M4A1 so I didn't check the values on other weapons much, but you can try for yourself and see that the value is always 0 when the silencer has been screwed on (there are different values while it is being screwed/unscrewed).

Hope this helps to make POD 2 the best! I am considering just stopping my bot since POD 2 sounds like it is a few months ahead of my bot...

Hi eLITe
I look around and see that most cs bots are more advanced than mine (i started it about 2 months ago, check it out at 
http://www.digitalrice.com/boc)But nevertheless I will still continue coding it, because it's just real fun,and I think you are one of the most enthusiastic coders in this forum (just look at your posts) and so I hope you will continue your project (it's great !).
I hope you all keep your bots what they are:
A hobby, not a race.

During my free time, I'll be coding something that you guys will all eventually use for most Win32 bot mods ;) Muehehe

Yes Red Ghost is right DONT STOP ALISTAIR!!!!!
Just think about your bot not as a bot for people in the world but as an item which you can learn AI with yourself. Like I do :)

DONT STOP!!!!!!

It's really not my intention to make your Bot look bad. Honestly, all this hype & worshipping of Bots (including POD) now seriously gets on my nerves. Like previous posters said (and they are right IMO), I think you should continue working on your Bot, because I assume your doing it for yourself, not for fame & fortune. I started coding my Bot in first place because I finally wanted to have a Bot in CS who's more than just a dummy running around shooting at you and because I got interested in how some of my AI ideas would work out. I don't give a **** about people's oppinions because it can change within seconds without you even knowing why. Also you're offering your source to the whole community which I think is a good thing to have...
About the weaponanim:
Thanks ! However the hearing of shooting sounds still is quite unreliable because we don't really have a way of checking the Audible Set yet. But I'll consider to include silenced affection for 2.0 (hope I'm finished with it this weekend).

Yeah. The silencing thing definitely works I got it working properly today (I was checking the bots weapon instead of the enemies weapon by mistake, lol). It's pretty fun! I defnitely think it would improve POD.

Yeah I started off making my bot for fun, but I like having a little bot community and stuff. I used to be (and still am) one of those bot fanatics I suppose, though I don't think people should hate each other depending on what bot they like! It was sad to see everyone flaming SadBloke just for using RealBot but I think everyone has matured a little since then.

Didn't realise that all those other people would post :D     Don't worry guys I thought about it and if I add in memory to my bots they may still have a chance of being liked by the peeps at NukeBox. Does anyone actually use stuff from the TEAMbot source anyway?

And I can't believe how many posts I have!! I must be spamming really badly!

I have been a member since last year, but I still didn't think I had posted that much!

yeah, keep up the good work...so I can keep stealing snipets from your bot =P

hehe, j/k  I just look at how you did it, then make sure that everything I do is better.  (I wish)

Im looking at movement while shooting... anyone have an idea on this?

i.e. some rusher bots will carry on rushing towards an objective running backwards while shooting.

I cant work out the ratio of direction to target to strafing speed for compensating. Maths is the work of seven devils with long rods.

I think Tobias put up an equation for this - try searching for 'sin', 'cos' or 'tan'. I think it included 'sin' but I can' remember. I thought putting in trig would slow down the bots a lot, but that's just me learning bad habits from BASIC or something :)

Not me... Somebody did put up an equation for that, what I posted was that you actually don't need any equations: You can just pass different move- and viewangles to runPlayerMove and it works fine.

Well my bots DO look about but only forward, back, left and right, they can't do anything in between, it's too complex without some sort of equation. It works OK, but more precise looking about would improve things a little (although it may not be realistic, as humans won't move like that, they will make little strafing adjustments, etc, to move at an angle other than 0,90,180,270)

The answer is just a little vector math.  The difference between two vectors is a new vector that represents the vector between the two endpoints.
And you needn't do any of the under the hood math, since its all there already.
so we need two vectors, which are your origin and your enemy's origin, and their difference is the vector that connects the two of you, so then convert it to an angle with something like...
view angle = VecToAngle(pBot->v.origin - Enemy->v.origin)

and your move angle would be an angle made from the vector between you and your current goalpoint... 
VecToAngle(pBot->v.origin - pGoal->origin)

that should be how to get the values you need, unless i am using the wrong function name where i used VectoAngle, but im not near a computer to check so i dont know...

Nearly right, but you'll have to switch the vectors you use as origins, i.e. (Enemy->v.origin - pBot->v.origin) for the view and the move accordingly, otherwise your bot will look/move directly in the opposite direction you intended it.

Yes I can already do that for things like making my bot looking in a direction when it is camping (or even just looking towards a waypoint!), but it is unrealistic to get the bot to move at any angle it wants to. To be human it would have to do little strafe adjustments which I mentioned earlier. Probably wouldn't be too hard but I don't want to make my bots know the EXACT location of enemies just by hearing them at the moment!
