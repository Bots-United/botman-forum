Entity association!

Im now coding my bot so if its current waypoint is on a lift which has a universal "special" flag the bot will do this (example used is cs_siege elevator, ct entrance, standing looking at the lift)

1) Check the waypoint is reachable (to see if its not blocked or the entity is not there)

2) If not blocked, then check the associated entity (flagged when waypoint added automatically)

3) Find the entity's nearest trigger

4) If that entity is a multi-manager, find the nearest MAIN trigger of the multi-manager

5) Activate THAT

6) Wait until waypoint is reachable (if not after 15 seconds, abort)

7) Move on.

8) If not moving, then find the nearest main trigger, hit it and move back.

9) Wait.

10) If still not moving forget using the lift and walk like everyone else.

Ive had moderate success using this, but the waypointing system is becoming a little complex I think :(

On the other hand, no-one waypoints for swat besides me and its not much to spend 15 minutes per map placing points and 20 more testing them.

Is anyone else toying with code like this?

I did something similar by trying to get the trigger button for doors/elevators etc.
The problem is that the nearest Button to the Bot isn't necessary the reachable one and it's a bad idea to check with tracelines if it's actually seen by the Bot (mostly it's not). I'm trying to do it another way but it will take some time to try it out (remember the 'connectionflags' in the chat?).

I am tracking the players and store the buttons they press to use lifts or open doors or whatsoever. For lifts or platforms I store the current positions these entities have when the players "get onboard". Before the bots do the same (after pressing the button) they wait until the platform is near that stored position. Quite easy implementation and works nearly 100%.

Hey you ripped off my 'secret' idea ;)
PPL try out ParaBot, it definitely works almost perfect !

In my case:

The bot uses a cost function to determine nearness, (its a simple +1 count for each waypoint) of each button.

All you'd have to do really for each lift is put one waypoint at each exit and one on the lift at each stop. Then the rest is code :)
