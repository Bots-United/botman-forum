Give me a little more details in what have gotten accomplished etc on independent client code.  While this is a great way to make bots, i see a couple problems.  You will have to rewrite about 50% prehaps more of the code valve had to write to make the engine, while you wont have to make the 3d engine, you will have to handle entities/netcode/physics/prediction/map processing/crc's.  I sorry to admit that i have not the patience to even try to rewrite all this code, even for the sake of a bot.  I think you will find it hard pressed to be able to do everything that valve does, just running the crc's on the files for server validation will hang you by the balls i imagine.  Im sorry, but i dont feel working on such a project is at all worth it.  As for my solution, it is not perfect either, it relies on the slow halflife engine.  it is limited to what the engine allows the client to do and other things.  Turning res all the way down, disabling all eyecandy, turning vsync off, using a decent videocard/processer, you can speed up how fast it the but runs, and prolly be able to get significant processing power left over for advanced bot stuff.  Well good luck on your client project.  Btw what is cstv?

You can just use the Quake Source and start from there :D

According to yahn, Half-life was made from the Quake 1 source (not quakeworld)

wouldnt make much difference, valve changed like 70% of the code they got from id. sure alot will will be similar, but cut n paste would hardly work.

we are fully aware of this, and we will try to handle it..at least try...

cstv is like quaketv but for cs, we let cstv connect to a cs server and spectate...and then cstv lets other clients connect to it so they are able to spectate the game through it...

this isnt a good explanation, but its short and includes the basics...goto the quaketv homepage for more details...

HL was made from Quake but the netcode is(or was) very similar to Quakeworld

hmmm ...first of all thx :)

i don't know how much you know about netcode and stuff. 
valve made some major mistakes when developing the netcode, first of all they have a lot of debugging functions for the netcode, which help a lot in understanding it. they added a simple realtime XOR-encryption, which isn't really a big task. (actually they added multiple encryption functions, but they are all the same with different XOR values and LUT's). you don't need to render any 3d (althought its no big task to get a simple level render for debugging.)

handling entities isn't a big task neither.

halflife actually has no "physics", it's completely fake and very  very basic. all map processing you need is reading the brushes, vis table and BSP tree, to get a faster Collision detection.

prediction is part of the bot code.
this is the basic idea with the own client, you can design every single aspect of the bot as you want. and you don't have to use valves sometimes crapy prediction code. i think a bot doesn't even need prediction code as halflife offers, bots need a completely different prediction.

pikachu's idea is pretty good, cuz winquakes (and quake2's)netcode is very very similiar to hl. it uses the same sequencing system, and except the encryption and prediction it's very similiar.



cstv is a similiar thing to what valve is about to release (spectator client) so i think that could be screwed :)

The prediction im talking about is handling of entities between updates. If you are getting updates from server every 500ms, thats half as second worth of frames you will have to predict where entities will be.  Though it doesnt have a true physics engine, it does have a halfassed one.  Well it all adds up.  I will reconsider once the semester is over.  I would very much like to get rid of the valve engine though, the client interface is inherently evil.

you are right, but i think the preditcion code should be part of the bot. well that should be investigated :)

for the physics, it's so extremly simple cuz every single entity is handled like a particle (except some fake rigid body computations) i guess u think of the collision detection, which is pretty difficult, but perhaps there would be a better solution than valves bsp tree. maybe an octree implementation would help here
