i was wondering how the flashbangs are called on the client-side...  just to add onto the bot along with the smoke-grenade (almost working) removal system :)

you could mess about with either....

pBot->pEdict->v. -........

renderamt
rendercolor
renderfx
effects

basically flashbangs are fades that appear on the screen, I think what some flashbang removal systems do is they make the "fade" or white box (that normally covers the whole screen) makes it smaller and/or moves it off the screen

If you look in the HPB bot template source code in the bot_client.cpp file there is a BotClient_Valve_ScreenFade() function that is used when a screen fade network message is sent to a client.  All the bot_client function does is set a variable called "blinded_time" which should be close to the amount of time that a player would be blinded and shouldn't be able to see any enemies.
