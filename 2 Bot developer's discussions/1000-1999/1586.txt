Hi..
I was thinking of making waypoints to camp, but then realized it would be not so useful if the bots just hang around there.

Camp waypoints should have a direction where the bots can look at that direction only. This will at least make the bot knows where to expect enemy coming. Anyone knows how to do this?

It's already in the HPB bot template code.  Look at how the aiming waypoint is handled.  The aiming waypoint is basically and additional waypoint added when you create a sniper waypoint.  This tells the bot which direction to face when sniping.  You can subtract the origin of the aiming waypoint from the sniper waypoint to determine the direction that the bot should face.

what i do, since i dont use waypoints on my bot like all other bot authors do. I just trace a few lines and the farest distance will be the 'best way to look at'.. randomly recall that function. And make the bot move left/right with a random amount in a random amount of time too to make a bot 'wonder' where enemies could be...
