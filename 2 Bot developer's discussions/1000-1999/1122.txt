Can anyone hlp me with compiling the sdk with the borland Bcc55? i downloaded the source-only full sdk version, and the borland_sdk.zip from this page. I THINK I set up the compiler right, and I followed the description in the borland_sdk.zip file. But when I try to compile, I get a long list of errors, all of them because the compiler can't find the standard include files, such as <stdio.h>, <math.h>. Plz hlp me fast. I cant get it work.

It sounds like you didn't edit the BCC32.CFG and ILINK32.CFG files in the SourceCode\dlls folder.  Go back and read that section (found just before "Running the Borland compiler:").
