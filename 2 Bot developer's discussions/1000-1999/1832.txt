if anyone can spot any errors like vgui menu id's or something can u correct the lines what are wrong, the bot only seems to join a team then does nothing at class select.

hi noodles,

i dont have any experience with firearms-bot-programming but had an similiar, very irritating problem with a cstrike-bot:
they also only joined the team, and neved choosed a class.
my bot never received a message about the class-(model-selection)menu, everything was allright, but the %§(&/-message wasnt send!
after trying and trying a lot, i discovered, that i have to send g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove (to say explicitly that i'm *not* moving!?) to receive the message!?!? after that, everything went fine, that was all - but without this null-playermove, the message never came....

so - after checking if the msg-id for team-join-menu itself is correct (by debug-output-txt) i would perhaps try to include g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove in the bots-think function so that it is called every frame during the phase between joining a team and selecting a class (if it isnt allready - then the whole long long post is useless... sniff.. ;-) 


bye, mark

I don't need to try it, because it has no fucking relevence to me. As i said before "yes your post was totally useless", don't make me say it again.

BOOL you_are_asshole

int main()
{
 you_are_asshole = TRUE;
 if (you_are_asshole == TRUE)
  {
   stop_being_such_a_dick(please, thank_you)
  }
 return 0;

I post this to 3 forums, i get 3 different dumb shits responding to my posts, i sortta get pissed off. 

1st response on a diff forum: try typing addbot you dumb fuck
2nd response on a diff forum to that one: sif u made that code, u rippped it from botman's hpb code 100% stolen
3rd response on this forum: some dumb bitch who says something about getting the bot to move when bot ain't even in the game yet, then being pedantic and saying "grrr did u try it"

Just a question, Botman: Is it possible to ban users from this forum?

It's possible to ban someone by IP domain, but I haven't had to do that in a LONG time.

hehe Noodle's attitude isnt unique around the Half-Life "Player"s comminuty, I'm sure clan (1) would be interested in him.

I do have a question that he may be able to answer tho (if typing with those hooves is easy enough)

Is a players team in firearms recorded in the pev->team or would I have to check the model fo the player like botman does for CS?

now i see why you see don't my reason of getting pissed off, mark what's his name, modified his post to something totally different that he first said after i had posted he doesn't know what he's on about

ok noodles-boy, i think, i need to write some words to you to make some things clear. 

- first of all i want to thank you for your really amusing show here in the forum! how old are you? i guess at around ... uhm.. (i'm allways been bad i guessing someones age..) 
..dont know exactly, but my little brother (12) is in the same period as you are: complaining a lot, sreaming and shouting around. (that makes you feel to be a REAL man, ha?)
take comfort - in some years it will be over...

- then i only want to say, i never modified my post "to something totally different" - it's still the same post as on the very first day, i didnt modify one word...

- .. but perhaps you see now, that it is not soooo without relevance: this described "bug" (or whatever it is) exists in CS. even when i'm not in a team, only connected, when i remove the g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove(0,0...) function, i never get the message. thats a fact (sorry). 
and it was worth for my to give it a try and type some sentences for you. after your short answer, i then only wanted to know, if you tried it - thats a problem for you? i mean, you send a bunch of source we have to read for your problem - thats ok - but then, don't begin to cry when someone wants to have an answer from YOU.. i hope this small "grrrr.." (really bad, bad word, i know!) didnt make you explode so...

- ..so: enjoy your day (and your surely growing gastric ulcer), join a fitting clan as proposed (is there a [WeAreBest-RestRFu**ingPissOffPpl]-Clan? i think, that would be the right for you, sweetie! >:->) and perhaps write down some whine.txt or shout.txt for bot-chat-messages - you seem to have a talent for it...

bye

i think your problem is in the skill selection

use "setskill" and NOT vguimenuoption for
skill selection...

I used this code (I was actually pretty damn close to having the same code) my bot doesnt join a team. Im using the preconfigs instead of this and this bot is for 2.5... outdated
