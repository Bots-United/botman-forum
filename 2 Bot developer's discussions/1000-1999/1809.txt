Has someone got code to make bots attack monsters?
If not, can someone run me through the bot ai schemes (I'm an HPB newbie)

I've never seen any web sites with tutorials on the AI contained in Half-Life.  You're on your own there.

You could modify the BotFindEnemy() function to search for "monster_" type enemies instead of other players to get them to attack monsters.

That is quite a good idea, to have bots as coop players in the single player game. :P
