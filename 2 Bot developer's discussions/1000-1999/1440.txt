Why after removing HPB_BOT v.10 from OPFOR or from VALVe (in my case) OpFor crashes after loading any map?

Did you change the liblist.gam to load the original OpFor-DLL (not hpb.dll) again?

You should use the "Remove" program in the HPB_bot MOD folder to remove the HPB bot.  It will restore the original liblist.gam file (that gets renamed to old_liblist.gam).

If you still have an "old_liblist.gam" file in the Half-Life\gearbox folder, just delete the liblist.gam file there and rename "old_liblist.gam" to "liblist.gam" and things should go back to normal.

There shouldn't be any other files (other than liblist.gam) that would affect the original MOD.  It may just be a conincidence that this happened after removing the bot.  The simplest thing to do is to uninstall the OpFor add-on then reinstall it.  I think OpFor has an uninstall thing in the Control Panel Add/Remove programs.
