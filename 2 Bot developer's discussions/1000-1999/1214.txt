Is it just my bot, or do all these bots make mp_tkpunish not work properly?

For me, mp_tkpunish doesn't do anything when I'm running my bots.  If this is just my bot, any idea why?

My best guess is that Fakeclients (Bots) aren't checked for teamkills. I could be wrong though.

Well that maybe so...but no-one is getting checked, not even human players
