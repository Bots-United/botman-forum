Hey all, i was wondering. How do you create a new folder? i know how to create new files, load files and so on. But i'd like to create a new folder. Any tips?

Isn't a folder just a file with the directory-attribute set?

Look at the C function mkdir().

botman, i have msdn installed and read the stuff about mkdir, i just wondered how to apply that. Like with files? I must admit, that file handling is my weakest part in C++.

That's mainly because directories have never been part of standard C and C++ libraries (unlike files - there are too many variations of directories in the OS's in use; even OS's without directories).

Here's the prototype...

int mkdir(const char *);

You would use it like this...
code:

if (mkdir("C:\\SIERRA\\Half-Life\\valve\\my_dir") == -1)
{
   printf("Error creating directory!\n");
   exit();
}

...don't forget to use 2 backslashes instead of a single backslash since the first backslash will be the "escape" for the second one.

thx botman. One thing though, do we use different msdn packs? or am i just blind and looked for the wrong Mkdir function? there are 5 different ones in my msdn help file...

I'm just grepping the .h files in the vc98\include directory.  The grep shows this...
code:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include>grep mkdir *.h
File DIRECT.H:
_CRTIMP int __cdecl _mkdir(const char *);
_CRTIMP int __cdecl _wmkdir(const wchar_t *);
_CRTIMP int __cdecl mkdir(const char *);
File TCHAR.H:
#define _tmkdir     _wmkdir
#define _tmkdir     _mkdir
File WCHAR.H:
_CRTIMP int __cdecl _wmkdir(const wchar_t *);

...I seledom use the MSDN Library if I can find what I'm looking for in a much faster way (it take about 10 or 15 seconds to start up MSDN then it take it 20 to 30 seconds to find the matches, then it take me another minute or so to find the one I'm looking for and then another 10 or 20 seconds for MSDN to bring up the topic.)

I can type "grep mkdir *.h" and get the results in about 10 seconds.
