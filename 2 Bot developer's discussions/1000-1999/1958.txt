Please can u help me with this. Im making a mod and it has a basic experience system that is emplemented. that when you kill someone you get an experience point and if you die u lose one.
Please tell me if this is right:
IN MULTIPLAYERGAMERULES.CPP
in Playerkilled

pVictim->m_fExperience = pVictim->m_fExperience--;// subtract 1 experience point from dead player
peKiller->m_fExperience = peKiller-m_fExperience++;// add 1 experince to the killer

Then in the playerspawn

if ( pPlayer->m_fExperience < 4 )//if expience less than 4 give these
      {
            pPlayer->GiveNamedItem( "weapon_crowbar" );
            pPlayer->GiveNamedItem( "weapon_9mmhandgun" );
            pPlayer->GiveAmmo( 68, "9mm", _9MM_MAX_CARRY );// 4 full reloads
            pPlayer->GiveNamedItem( "item_parachute" );
            pPlayer->GiveAmmo( 68, "Hand Grenade", HANDGRENADE_MAX_CARRY );// 4 full reloads
            pPlayer->GiveNamedItem( "weapon_handgrenade" );
      }
      if ( pPlayer->m_fExperience >= 4 )// if experince more than 4 give this 2
      {
            pPlayer->GiveNamedItem( "weapon_flashbang" );
      }
Is this right please help

This will ONLY give the flashbang to players with experience >= 4.  I doubt that's what you wanted.

Take out the first "if" in your playerspawn code (to give everybody that stuff regardless of experience) and leave the second "if" statement in there (to give experienced players some extra stuff).

ANd change these lines

pVictim->m_fExperience = pVictim->m_fExperience--;// subtract 1 experience point from dead player
  peKiller->m_fExperience = peKiller-m_fExperience++;// add 1 experince to the killer

to

pVictim->m_fExperience--;// subtract 1 experience point from dead player
peKiller-m_fExperience++;// add 1 experince to the killer

The code you had is not dependend on the compiler and may give you funny results.
