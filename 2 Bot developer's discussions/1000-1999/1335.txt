Im coding bot10 into my mod, and Im struggling to find a way to make it so that if they sense an info_flash or they see the flashbang model on the ground, they will have their FOV limited to practically nothing for a couple seconds. Is this possible?

Please help me with this, I cant really figure out how to accomplish this.

Search for the word 'screenfade' in the template 2/3 source and you will find the correct procedure for making the bots react to the screen flashing...

Since you are adding the bot into your MOD, you can do things a little differently than the HPB bot does.

When a flash grenade is thrown, loop through all the bots and check if any bots have the grenade in their field of view and if the grenade is visible (not behind a wall).  For each bot, set a time in the future when the bot will be able to "see" again.  Also if the bots currently have an enemy you may want to clear that out since they won't be able to "see" the enemy anymore.

Until this time is reached, don't allow the bots to search for enemies or other items in the level.  You could make the bots stand in the same place during this time, or have them randomly run forward, backward, or left or right.
