I plant to code an irc client for halflife counterstrike...
It is possible to write the client anywhere 
in the mp.dll and replace it in the cs dlls??
I think that have to work?
Or will cs crash if i do so (with the standart 
or full sdk)???

The way botmans bot works is my replacing the mp.dll (cstrike), but not overwriting it.
Just comment it out in the liblist.gam

//gamedll "dlls\mp.dll"
gamedll "dlls\mydll.dll"

You could take botmans template2 and remove all the bot code, and put in your irc code. Using this method would make it compatable with most mods (and if you code for it, all mods). 

Not exaclty sure where to put it in the template2 code.
Youd probably have to create 1 fakeclient which was the irc code, duno.

Oh, carful not to bog down the game (i.e. have 1 huge irc function) as this would be pointless :)

Hope this helps

the bot dll is placed between the HL core and the mp.dll The botman stuff just links a lot of functions (THX botman, that u wrote this shit once for all) through this bot dll, but gets informatíon from this calls, too. for the HL core it looks as if there is this old mp.dll, nothing else ( and vice versa for mp.dll ...)
