what does ->v.absmin ->v.absmin ->v.origin etc. exactly represent ?

For the entvars_t structure, "absmin" an "absmax" represent the absolute minimum and absolute maximum 3D coordinate of an entity.  For example is the ladder is 80 units high and 40 units wide and 10 units deep, if the absmin is (100, 40, 70) then the absmax would be (140, 50, 150), assuming the depth is along the Y axis.

The origin is the center of the entity.  This is usually the average of the absmax and absmin value (add them together and divide by 2).  For the above example, the origin would be (120, 45, 110).

although i forgot 'for ladder entities' (how did u knew that i forgot that ?! ) .... . I looked at the coordinates of a ladder and they were just a bit strange ... Thx

Hi,

This is not true for func_doors. The absmin and absmax represent the area in which the door can move. If the mapper has used a door as a lift, the center will be half-way up the lift shaft.

Regarding v.origin: As botman said, it's only usually the center - many functional entities (e.g. healthchargers) just store (0,0,0) as their origin. To be sure to get the right position you've got to calculate the center yourself by using the absmin and absmax values.

func_doors: absmin and absmax do NOT "represent the area in which the door can move" but the current position of the door (or lift). The center will only be half-way up the lift shaft if the lift is currently in its upper position, if it's down, the center will be hidden in the ground (since the shaft belongs to the lift as well).

I thought the VecBModelOrigin just does this for func type entities ?

Hi,

Are you sure about this Tobias? I was investigating this for the use of lifts. The func_door lifts in 2fort would give me the same absmin and absmax whether they were up or down. Or maybe I'm not remembering right?

Yes, I'm sure. That's the way things work in HL deathmatch and I don't see any reason why they should have changed that for TFC.

Brendan,

Tobias' description is consistent with the Quake 2 engine as well. Origins typically are used to specify a reference point for a brush to move along or rotate about. 
Most nil origins are simply nil because the level editor has no need to set any reference point for the brush. 

In case of your 2fort, are you sure there aren't any slave entities involved that do the actual movement? These would have an absmin and absmax that do change.
