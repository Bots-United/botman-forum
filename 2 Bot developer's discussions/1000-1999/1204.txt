Ok, i heard i think Elite talk about writing a function to get certain ids for a mod, but putting in a function in your bot code. Does anyone know where to put it, which section?
And if you are at what would be best way to get a bot to choose teams. Right now my bot just sits unassigned.


Thanks,
Dustin

Change "debug_engine = 0;" to "debug_engine = 1;" in the engine.cpp file.  Build the bot and start a game.  This will print out client messages into a file called "bot.txt" in the Half-Life directory.  You can edit this file to see messages that are sent to a client.

The bot joins a game by looking for some of these network messages (see the bot_client.cpp file for examples of these).  The BotStartGame() function in bot_start.cpp is responsible for sending the appropriate commands at the necessary times to get a bot to join a game.  Look at how the functions for TFC, CS and FLF are using in the bot_client.cpp and bot_start.cpp files.

mod_id is a global, I was just saying that to make your bot compatible with another mod, u would have to add in most of the mod specific stuff at the places where you check mod_id

But I don't know how to find out about the new entities u will have to add in, although I think there are other topics that tell u how to do this...

Read this thread about a utility I wrote to dump the exported symbols from a DLL file...

Botman, thanks for that extract.exe program. It helped tramendously. I think my problem is down to the MOTD VGUI screen. How can I bypass this? or is there a clientcommand to hit enter or esc. Or how could I get rid of it.

Thanks,
Dustin

You can try getting the bots to randomly press the fire button (like they do when they are dead and trying to respawn).  You should also just be able to delete the motd.txt file to prevent it from showing up.

The HPB bot doesn't have this problem with TFC, CS or FLF if motd.txt files exist, so I don't think the motd file is really your problem.
