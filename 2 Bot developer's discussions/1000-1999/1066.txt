This is a two parter...
# 1 How can I get a listing of all the variables that are available about an entity or client, (eg name, wonid, team, etc etc)?  Are they in the edict_s structure?  If so, which are which?  There doesn't seem to be enough information there to hold all the info about the clients.  I'm sure I'm missing something somewhere.  I searched for where edict_t is defined, and I think it was just a clone of edict_s.
# 2 If I wanted to put all the clients in an index array (i'm assuming it would have to be an array defined like this edict_t my_array_of_clients[32], right?)  then what function could i call or how would i do this:
loopy loop stuff with count as the index,   my_array_of_clients[1] = clientinfo(count), etc etc till i have them all indexed and stored. is there a function like clientinfo that I could send the index number to?  hehe, which brings to the next thought of what variable shows the total of clients in the game so I know where to stop my loop?  whew!
TIA

Template 2 has a global num_bots variable telling u how many bots are in the game.

Search for the StartFrame function (in dll.cpp), that stores some stuff in a client array like you are talking about (I think). I think that also keeps a record of how many players there are. Otherwise you could loop through all the pBot structure and see if (pBot->is_used == TRUE), or something similar...

ok i'll look there, but i'm not talking about "just" the bots, I want to get the info for everyone, including variables containing the wonid, player # (like shown when doing a "users" in the console) etc.  so just the pBot structure alone won't help.  TIA

To #1: A big part of the client variables are indeed in edict_s. However, since every client is a player as well, there are a bunch of additional CBasePlayer-class-variables. Maybe these are the ones you are looking for. You can get a pointer to a CBasePlayer-Object using the GET_PRIVATE() macro. Don't forget to include the CBasePlayer declaration in your project. If you are looking for information not defined there nor in edict_s you'll have to hook the engine-functions where the values you want are modified or set.
To #2: I think botman has got a getPlayerByIndex-function or something like that. You don't have to store the edicts to access client data: just use this function. I think there is an example in the HPB-template for this...
