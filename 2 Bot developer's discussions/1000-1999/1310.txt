Well actually no hud at all.
Im making just a little weapon mod for fun and will be adding bots later.
But ive created a custom mp.dll
ive placed this in ...half-life\mymod\dlls
i took the client dll from normal half life and placed it in mymod\cl_dlls.
But there is still no hud but the game runs fine and i can pickup weapons (cant change though)
Pleeze help

Are you attempting it in singleplayer because there isnt singleplayer support in the mp.dll.

Is item_suit one of the items you spawn with? Check multiplay_gamerules.cpp to check.

And last but not least, maybe you dont need to take the cldll from the Half-Life directory. You can just leave the old one in the Half-Life directory and it will still run the cldll from that directory.

Hope I helped.
