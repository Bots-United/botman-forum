I've got my bots to stop crashing, and even though they're basically the same as Alpha 1, theyt're now on Template 2 instead of Template 1!!

So any ppl who liked my source for template 1, go to www.teambot.net and get the latest stuff. What it has over Botman's basic template:

Custom waypoint system (not great, but I've got a system planned out to make it easier to use/understand)

Reaction times - a bot can react to u pretty quickly, but will take a little longer to shoot (so that it can face u when u shoot it, but won't fire for a little longer).

Improved NewRound detection code... not sure if it is working perfectly, but it seems to be fine

Bots buy armour and some weapons

If u r having problems with simple things like these, then u can use my source to help u out (as long as u mention where u got the source from in your readmes), and u may be able to improve some of these things, but I have tried to make my implementation of these features simple to understand (I think), just email me at ali@elitegamer.fsnet.co.uk if u have any problems.

PS - I keep my source code on my D: drive now, so you MAY have to change some path settings to get the source to compile properly... if u can't do this, then u probably shouldn't even ATTEMPT to make a bot, hehe :)

There is one problem, if u try to add in bots too quickly then it may crash, but I think this is a 'Botman bug', not my fault - if u use the bot.cfg I supply in the install file on my website, then it will add in up to 31 bots without crashing (as it waits 3 seconds b4 adding in each bot). This MAY only be a problem on fast machines, email me if u have any problems, or if u know how to solve this bug??

Adding bots too quickly causing a crash is a Half-Life engine bug, not a bot code bug.

Here's how to reproduce the problem (unless you have a blazingly fast CPU)...

1. Pull down the console and bind a key to "addbot" like this...

bind x "addbot"

2. Return to the game by toggling the console back up.

3. Press the 'x' key as fast as you can.  The Half-Life engine will crash.

Yes, that's what I usually do, ever since I got NNBot - I've not had problems with other people's bot's crashing, but I suppose I never tried using my new PC with other peoples bots (the P500 is always the server).

The PC that crashes is a 1GHz Athlon, so that will be the problem - it's too fast for it's own good!! Thankyou for clearing that up once again Botman :)

Funny thing is, when you add bots using BotCreate function in ONE frame, then you can add 10 bots in one frame without a problem.

Hehe, maybe I should make a new command - add31bots, so that I can add them all at once without any crashes!!

It crashes because in a real network game all the players will not be connecting at the same time, so the ppl at valve must have just thought that they would have at least 3 seconds b4 another player joined, and coded the join-code appropriately or something... not very safe!!

The only disadvantage is, the bots will ALL join the same team, since at that specific frame the engine will always 'auto-join' them to the same team...
