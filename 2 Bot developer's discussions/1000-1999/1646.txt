I you are just trying to create waypoints in a map (like a normal user would), you can read the HPB_bot_waypoint.txt file that is included in the HPB bot executable download.  It explains how to add/remove waypoints in a level and gives some tips on where to place waypoints.

If you are trying to create your own types of waypoints you should look at the waypoint.h and waypoint.cpp file included with the HPB bot template source code.  The waypoint menus are all handled in the dll.cpp file (including the code to turn on or off the tags on the waypoints).

All of the waypoint functions in waypoint.cpp work but there isn't anything in the navigation code to use those functions.  You have to decide how your bot wants to use the waypoint functions for navigation.  Some of the waypoint functions you might want to use are...

WaypointFindNearest();
WaypointFindNearestGoal();
WaypointFindRandomGoal();
WaypointFindReachable();
WaypointFindPath();

...and for the shortest route navigation...

WaypointRouteFromTo();
