I would like to be able to capture the thrower of a smokegrenade. Is there a property of the grenade i can check that would point to the thrower, or will i have to monitor throws? Whats the easiest way?

I would just intercept the entity being created.  Look at the very end of the ReadMe.txt file that comes with the HPB bot template source code for an example of doing this.

ok thanks, i guess thats the only way to do it. I was hoping there was some variable or somehting, mainly becasue it credits HE kills and i would think they would make it easier on themselves by making the grenade cary a thrower tag... and then when making smoke grenades just not remove this tag.

Smoke grenades won't kill anybody (thus there's no credit for a kill).  Why would they need to keep the owner of a smoke grenade?

I got killed by a smoke grenade once. funny as hell. I was running down under the bridge in dust ( i only had 9 health ) then all of a sudden boom. and i died and the thing landed in front of my corpes and was smoking
