The only files u will really need to edit at first are in the dll folder... look in bot.cpp first, that is where most of the other functions are called (but I think the first function that is called is in dll.cpp/engine.cpp, it is called StartFrame, and that is where bots are joined, and the bot.cfg file is read).

I think the only other file I have edited out of this folder is waypoint.h, but since I use MSVC++ I don't need to navigate through all the folders, I just have a list of all the needed external files in one window :)  Much more convenient to have all the files listed for u and ucan just double click on the one u want to edit!!
