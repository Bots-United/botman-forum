Using tripmines is a bit tricky because you will have to teach the bots where to plant them. You could define special waypoints where to plant tripmines (easiest solution) or maybe you'll think of another idea... If you have any specific questions, jusk ask.

I tried using BotCheckWallOnLeft and BotCheckWallOnRight and if the bot is holding a tripmine it will turn either left or right (depending on where the wall is) and it whil plant it! 

I tried it but I havent seen them do anything yet hehe... I'm gonna try to do it that way as well cos I want them to plant tripmines too!

you could try this


botcombat.cpp

call it like this... somewhere in bot_combat.cpp
code:


if (iId == VALVE_WEAPON_TRIPMINE)
 BotDeployTripmine(pBot);




code:


void BotDeployTripmine ( bot_t *pBot )
{

  edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;

  if( (BotCheckWallOnLeft)  (BotCheckWallOnRight) )       // Check if there is a wall on the left or right
  {    
      if(BotCheckWallOnLeft)
        pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = pEdict->v.ideal_yaw - 90; // Turn left 90 degrees
      else                                     // Wall must be to the right...
        pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = pEdict->v.ideal_yaw + 90; // Turn right 90 degrees
      BotFixIdealYaw(pEdict);

      pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK;                   // Deploy tripmine

      return;
  }
  else
    return; // No wall found !!!
}




I dunno if it works!!! just from the top of my head and I haven't tried it, its the only thing I can think of without needing the use of waypoints...!


OH BTW, because this doent show pipes, the line, if( (BotCheckWallOnLeft)  (BotCheckWallOnRight) )       

should be if( (BotCheckWallOnLeft) <OR>(BotCheckWallOnRight) )

If you use that method you will also have to set the flag to tell them NOT to avoid walls for a little while otherwise they will turn away from the wall when they head towards it and will never be close enough to the wall to place the tripmine.
