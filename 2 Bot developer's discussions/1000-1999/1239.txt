I would like to thank everyone that helped me port botmans bot to DoD. Botman thanks to all you tips, code, and of course your bot. 

Thanks elite for your kind help and tips.

Thanks to anyone else I missed.
Hopefully my DoD bot gets better and better.

Chaps,

How about helping me do the same now? :-)

Pointers to the old threads, or at least topics which I can search on would be a great help.

Go easy on me heh, its 2+ years since I wrote a bot for Quake2.

Cheers, S

Yep, in the game now. Right now the version is out doesn't have waypoints or any sort of smart navigation. But the skills are way too hard. Changed that. Got a menu in it now, and working on my waypoints/infopoints navigation.

Spartan what kind of help do you need?
