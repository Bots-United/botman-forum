I wonder if someone had problems with compiling SDK2.0 in Borland running on WindowsMe. I had. And I want to say BOTMAN that the way he said to compile HL.DLL in Borland doesn't work in WinMe.
You must add X:\BORLNAD\BCC55;X:\Borland\Bcc55\include and then you must type "MAKE" , when you are in that folder( "cd X:\Fullsdk\dlls\" then "make")

You didn't say what to add "X:\BORLNAD\BCC55;X:\Borland\Bcc55\include" to (what file?).

And yes, you MUST be in the SourceCode\dlls folder when you run the "make" command.  This is clearly described in the section called "Running the Borland compiler:" in the ReadMe.txt file included in the borland_sdk.zip file available from my "Borland" web page.

QUOTE:
...Now change to the dlls directory where you installed the Valve SDK...

D:\Borland> CD \Half-Life\SDK\SourceCode\dlls
D:\Half-Life\SDK\SourceCode\dlls>

...then run "make" (without quotes) to build the DLL file..

D:\Half-Life\SDK\SourceCode\dlls> make

I wanted to tell you thay you can't run file that file:
@ECHO OFF
SET BCC_DIR=C:\Borland\BCC55\
PATH=%BCC_DIR%\bin;%PATH%
cd \Games\FullSDK\dlls\
make

It crashes and (program caused...in...)you can't build DLL. Thats why in AUTOEXEC.bat (it is hidden) you must add that strings , and only after rebooting system you will be able to build DLL typing "cd \FullSDK\dlls" "make"
