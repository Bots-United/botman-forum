Should I use the Bot #10 source code or the HPB Bot source code to adapt a bot to a mod I don't have the source code for?  For example, adapting a bot for Deathmatch Classic.

Thanks much.

If you don't have the source code for the MOD you will have to use the HPB template. If you are planning to make a bot for DMC and prefer Bot#10 you could wait until the new SDK is released (that will contain the DMC source).

Correct.  If you have the MOD source code, it is much easier to use the Bot Number 10 source code to add a bot to your MOD.

If you don't have the MOD source code you will have to use the HPB bot template source (or one of the other Counter-Strike bot sources that are available on other web sites).

Thanks.

I'm fairly -- no, extremely new to programming in general.  With proper education, I hope to adapt a bot to the Day of Defeat mod.

A lot of work, I'm sure, but what better a way to learn than with the god of all games?  :)
