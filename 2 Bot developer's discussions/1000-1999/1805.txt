hi!

short (and I think) easy question to you: how can I do a quick check in CS which weapons are available on a map? (needed for the buy-decisions...)

thanks for hints

Is this on servers WITH or WITHOUT AdminMod & MetaMOD (because it makes a difference)?

it would be for a normal "HL-fresh-install" listen-server without any addon-installations.

the best would be a general solution which works with and without any admin-tools (if such a solution exists)...

It would probably be best to check Counter-Strike Dedicated Server Admin sites to see what (if) server variables control which weapons can be selected by players.  Admin MOD does this by intercepting the request to buy a weapon and disallows it even if the MOD has no way of controlling which weapons can be selected.

hmmm....

I dont think that I have to look for some cvars set by an admin: on certain cs maps, some weapons are not available (like on oilrig, you cant buy a shotgun and other stuff also) - I really have no knowledge of mapping, but it must
be encoded somewhere in the map itself...

the weaponlist itself is send allways in full length - even when a certain weapon will not appear in the menu..

How do you handle such an uncertainty of not beeing sure if the buy-decision really ends in having a weapon without complicated (and also a little bit ugly) try-and-error-behaviour?
(buy-commands - look if I now carry the weapon - if not, try something else...)

btw: as you mention cvars, I have another short question - why did you register the bot-cvar in your templatecode?? 
what is the use of it?

I don't know much about anything, but in PODBot, all weapon availabilities are specified in one of the bot config files, and if you change them then bots can actually buy weapons they're not allowed (I think) - i.e. weapon availabilites is not checked for, but rather it is set manually.

The "bot" CVAR is used by the dedicated server code to allow server admins to execute bot commands. (i.e. bot "addbot 1 5")

ok - thank you for your support!

I'm still trying to find an easy way to check which weaps can be bought. one way could be, to let the bot open all the buy menus and check the second value (WriteShort) of the VGUI-Message - it contains a bitmask of the fields you can use with the shown VGUI-Menu. but thats also a little bit circumstantial...

Why don't u just check if it's an as_ map ? Then u can just hardcode what weapons can be bought by the diffenrt teams, so u don't need too much code for automatically looking which weapons are available
