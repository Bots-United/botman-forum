i started working on supporting the opera on my bot (Akimbot) but saw on Botman`s main page that he may be supporting the opera on hpb.

i found a workaround for the crash problem in Opera, if that is the only problem holding botman from adding opera th HPB_Bot, i`ll be happy to help on that because i already managed to get bots in the game but it far to different from the other mods. i`m sure botman could do this better.
