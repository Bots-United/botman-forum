Im not sure if its ok to post about Half-Life coding in gerneral in this forum, so if you only want bot-related coding questions in this forum feel free to delete this post, ok botman?

Anyways, here goes.

I want to implement bandages into my mod. I know how to make the player start bleeding, but how do I make it so the player stops bleeding after using an "item_bandage"?

I also want to make it so you can drag corpses around after hitting your "use" key on them and hitting it again will stop dragging the corpse. How would I go about doing that? I want to implement that feature because Im making a "Hitman: Codename 47" mod and want you to be able to hide corpses and juggle around corpses by shooting them

Please help.

Hi,

If you want it to stop when you pick up an item_bandage, put it in MyTouch.

If you're going to have them as a weapon, put the code in PrimaryAttack.

Is this mod single player or multiplayer ?

It will focus on singleplayer but there will also be multiplayer (multiplayer will be alot like the game "Perfect Dark". Its cooperative singleplayer where one person plays as the good guys and the other plays all the bad guys in the level).

Stop by my website for more info.

"if you can compile it for me or send me a copy of Borland C++ I would really appreciate it"

Matt, it would be just as easy for you to download the Borland C++ compiler as it would be for someone to e-mail it to you.  If you're making a single player game, you'll need either Borland C++ or Microsoft Visual C++ to build the Full SDK.

For Half-Life coding questions you might get better responses from the coding forum at wavelength (www.planethalflife.com/wavelength), however the quality of the responses on wavelength have gone down somewhat in the last 6 months (ever since BigGuy, Pink and others have gotten sidetracked with their own MODs they don't show up on wavelength anymore).

Brendan's responses were correct about the bandage usage.

For the corpses you will probably have to modify the bodyque stuff in CBasePlayer::StartDeathCam().  The bodyque will hold dead bodies until the server decides to remove them (to keep too many temp entities laying about).  You would probably have to create some method of managing the dead bodies yourself.  Create a model for a dead player that you can USE and spawn that when the player dies (much like creating the weapon box stuff).

When the player USEs this dead body, you could use code similar to CBasePlayerItem::AttachToPlayer() to "attach" the corpse to the player (and have it follow the player around).  You'll need an attachment point for the corpse model (see how weapon models are done for this).  Dragging corpses around will probably look VERY strange if the player goes up or down a ladder since the corpse will probably stick straight out in the air as the player goes up or down.

Botman, I did post on the Wavelength forums. But it usaully takes forever before someone responds or I get a stupid response.

Thanks for the dragging corpse thing, Ill try it.

And about BorldandC++, I went to the homepage you provided but it asked for you to register and give out your phone number and everything which I refuse to do. So I was hoping someone who was already registered could send me a copy. I will be getting Microsoft Visual C++ if I can find it cheap off Ebay, but that most likely wont happen.

Hi,

I was thinking about the corpse thing yesterday, and another solution maybe to have the player pick the body up (over the shoulder) so instead of a weapon, you see legs. You'd move slower, and have to throw the body before you could use a weapon. That's exactly how it works in Deus Ex, come to think of it :)

Do you want to be able to drag monster bodies, or humans (in multiplayer) ?

Also, having physics as good as hitman is probably impossible (or very hard) with the half-life engine.

In single-player, are you going to have a first or third person perspective? or switchable ?

Are you going to make the mod open-source (see open-source jailbreak) so we can work on it?

good luck,
-Spyro

Thats alot of questions! Ill try to answer them if I can remember them all

1. Its both third person and first person (you can decide what view you want)

2. In multiplayer (and singleplayer) I want to be able to pick up any dead body. Whether its another player online, or a gaurd or civilian in singleplayer

3. The mod will not be open-source UNLESS when its done it doesnt attract alot of attention, then Ill release the sourcecode.
