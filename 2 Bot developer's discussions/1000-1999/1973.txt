I'm creating a bot for holy wars , just to get my hands into bot programming. After adding all entities to link_func, I added a Holy Wars entry to h_export but I got a undeclared identifier error when compiled. The entry goes: 
 else if (strcmpi(mod_name, "Holy Wars") == 0)
   {
mod_id = HOLYWARS_DLL; //line the error is on
#ifndef __linux__
         h_Library = LoadLibrary("holywars\\dlls\\holywars.dll");
#else
h_Library = dlopen("holywars/dlls/front_i386.so", RTLD_NOW);
#endif
   }
Removing that line allows an error free compile but (I think) is the cause of the crash at startup of a lan game. How can this be fixed?

You have to define HOLYWARS_DLL. Look where the other constants (like VALVE_DLL) are defined and add yours there.

Thanks I found the def's, and it compiled fine, but it's still crashing on me...

You know that you have to write new message functions for a new MOD as well, don't you? In this file where you've got valveWeaponList and all that stuff you'll need holywarsWeaponList and you've got to initialize it all. Search for references to the variable mod_id in all source files and look what you have to extend there.

Also check the UTIL_BuildFilename() function in util.cpp (it creates filenames based on the MOD that is currently running).

Just search for VALVE_DLL in visual if you have visual :P, and add the things for your mod on the end.

Yes it's that easy.

I was blindly following botman's tutorial that came with template 3. I've added an entry to each of the places where I've found mention of valve_dll. Got a holy wars bot up and running. Almost done with some simple naigation. Thanks for the help.
