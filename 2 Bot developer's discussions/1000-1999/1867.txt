I've notice my bots are trying to shoot the ground directly underneath enemies or trying to shoot their toes! The only enemies this happens with are the ones I have told my bots to shoot in my BotFindMonsters function!!!

Is there anything that would cause the bots shooting underneath enemies???

another prob is (my bot is for the MOD : rocket crowbar!) that bots would attack players that had been been kicked from the server. 

I remember botman finding this problem with holy wars, is there a simple fix?

Hi,

The origin for monsters is their feet. Don't ask me why.

so:
code:

Vector monster_origin = pEnt->v.origin + (pEnt->v.view_ofs/2);



should do the trick, provided the view offset is stored correctly.

Thanks spyro, matey!!! The bots shoot the monsters slightly below the origin though! I dunno if thats the botskills' fault though..
