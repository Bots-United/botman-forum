snif...

I have wanted to clean a little the HPB source code to keep only the code for TFC

and now, the bot when they spawn and respawn, the run a little and they are blocked on the first wall they touch
but they aren't already wathing the wall !

I have seen bot blocked on the center of the resupply or other.

and when they are blocked, they look have a bad lag. humm It's difficult to explain. I have uploaded the dll you can see the bug

htpp://www.babeloueb.com/tfclan/download/BotLag.zip


I don't want to call my bot "LagBot", so if you understand my problem, please help me ! thanx..


PS: sorry for my bad english :(

Did you remove the code that checks to see if the bot is about to run into a wall? (BotTurnAtWall)

If you don't keep this function, the bots will run right up against a wall and scrape along it without turning any and move fairly slowly.

Put some debug code (like the "debug_engine" stuff) in the BotTurnAtWall() function to make sure you are calling it from the BotThink() function.
