Like I said in my other post, you can get my source at www.teambot.net

It has goal/return waypoints, but the navigation code isn't finished yet, sorry. At least it will show you how to add in new types of waypoints, with different colors.

You have to add in new waypoint flags in waypoint.h, then add in a new console command for adding in the waypoint in dll.cpp, then you can add in support for drawing goal waypoints in a different color in waypoint.cpp

If you are really stuck email me at ali@elitegamer.fsnet.co.uk and I can write a more detailed explanation ;)

If you are writing a dynamic waypoint builder like the one from my other post, then you may want the bot to write down where bomb points are or where hostages are whenever a hostage entity is within your field of view and recognize the frequency that you may find hostages at some location and visit that location the next time. For bombs, you can do four things: Run until you see a bombzone message broadcasted or if you find a bot or human planted the bomb, up the frequency for where they planted it, up the frequency the general area and damage where the bot died due to the bomb's blast to get a feel of where the bomb site is, and lastly, listen to where things are beeping. I'm pretty sure the last one is client side thing, but then again, for these kinds of things perhaps you should make a generic *.bsp analyzer before starting up any game to save yourself the hassle ;) And to make it seem like bots don't just *know* where to go, have this map analysis engine seperate from the bot engine so it should give the bots a sense of where sound is coming from given their orientation and location. But, this may be something that some programmers may already be working towards either from us lowly programmers or the officials at Valve. Who knows, you need to implement "NEW" ideas ;)

erm, you can find easily a bomb by searhing for the entity GRENADE (using findbyclassname) and then check its model if its a C4... then you know where the C4 is... 

then whatever you want to do with any CT bots to let it defuse, let it concentrate on that vector and voila.

Also, same for bomb spots and hostages..
