Is it possible to make a menu that holds client names that are currently on your team from fake clients to clients and is it possible to keep this menu current? I also want to know if it is possible to enter text into the menu like lets say you have 'addbots "x"'(x being the int that the server puts in to add that number of random bots 1-31 :)...???... :P

Yes, you can build the menus on the fly (just before displaying them).  The player names can be accessed from the pev->netname field in the player's edict structure.  Just loop through the clients and use "STRING(pev->netname)" or "STRING(pEdict->v.netname)" to access the player's names.

Here's a link to a good tutorial on the old style text menus...
