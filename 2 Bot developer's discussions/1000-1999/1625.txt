Client-side bots...
Possible? Only by using a actual HALF-LINE CLIENT!
The only way I know of is having a .cfg file excute commands like on a certain map, Face this direction this height then up,up,up,up,up,strafe left, sl,ect... then you need some program that locks on to certain colors (like the aimbot) which is kinda shitty.. Is there a way you could tell it a cord? (x,y, to next point with a backround proggie or something?)

The problem is that using the default client.dll for a MOD doesn't give you the ability to determine the location of a bot (the origin).  You also can't create a bind script complex enough to handle moving and firing.  You can't do any kind of looping (with control) using the bind scripts.

I think DeltaShark provided the "simplest" method of creating a client side bot by hijacking the client.dll and hooking into the engine functions from there.

How is the client.dll checked if it is the right dll?

I believe that the Half-Life engine does a CRC32 check on the client.dll located on the server and compares that to the CRC of the client.dll on the client.  If the CRC's aren't the same, the engine on the client side won't let you connect to the server.

Correct. 'Your Client.dll does not match the servers, get lost buddy'.

I'll ATTEMP to make my bind bot just to learn some new hl commands, the last script I made was a grenade spam recreation once I saw someone crash the server with smoke grenades, which was a long time ago.

It uses MD5 checking. CRC32 can be easy faked. But it is still possible.
