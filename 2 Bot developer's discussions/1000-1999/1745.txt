If you use a remote application, you can send the "status" command and recieve the data that that command gives you. same with "users", but what about your own command? Would ALERT() do this? I need to dump text which can be picked up remotly _without_ using the log.

thanks,

Remote commands are almost always handled using the "rcon" command.  You can add custom server commands in a way similar to how I added the bot commands using an CVAR called "bot".

Look through the HPB bot template source code for where I handle the "bot" CVAR.  For example,

rcon "bot addbot"

...would add a bot on the server.  Make your own CVAR and store the command you want to execute in it.  Then have that command do what you want.

adding the actual command is no problem, I used a method very much like your bot cvar, and added a couple of new comands with the pfnAddServerCommand engine function. The problem is getting data back to the remote client without using the log, as the log can only dump to one address at a time which would be worthless for a multiple user system.

Your best bet would be to create a separate TCP/IP socket connection between server and client.  Then you can pass whatever data you want back and forth.  An alternative might be to use the CLIENT_COMMAND() function to send a command back to the client.  This command could contain the response as arguments (but would be limited in size).

When I said "client" I didn't mean a Half-Life client (I guess I should have stated it some other way).  The client I'm talking about is the network client that is used to control a server (sort of like an irc client).  Obviously the CLIENT_COMMAND() function would do you no good in this sort of external client application.
