Is it possible to check whether the console is pulled down?

I have some binds to some bot commands and the commands get executed when type something in the console - it could be nice to prevent this.

When you pull down the console, the Half-Life engine clock stops (but the Windows system clock does not).  When you start a map, store the difference between the Windows system clock and the Half-Life game clock (gpGlobals->time).  Keep checking periodically to make sure that this difference didn't suddenly get several seconds larger (indicating that the console had been pulled down for some period of time, or the player had ESCaped back to the Half-Life menu).

You'll need to periodically re-syncronize the delta between the Half-Life clock and the Windows clock (since they won't be dead on accurate).
