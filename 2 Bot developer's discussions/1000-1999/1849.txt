This isnt exactly bot related but help would be handy, is there an alternative way of getting commands to a server? i.e Not using the RCON protocol. I'm not sure but Gamehost I think uses some kind of external DLL to handle this.

thanks,

nm I have worked out a very nice method of my own using a Serverside DLL and external program for data distibution between all remote clients and it works _very_ well.
