ok I made my bots use Team Waypoints but they seem not to work right.  I set some waypoints only as certain spots and it still won't work.

Like I set a waypoint as Red Team but blue uses it and red and it's backwards for the blue team it doesn't matter they just don't use team points they ignore them.

Thanx if you can help.

Make sure that you are passing in the correct value for the team in the waypoint functions that require them (assuming you're using waypoint functions from the HPB bot template code).

Be careful when setting team waypoints.  This doesn't sound like your problem, but in the past I've had problems when waypointing maps where I'll forget to make sure that bots can get to the waypoints they should be able to.  For example, I had a long string of waypoints leading to a flag in CASBAH.  I marked one of the waypoints midway along as team specific for team 2 (to put a sentry gun there).  The bots on team one couldn't get to the red team's flag because there was only one path leading to it and one of the waypoints in the middle was only accessible by team 2.

I would suggest adding some debug output to your waypoint navigation code and put some debug in the waypoint functions to indicate if they aren't finding a waypoint match for that team.
