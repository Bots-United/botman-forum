Ok some of you might remember me some of you may bot.Now i really dont care what any of you think in all honesty.The people here are much like the people on battle.net(assholes).Now the point of all those words was to show you i can handle what-ever is involved in programming a cs bot.Thats it,im totally opposed to hacking and the concept unless your going to make a statement in doing so.Im no hacker just a programmer.Dont be morons.

Now BotMan in reference to your answer which was put quit politely and quit nice(thankyou btw.I can see out of the people that answered your the only onw with the maturity to give me a serious response and clarify my mistake).Well in response to it to put it plainly im pretty sure with enough packet logs and some coffee i can surely make one(with time too ;D)The blowfish source is ALL over the net...so to generate w/e it is needed to generate wouldne be that hard.Goto palnet source code.com(no spaces) and look it up in VB.Simple but im not trying to make for cs what i did for battle.net.
So i guess ill find somewhere else to try to make this type of bot cause it IS a great challenged and an awesome thing to spend time on.So thankyou botman for your time.
NOw in reference to that loser who'sname i cant remember where he threatend to tell b.net or did tell b.net or w/e..buddy they cant do shit.The only thing they do is ip ban you if they detect fraud and i alraedy quit b.net...so rweally you wasted your time idiot and i didnt come to the wrong board.I came to the right one,the question is are you in the right one? Also i will not persue a childish name calling contest with you.I dont care for you or what you do.That message was addressed toward other people not you.So dont expect me to come back here and respodn to your childish,immature,and frankly gay name calling.
Thankyou for your time everyone and you botman too for being (as said b4) the only one with maturity to clarify my mistake in what YOUR type of bots were.If you would like to chat with me botman my icq is 84497771.You seem like the kind of person with intelligence and maturity that i could enjoy a nice chat with.
Good-Bye.

Here's a link to Blowfish encryption source code if anyone is interested in taking a look at it...

http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish-download.html

You may also want to review the web site where this came from...

Moralz, if you want an application that can easily capture the Half-Life network packets, you should take a look at my NetProbe code...

http://planethalflife.com/botman/netprobe.shtml

...it acts as a proxy between the Half-Life server and the client (logging transmitted and received packets to a text file as they are sent back and forth).  I had intended to modify this to allow MOD developers to easily gauge how much network traffic was being sent by their MODs so that they would be able to reduce lag in the released version of the MOD.  I never got around to adding peg counters and what not to keep statistics on size and number of packets being sent per second.

There have been several other people that have attempted to create client side bots for Half-Life and none have succeeded.  I suspect that the network encryption and the fact that the network protocol is completely undocumented has frustrated many of these developers to the point where they were unable to create a working project.

As for ICQ, I don't use it.  I used to use it but people kept pestering me when I was online and I eventually had to leave privacy mode turned on all the time.  Since I was always in privacy mode I decided to stop using ICQ.  I also don't use AOL instant messenger and I don't have the time or the patience to sit around in an IRC chat room discussing such things as what my favorite beverage is when I'm writing code or whether or not I've played Super-Mega-Minesweeper version 6.7

So, I doubt we will ever have "a nice chat", but you are free to post bot related discussions here.  I prefer that people keep discussions on topic and don't post messages that will cause a flame war.  I also don't want people posting message that are purely meant to insult or offend anyone as a group.  Like you said, people should be mature enough to post messages in an intelligent manner.  If people can't do that then please find somewhere else to post your messages.

You're right Morlaz, I shouldnt have name-called, that was very childish and immature of me. I just have very little respect for cheaters and hackers due to personal experiences with people messing up my computer.

But what I dont understand, is that after saying that Im childish and immature, you name-called right back, what does that show of your maturity?

I didn't notice that! But it's a typo, he's made LOADS of spelling mistakes in there...

And I didn't think he wanted to hack into HL, I wasn't sure, but what exactly is he trying to do?? Make a bot like HPB bot, or some other thing that monitors the network packets?
