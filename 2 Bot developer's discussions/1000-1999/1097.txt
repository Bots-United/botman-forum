I am intrested in know if anyone has or will make versions of the HPB Bot source that are stripped for just certain mods with the new code.

I want to make a bot and know what to do now that i have read alot but i don't want to start taking stuff out and screw something up. All i need is the stripped source for CS just so they can still have all the features but a smaller DLL size because of all the crap that has been taken out. 

thanks for your time.

I think that more than just 1 person is wanting this.  I just downloaded the HPB source code yesterday and I am in the process of dissecting the HPB source code template into a CS code base.  Maybe someone has beat me to it?

It only takes about 1 minute to d/l the DLL anyway, it's TINY!! Why would u want to do this??? When u r satisfied with the way your bot working in 1 mod, u could get it working in another mod! I am primarily developing for CS, but the navigation code I am making for Cs will also work well for TFC CTF!!! Then ppl can just d/l 1 DLL, and run bots from 2 games out of that 1 DLL!!

There is hardly any mod specific stuff in the HPB_bot anyway, but you can simply search for the variable mod_id, and then u will get most of the team specific stuff, but then u can search for things like FLF, FRONTLINE, TFC, and u will be able to remove all the bot_client.cpp mod specific functions, and all the mod specific waypoint flags. I doubt you'd mess much up, bcoz these functions should be called if u r only using it for another mod. Also edit the code where it says "MOD not supported by HPB_bot!!!", make sure it will also say that for TFC and FLF, and that ppl won't be able to use your bot in another mod by mistake...

I still think it's a good idea to leave the mod specific stuff in, bcoz if a new mod (like Hostile Intent) comes out that u like, u will have a better idea of where to add in the new code... I don't think Botman is going to add in new mod support just for u!!

I've found a way to make my Dll for my bot about 85k!!! Amazing eh.  So now I can include more waypoint files as well faster downloads always better <b>(I must say)</b>
