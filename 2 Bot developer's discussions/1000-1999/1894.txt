This will probably be my last post for a while.
I have made a lot of improvements to both the ABot, HPB_bot, and TEAM_bot; aswell as my own cmdMOD (i.e. like adminMOD).

My last question is:
How can I make player's invisible?  PoDBot does it and I was wondering how?  I've tried all sorts of things but nothing ever worked out.  I'll post my s/c to the cmdMOD once I get player invisibility going.  Thanks a lot guys!

BOTMAN FOREVER!

You can make a player immune to gunfire by setting the takedamage field to DAMAGE_NO.

pPlayer->pev->takedamage = DAMAGE_NO.

But he will still be affected by explosions and grenades. To prevent that you have to set his solid mode to SOLID_NOT.

pPlayer->pev->solid = SOLID_NOT.

That has the drawback that he cant pickup weapons, touch buttons or open doors.

There are many different render modes that you can use on models.  See the common\const.h file and seach for "render" to find render modes and render effects (Fx).  For example, if you wanted to make a player have a glow shell (like the flags in TFC have), you could do this...
code:
pEdict->v.rendermode = kRenderNormal;
pEdict->v.renderfx = kRenderFxGlowShell;

pEdict->v.rendercolor.x = 0;  // red
pEdict->v.rendercolor.y = 0;  // green
pEdict->v.rendercolor.z = 255; // blue

pEdict->v.renderamt = 10;  // glow shell distance from entity

...This would create a blue glowing shell around the player.  The "hologram" effect in the Half-Life traning course instructor (gina) is done in a similar fashion.  You can adjust the render color and render ammount (renderamt) for various render modes to acheive various effects (like invisibility).

Of course this will only effect human players and not the bots, since the bots don't have to see you to be able to target and shoot at you.
