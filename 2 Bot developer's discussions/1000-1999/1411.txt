In the new Valve dedicated server, bots get kicked after 3 or so minutes. I am running CS MOD using de_dust map. The bots are moving, but they are kicked after the idle timer comes in. Is there a way to prevent bots from being kicked? I'm thinking about intercepting idle kicks for bots and ignoring that. I'm also guessing (my vague expertise on HL engine) that it might be that it checks for weapon fire or something. This gets pretty annoying to see the bots get kicked when debugging.

On the Half-Life menu, go into the "Advanced options" menu in the "Create game" menu and turn off the "Kick idle or disruptive players", then click on "Done".  Select the map you want and click on "Ok".

So there isn't already a way to prevent the engine from kicking fake clients? I don't like inferior workarounds--pardon for the expression. Maybe I can find some way to do this. Give me a week ;)

Also, on your news today:

"I've also noticed what I think is a bug in HolyWars where the players sometimes stop doing damage to each other (you shoot and shoot and shoot and nobody gets hurt).  I don't think this is a bot thing, but I've only see it one time during the few hours that I was playing the game."

This occurs in CS 1.0. I'm unsure if it does in CS 1.1. It depends on where the players are positioned. For instance, in cs_italy in the cellar, if a player ducks between the two drums there is a spot where, I found by chance, the player would not be hit. This also means a player facing the one between the drums and ducking down also will appear to shoot blanks. This "bug" also happens in de_dust. These correlations doesn't mean that it always happen. It just means in some respect, you could be getting damaged when you should be the one inflicting damage.
