I know this is not bot related but I need help with using Djgpp. Instead of updating the autoexec.bat I made a djgpp.bat with the command
code:
@echo off
set PATH=D:\djgpp\bin;%PATH%
set DJGPP=D:\djgpp\djgpp.env
chdir D:\djgpp\mystuff   
command


When I try to compile it says error installed wrong or something like. I placed this file in the Djgpp folder.. Help!

make sure you put "D:" before changing the folder :)

this is my bat file for using my borland :D

path=e:\borland\bcc55\bin
make -B -fmakefile_borland
copy E:\TC\HPB_BOT\DLLS\sh0f00.dll D:\Half-life\cstrike\dlls

If you add this to the autoexec.bat file (under Win95 or Win98) it will run everytime you restart your computer.  You can also add it to a file in your Windows directory called "dosstart.bat" and it will run everytime you use "Start->Programs->MS-DOS Prompt".

If you don't add it to autoexec.bat or dosstart.bat then you will have to manually run the .bat file every time you create an MS-DOS window.

Hmm... If anybody can help me I would be very happy. After I updated Half-life to 1106. I played Cs, Dod and stuff over the net. Then i find out that half-life keeps making that stupid save folder outside on My D: drive! What I mean is, instead of the save folder being in sierra/half-life folder half-life automatically creates a Save folder outside the sierra folder! It's getting annoying erasing the folder everytime. So plz help.

Well you don't need to erase the folder :)     Maybe you could make it 'hidden' if you don't use 'Show All Files' (but you should use Show All Files). I don't have 1106 so I don't know what is going wrong
