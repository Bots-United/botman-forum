I keep getting this error message I think whenever a UTIL_ClientPrintAll is used, it reads:

Host_Error: UserMsg: Not present on client 113

I just started a listen server and was the only one in at the time.

Any help greatly appriciated,

WEll that sounds like just a shortcut to send ing a "say" command like you would in the console, I need the clientprints as some of my messages are to a single person and I dont wantthe <SERVERNAME> part at the beginning:
Ok I have confirmed that the error only happens then ClientPrint or UTIL_ClientPrintAll are used, it may be due to the following modifications, bear in mind this is based on botmans stripper mod and I did have the clientprints working earlier today so this is really baffling me:

in eiface.h  around lne 255 I added:

void            (*pfnAddServerCommand)            ( char *cmd_name, void (*function) (void) );

in extdll.h around line 137 I added:

#define ADD_SERVER_COMMAND (*g_engfuncs.pfnAddServerCommand )

in dll.cpp I used the add server command like so:
ADD_SERVER_COMMAND("test",testroutine);

The command "test" does work.

The DLL functions 100% apart from this problem with the clientprint, those above are the only modifications I have never made before,

thanks,

- Rob.
