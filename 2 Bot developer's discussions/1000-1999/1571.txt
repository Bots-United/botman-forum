Erm, I want to add new waypoint types to the HPB bot v3 (such as 'bomb' waypoints) but how do I do it? any suggestions/help/code?

Add new W_FL_xxxxx bit masks to the waypoint.h file.  You'll see the exising ones in there already.  Note how the same bit position is used for different things in different MODs.

Also notice that you can use the same bit-number-thing twice for similar waypoints.

eg if the W_FL_FLAG type has a value of 1<<13 then you could make waypoints for CS like this W_FL_BOMB 1<<13 since it is a different mod and you would want to keep that maximum number of waypoint types free for use in future.

I simply use W_FL_GOAL for both bomb AND hostage waypoints, as you won't need both (unless you want the bots to do a map with a bombspot AND hostages like jeepathon_2k but that is just stupid and is not what CS is intended for!)
