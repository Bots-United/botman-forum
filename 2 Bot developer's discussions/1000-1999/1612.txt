hi

I need some help on the sniper waypoint handling code in BotThink().

I just dont get it. Why does the time
"pBot->f_sniper_aim_time" always keep updated even though at first is 0.0 in BotSpawnInit(). That's why the rest of the code after the checking

"if (pBot->f_sniper_aim_time <= gpGlobals->time)"
is not executed because the "pBot->f_sniper_aim_time " is always updated and this cause the condition checking above to be false.

Help!

If you look at the original HPB bot template code, f_sniper_aim time is set to 0.0 in BotSpawnInit() and then (if the MOD is TFC), the f_sniper_aim time is updated to a new time (current time + RANDOM(3.0, 5.0)).

This means that every 3 to 5 seconds the f_sniper_aim time will be reset to a time in the future (but only if the MOD is TFC).

This is used to keep the camping sniper bot from constantly aiming on one direction (looking like the player is frozen in place).  The aim will be adjusted randomly +/- 15 degress everytime f_sniper_aim time becomes less than the current time.

        // check if the waypoint is a sniper waypoint AND
      // bot isn't currently aiming at an ememy...
      
        if ((waypoints[pBot->curr_waypoint_index].flags & W_FR_CAMP) &&
          (pBot->pBotEnemy == NULL))
      {
          ALERT( at_console, "Camp 1\n");
            // check if it's time to adjust aim yet...
            char msg[80];
          sprintf(msg,"sniper time= %f\n",pBot->f_sniper_aim_time);
          ALERT( at_console, msg);
          sprintf(msg,"global time= %f\n",gpGlobals->time);
          ALERT( at_console, msg);

          if (pBot->f_sniper_aim_time <= gpGlobals->time)
            {
               int aim_index;
                        ALERT( at_console, "Camp 2\n");
               aim_index = WaypointFindNearestAiming(waypoints[pBot->curr_waypoint_index].origin);

               if (aim_index != -1)
               {
                  ALERT( at_console, "Camp 3\n");
                           Vector v_aim = waypoints[aim_index].origin - waypoints[pBot->curr_waypoint_index].origin;

                  Vector aim_angles = UTIL_VecToAngles( v_aim );

                  aim_angles.y += RANDOM_LONG(0, 30) - 15;


              pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = aim_angles.y;

                  BotFixIdealYaw(pEdict);
               }

               // don't adjust aim again until after a few seconds...
               pBot->f_sniper_aim_time = gpGlobals->time + RANDOM_FLOAT(3.0, 5.0);

            }
         
      }

I understand what u mean by the updating...but it seems that pBot->f_sniper_aim_time is updated
somewhere else coz i check it using some debug messages up there.

The code didn't go through printing "camp2" and "camp3" but when I checked the time "pBot->f_sniper_aim_time"
it's always updated.??? But the only place to update that is to go through debug message "camp2".
I am baffled.

And one more thing I checked that globals time is less than sniper time by 2 or 3 secs. Why?
