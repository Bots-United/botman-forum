Ok, i've put a little error checking to figure out why my bots no long have any ammo. I write the ammo amount to a file everytime the botfireweapon is called. They just try to but without ammo nothing happens. Any idea where I must of changed this to get it to work. It has nothing to do with the bot_combat.cpp file. I know that.

Thanks,
Dustin

Im not sure but I think in dod you dont have the luxury of autoreload the "+reload" button has to be pressed by the bot I hope this helps :)

Actually thats not the problem. I know they don't reload right now, that is after they run out. The don't even fire any rounds.

I don't think it has anything to do with Ammo. Right now with the function the just click like they are out of ammo. Or thats what is sounds like in the game. But, if I just skip the BotFireWeapon() and just put in the IN_ATTACK part they fire. So I assume its something in there.

If u set IN_ATTACK in the BotFireWeapon() bit it should work. Check in which conditions BotFireWeapon() is used. Maybe it isn't being called. Just go through the combat code line by line and see where something could go wrong... and this will also give u a better understanding of the combat code so u can put in reaction times and stuff.

Also the template 2 BotFireWeapon() is much more complicated than the first. I have left it intact so that the bots will still work with other mods, but I have changed the bit about "if (mod_id == CSTRIKE_DLL)" to just press IN_ATTACK at random... it doesn't check for ammo levels yet, Im' still unsure how all the primary ammo and secondary ammo stuff relates to the CS ammo amounts, as whenever I have tried to add in ammo checking b4 it didn't work =(

I got it to work but the reason is I think any how not too sure because I dont know what he has but I think he has gone in and made 2 instances of the call cause when i add a bot it adds one bot but the call runs twice due to the taking where ever it says tfc and halflife dm and putting in dod is what it seems like hes done not too sure though hope he figures it out too cause I like having some one to bot with. :)
