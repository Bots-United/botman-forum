HI! I've made internet counter written on DELPHI.
(It prints GIF into console like all counters - CGI and browser must get it) I know it works, but I am sending it on server, that I am trying to call it from HTML like
<img source="http://.../counter.exe"> but there is no image. Other counters (from other sites) are work. Plz help
P.S. I've tried to do it from my machine (counters, CGI applications), but nothing.

Is your CGI server and your HTTP server running on the same machine?  If not, then you probably can't use CGI scripts in your HTTP files.

Get your HTTP host to put a CGI server on the same machine, otherwise there's nothing you can do.
