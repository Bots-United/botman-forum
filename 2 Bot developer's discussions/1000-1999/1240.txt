In Bot_combat I am adding the secondary reload along side the primary reload (using botman's new template).  When I go to compile it says IN_RELOAD2 isnt defined, so I searched my workspace to see where IN_RELOAD was defined, but it didnt show up.  My question is, why does IN_RELOAD2 need to be defined but IN_RELOAD doesnt?  Or is IN_RELOAD defined some where else that I am missing?  Thanks

Well, never mind, just as soon as I post this I happen to look in the "common" folder.  Thanks anyway

There is no IN_RELOAD2 because there is no such action in the game. You have a secondary fire, but you don't have a special reload for that.

the mod I am making a bot for uses IN_RELOAD2.  That is why I was needing it.

If a MOD is using bit flags not defined in the Half-Life SDK then you will have to figure them out by trial and error or write to the MOD coders to ask what value corresponds to these new bit fields.
