Im trying to setup a multi boot system so I can have Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Mandrake Linux 7.2 installed all on the same system for flexability. however this is where my problem is.

I partioned the and installed win98 to c: drive win2k to d: drive and then installed linux to its own partion. I start up my computer in joy but then relize that it came up with a menu asking me to boot into linux, linuxfb and windows (few other options but i forgot) and i selected windows. But then i am brought to another screen that is asking if i would like to boot into windows 2k or 98. is it possible to have only one menu to have to go to in order to load both windows and linux?

I have also tried some boot loader software but that just add's a 3rd menu. can someone plz help

Also i am going by the win/linux boot guide from tweak3d.net and when i use bootpart it doesnot find my linux partion.

You could edit the lilo.conf file in /etc

I've only used Linux for a few days about 2 weeks ago, so I can't remember much about the file...

After you've edited the lilo.conf file to the way you like it, just run lilo, then reboot and see what your bootmenu is like

If that doesn't help then I'll ask my dad :P , but what's wrong with two bootmenus? Honestly, some ppl...

Well I think that the Windows Bootmenu will be in Autoexec.bat on your C: drive... that may be the only way to start up windows - so you will have to get lilo to run a different .bat (call it exec2000.bat or something?) for Win2k (I still can't remember how lilo chooses to boot up from Windoze instead of Linux...), or maybe just install Win2k on another drive and have an option to boot from each drive... I have 2 HDs, I had Win2k and Win98 on one, and Linux on the other, but at the moment I've just got Win98.

I thought having the second menu was pretty cool atually - the first menu takes u to a crossroads, Windoze or Linux. And only once u choose the evil Windoze partition do u have to go into a further Windoze selection...
