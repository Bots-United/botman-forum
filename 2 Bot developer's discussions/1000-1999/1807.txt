I am having some difficulty with a piece of code designed to calculate the difference in pitch between where the player is looking and the origin of another player. This pitch calculation is used to adjust the pitch of the player's view (e.g. if the player is lower than where the bot is aiming, then it needs to adjust by looking down until the pitch difference is zero). The problem is that based on the information provided by my pitch calculator, the bot always shoots just below the target's feet. Debugging info shows that my pitch function is returning zero at this point (I would like it to return zero when the bot’s aim is lined up with the middle of the target). The bot aims up or down when its target goes higher or lower, but is always aiming just a bit below the target.

Here is the (abridged) code:

code:

float CBot::pitch_to_player(int lookPlayerNum)
{
      // Get a pointer to the player (pPlayerToFind)
      // [ NOT INCLUDED ]

      // Get the pitch of the vector from the bot to the player's body ("raw pitch")
      Vector toplayer = pPlayerToFind->pev->origin – EyePosition();
      float rawPitchToPlayer = UTIL_VecToAngles(toplayer).x;

      // Get the pitch of the current viewing angle
      float viewPitch = pev->v_angle.x;

      // The calculated pitch will be the difference
      float pitch = rawPitchToPlayer - viewPitch;

      // Return the difference (pitch from where the bot is looking)
      return pitch;
}



It seems like this should be a fairly straightforward calculation. Is there some type of fundamental flaw in my logic?

pev->origin - EyePosition() would be near the feet.  The head of the player is pev->origin + EyePosition()
