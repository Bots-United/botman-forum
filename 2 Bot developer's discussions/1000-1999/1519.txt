Okay, done with anti-tk code like I promised. Took a couple of days to understanding how the general layout of Half Life worked. It's also very similar to Quake's open source SDK (but Quake's is more detailed). Overall, it has been a good experience. I'm usually working on kernel level device drivers for NT if not developing utilities, or exploiting ntoskrnl.exe. Anyway, about the anti-tk thing. It's Half Life Referee (HLREF). HLREF can load a single MOD like HPBBot.dll or PODBot.dll and give bots anti-tk protection, and all players of course. So far I've seen positive effects in FF=ON games. People become suprised that they no longer enjoy TK'ing on HLREF servers =) There's one thing I didn't employ which is client queries about their own TK'ing statistics (it's obvious to trap this from ClientCommand handler), but people will abuse it. My opinion is that if people know how many people they can kill before getting kicked, then they will time it correctly. If they have to memorize their statistics while playing the game, then it makes it harder to recall and for most people they don't want to risk being kick/banned having chanced on a wrong guess. I will make it open source later. For now it's pretty messy ;)

lol I think the best idea would be damage mirroring! I don't know if this is a topic which has been discussed much before, but DarkYouth mentioned it and I think it would be better than kicking a player off. You could deal 3 ot 4 times as much damage to the person who is shooting their team-mates, and that should give them enough of a warning (unless they hit their team-mates head, then they will die themselves!)

No, it kicks really really abusive people off. Usually it just gets you to auto-suicide and ruin your beloved score a couple of rounds and from what I've seen from the past two days, it's really effective. Players stop killing each other for the sake of their score.
