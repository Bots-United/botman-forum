Ok botman as you know some time now Ive been working on trying to make a beter nav system to get the bots on but sofar waypoints are what we have most controll over so any how the idea was to get a bot waypoint system that has a scripting language attatched to bot behaviors and movement types that are directed twards custom user waypoints. however Ive gotten this to work with the blitz bot its still kinda buggy and I would like to help you just as much as you have helped me so here in about 2 months me or dustin will release code ither to the public or to you and william and some other people through e-mail just wondering if you are interested.

I would be interested to see some coherent description of what method you use to control the bot, but I'm not really interested in getting any code.

Perhaps you should set up a web site somewhere and clearly state how you plan to control their navigation describing what factors will influence the behavior, etc.

well the scripting language sofar is like html or looks like it any ways you have behavior names that are attatched to behaviors in the dll such as speed i figured that scince most every one has some type of waypoint idea about camping or getting a bot to press a button this would be a way so that you could get bots to do multiple tasks within a single waypoint. However the most things ive had them doing on a single waypoint is jumping and running i wanted to see if they could jump accross this lil broken bridge in dod_valley they never cleared it so i must have had the waypoints too far apart however it comes in handy cause you could also this instead of getting a bot to jump on a box with a waypoint that is attatched to jump you could attatch several jumps to it like forinstance to tell the bot there are more jumps ahead like a scripted sequence in waypoints.thats just an example i havent tried it but it would work in the cs map office prolly any how it also works well with pressing buttons but i just got the first behaviors finnished and havent made button pressing yet so who knows if that will work it seems like it will hopefuly that clears it up a lil bit.
