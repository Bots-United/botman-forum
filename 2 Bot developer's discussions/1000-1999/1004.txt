My bots do no longjump.
It would help to find the code in the SDK where the longjump is made but I don't find it.
There are only some lines to change the animation but where is the velocity changed???
Please help me!

It's set in PM_Jump() in pm_shared.c

I found the bug: I had to give the bots the Longjump module with GiveNamedItem(), but I set m_fLongJump=true.
But now some Bots are moving in slow motion? Has anyone seen this before? Even the gravity seems to be slower. Could it be the calling ofg_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove ?
