I need to know if it's good to convert some any programs code to Macros??

I've already done it in my Bot speeded everything up so to let everybody know it's work great to have your code in macros as long as you know how to change it. :)

Thanx

When you say "Macros", I assume you mean assembly language.  Re-writing routines in assembly language can give you magnitudes of improvement in speed when code is executing.  Like you said, you have to know what you are doing.  Most C and C++ compilers are fairly efficient at generating machine code, however for number crunching algorithms (like 3D math), you can often gain significant improvement by hand coding algorithms in assembly language instead of C or C++.  Of couse you have to know how to write in assembly language before you attempt to do this.  Assembly language is one of the most simple computer languages but it is also one of the most complex to write applications in.

I personally like assembly language, but find that it can be difficult to maintain the code when it isn't very well commented and you spend much more time writting hundreds of lines of assembly language when a few dozen lines of C code will do the same thing almost as efficiently.

Perhaps the best way to target which areas of code would benefit from being converted to assembly language is to use a profiling tool (Visual C++ has one) that allows you to identify which areas of code are executed the most frequently.  Converting these routines to assembly language could give you big improvements in processing speed.

How do you make these macros? I have microsoft visual 6.0 c++.

Botman what I meant to say was to define a macro as in speeding up not using Assembly Language I know some not much to convert code in ASM.

This is a little example:
code:

int Number_1,Number_2;
#define add(a,b) ((a)+(b)) // <--- a Macro much faster than normal code function.

  Number_1 = 14;
  Number_2 = 15;
  printf("A + B = %d",add(Number_1,Number_2));



Just defining a Function as a macro can speed things up within your code if you don't know ASM.

But thanx anyway.

Macros simply do text substitution before the C or C++ code is compiled.  This...

#define add(A,B) ((a)+(b))

z = add(x,y);

...should compile to exactly the same code as...

z = x + y;

In this case the plain C code and the macro do exactly the same thing.  However, if you had this...

int add(int a, int b)
{
   return a + b;
}

z = add(a, b);

...then the macro substitution would be faster than the C function (since the macro effectively becomes an "inline" function and no CPU overhead is required to enter and leave the function).

The C and C++ reserved word "inline" can give you similar results to macros.  But be aware of the fact that if you have a large function, using "inline" for this function will make your compiled code much larger.

Oh oh! How do you get that profiler working?
