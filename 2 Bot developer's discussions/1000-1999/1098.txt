The current method for akimbo switching is below...

if ((WHLBOT_WEAPON_BERETTA) && (WHLBOT_WEAPON_BERETTA))
{
   FakeClientCommand(pEdict, "cycle", NULL, NULL);
}


The bots use akimbo when they have two berettas, i see them run at me with the two guns, but they dont fire, when they get close they pull the bat and do some close quarters combat, but they wont fire the weapon. Any clues as to whats causing this?

The problem is that WHLBOT_WEAPON_BERETTA is only a flag in a bitfield ( I think so ) . when u && two of them, the result will be WHLBOT_WEAPON_BERETTA, therefore it has no effect. pBot->bot_weapons & WHLBOT_WEAPON_BERETTA would be true, if the bot has this weapon.

PS: isn't there a flag like WHLBOT_WEAPON_DOUBLEBERETTA or something similar ?

Yes, u r just checking the SAME THING twice!!!

It would have to be something if ((first_weapon = WHLBOT_WEAPON_BERETTA) && (second_weapon = WHLBOT_WEAPON_BERETTA))
 
But as @$3.1415rin said, the weapon name should be more like WHLBOT_WEAPON_DOUBLEBERETTA, as I doubt that u actually have two different weapons - it is just 'one' weapon, which has double the clip size of the beretta (and probably double the firing rate), but it appears to be two different guns... so maybe u have just not added in all the weapon ids properly??? Check to see if the id changes when u get the double berettas... same with any other akimbo weapons (if there r any) if WHL
