I almost never log in to the forums on gamedesign.net.  Perhaps I misunderstood your original question.  I thought you were asking about the SetUse() function and NOT the SetTouch() function.  The ObjectCaps() won't do anything for a SetTouch() function.

You will need an ObjectCaps() function in your class definition like this...
code:
   int ObjectCaps() { return FCAP_IMPULSE_USE; };

You will also need a Use function for your class like this...
code:
void MyNewClass::Use(CBaseEntity *pActivator, CBaseEntity *pCaller, USE_TYPE useType, float value )
{
   // USE stuff here
}

The player.cpp function CBasePlayer::PlayerUse() will check that the player is close enough to the entity (within PLAYER_SEARCH_RADIUS uints) and that the entity's ObjectCaps() function returns FCAP_IMPULSE_USE, FCAP_CONTINUOUS_USE or FCAP_ONOFF_USE)

That's about all you have to do to be able to use an entity.
