Ok, i have to bot working in another mod, well almost, it doesn't crash and I can join the side, but when I spawn, I am placed in the wrong place and can't move due to that i am placed in the ground. I dunno what I changed but maybe it has to do with the bot not joining a team?

I probably don't have the teams defined right, but i am puzzled to my spawn problem.

are you sure you pass the entities off that mod? Since i had this too in FLF. I got the bots spawning, but when i spawned, i just got in the middle of nowhere. Since some mods use their own spawn entities, you need to pass them through too! 

look in file linkfunc.cpp

Thanks Stefan. I got myself to spawn in the correct places. Now I just need to get the Bot to join the team correctly.
