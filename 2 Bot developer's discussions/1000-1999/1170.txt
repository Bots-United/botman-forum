Ok, its a bit of a dumb question, because I have a fealing its a really simple command, but any way.
How do I get the host (server I'm currently connected to) address???
because I want to be able to check if a command is comming from the server admin or not (i.e. addbot)

Cheers for ya help

you can hilight the server and click 'Game Info' or whatever that is, i'm not sure how to get it through console though.

Hi,

For a listen server, INDEXENT(1) is the host entity. He also also connects with the address of "loopback".
