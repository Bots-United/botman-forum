Subject: The stupid bug where it crashes when a bot joins

Well my bots don't really crash much when they join, but if they are put into the 'unassigned' list when they join, and then they choose a team, the HL engine will crash. I think you were trying to fix this problem by delaying the actuall adding of bots, Botman, but the crash doesn't occur when the bots connect - it occurs when they join a team... now the bots will also crash when autoteambalance is used because of this I think :(  Even after I converted to template 3 which I thought would fix some of the joining bugs... I may just go back to template 1! I don't think it had as many problems :(

And also when I used 'sv_restartround' in CS, it ends the whole game, brings up the scores and moves onto the next map! Usually it would just restart the game on the current map - I think this is also a template 2/3 problem, as NNBot for example doesn't do that... I have experimented a little with delays on joining teams, but I don't know as much about the HL engine as you Botman - is there no way you can improve the joining code?

The bots can all join in less than a second if they are assigned correctly to teams, but if they are 'unassigned' then try to connect it usually crashes - I kind of fixed that by making the bots choose option '5' instead of '1' or '2' if the user doesn't specify a team when using 'addbot', so that they won't try to join a team that is full, but I hate having to do stuff like that - I would prefer that the joining code was corrected. I know that this is not a problem with my bots as I just converted to a new template so all the joining code will be exactly the same as in the template :(

Have any other bot authors managed to fix this? I noticed the PODbot joining code seemed very stable... and NNBot is also very good, but only has a maximum of 20 bots I think...

Well I only put the bots in manually not through a bot.cfg file. So I don't get any problems. And I tried your bot and your right about the crash :( I had to reset my whole computer :((. I'm also trying to get a delay, before they join. So far nothing yet maybe it has to do with the reading from the file, when it reads from a file and spots a addbot command it right away adds one to the game maybe it's that, but I think i'm wrong :)

No it works from the file, just manually tends to have more crashes.

Also my bot STILL crashes after 20 mins, even when I basically re-did it from scratch! Since it crashes after 20/30 mins on my computer but other users who have tried my bot get crashes very quickly, my dad thinks that memory is getting wasted (I have 256mb of memory on my PC), so is there anywhere in the template that might be taking up memory without releasing it? I don't think there is anything in my code that will do that, I have just been doing normal stuff with normal variables, not assigning RAM or whatever... this is going to be a real problem - some people like my bots but they are getting crashes!!!!!!! =( =( =(

HAs anyone else had problems where the bots crash after 20 mins? I think it might be a problem with template 2... so I may just revert back to template 1 if I can't solve this problem =(     Maybe it is to do with the chat code or something??

There are no memory leaks in the HPB bot template #3 code as far as I am aware.

Perhaps the simplest way to eliminate the template code as the source of your problems is to build the template code (unmodified) and create bots in Counter-Strike with it.  Even though they don't buy weapons, just play for however long you have been playing on your computer and see if you get the same types of crashes.

It would help if you set up Dr.Watson to intercept crashes and create a log file of this.  You could then send me the Dr.Watson log and I could look to see what area in the template the crashes are occuring (if they are actually in the template code).

Well the problem is that using the basic template the bots won't find each other at all, they will just stand still, but when I start adding in code to make them find each other I could be introducing bugs... I just don't know if it is my own code or the template, but I have checked my code thoroughly I'm pretty sure there's no NULL pointers being accessed, etc, and it would seem to be some sort of memory problem, as it takes ages to crash on my 256mb machine... well I'll maybe try that Dr Watson thing (if I have it...)

Okay, here's what I tried...

1. Download the HPB bot template version #3 source code from fileplanet.com

2. Build HPB_bot.dll from the unmodified template code using Microsoft Visual C++.

3. Copy HPB_bot.dll to cstrike\dlls folder.

4. Change cstrike\liblist.gam to use HPB_bot.dll instead of mp.dll.

5. Edit mapcycle.txt to only include cs_assault.

6. Create a cstrike\bot.cfg file with the following lines...

pause 3
addbot
addbot
addbot
addbot
addbot
addbot

7. Make sure there are NO .wpt files in the cstrike\maps folder.

8. Start an 8 player listen server using cs_assault with 5 minute rounds.

...2 of the six bots were unassigned in the first round (that's okay, they joined the game after the 2nd or 3rd round).  I played for 20 minutes and got maybe 5 or 10 kills.  The bots don't just stand there, they randomly wander around and eventually kill you or another bot.

I let this setup run for 12 hours straight.  There were no crashes and no memory leaks (memory usage hadn't changed at the end of 12 hours from what it was a few minutes after the server was started).

I suggest you do the same to convince yourself that there isn't any problem with the HPB bot template #3 source code.  If you build the unmodified template had you still have crashing problems then you may have to re-install Half-Life (and the MODs) or re-install Windows, Half-Life (and MODs).

Okay thanks for the test Botman - I also did my own test.. I let NNBot run for an hour or two and it had frozen when I came back, so it's probably a problem with my computer... sorry to bother you with that :(         Well at least I know my code is fine, so I can stop worrying about that :D

Alistair, you don't have your computer overclocked, have you? I had similar problems as you (freezing after some time) and it turned out to be a problem of overclocked CPU/graphics card.

Nah - it had some heat problems at first (the heatsink wasn't connected properly, stupic mail order comapny...) and it still hasn't had thermal grease put on it yet... but it usually locks the whole thing up and not just one program
