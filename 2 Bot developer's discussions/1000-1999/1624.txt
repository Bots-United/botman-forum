Guys,

I've been developing a bot that depends on a Windows authoring tool for the AI.  Basically, you write the AI using the graphical tool, and then an AI engine makes whatever you wrote operational.
The only thing it does that is advanced, is that you can have the bots "listen" to you; i.e., when you say jump, they jump.  And if you tell them to come to you, they will.  But these are just examples of what has been authored during trial testing, and not near what is possible with the tool.  It's up to the individual coder.
It works for TFC right now.  All future work will be for CS.
You can download the manual or application at

I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried it.  If you author something that you think is cool, please send it to me-- I'll include it in the next release.
This work was sponsored in part by the Air Force, who wants a tool to quickly modify/synthesize the AI in simulations.

I've downloaded this and it looks pretty cool.

You basically have a GUI tool to design a state machine for each of the "control functions" for a bot (like navigation, combat, team play, chatting, etc.)  You create states and transitions from one state to the next based on what you want the bot to do in certain situations (like run toward the enemy, stop, turn left, turn right, jump, fire, find a waypoint, etc.).

The state machines for the bot can be as complex or as simple as you'd like them to be.  You can create different state machines for different types of bot behaviour (gung-ho bots, sneaky bots, scaredy bots, etc.).  Then assign a behaviour to the bot when you create them.

I would hate to think what the state machine would look like for the current HPB bot ;), but for somebody that doesn't want to learn C++ to write a bot this could be a very useful tool.
