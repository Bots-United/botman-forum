I've just started work on a bot for my favourite mod - S&I

When I try to create a LAN game I get the following error:

  Debug Assertion Failed!

  Program D:\GAMES\HL\HL.EXE
  File: fopen.c
  Line: 54

  Expression: *file != _T('\0')

I can choose to ignore it (it appears 4 times) - but when the game starts none of the mod-specific entities are present!

The only change to the HPB_Bot template I've made is to add an SI_DLL define and the code to choose the correct mod dll (si.dll)

Please Help!

There's a function in util.cpp that determines which directory to use for .txt and .cfg files.  Look for the UTIL_BuildFileName() function and add the directory for the MOD you are trying to support by copying and modifying one of the currently supported MODs in this function.
