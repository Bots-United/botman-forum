Hi,

I'm having some trouble getting them to turn around when my bot is getting shot. I'm doing a bot for Action half-life if you didn't know :) But about the problem I can't get them to turn around because the server doesn't return the damage message when he is being shot. (Snippet of bot_client.cpp): code:


void BotClient_Valve_Damage(void *p, int bot_index)
{
   static int state = 0;   // current state machine state
   static int damage_armor;
   static int damage_taken;
   static int damage_bits;  // type of damage being done
   static Vector damage_origin;

   if (state == 0)
   {
      state++;
      damage_armor = *(int *)p;
   }
   else if (state == 1)
   {
      state++;
      damage_taken = *(int *)p;
   }
   else if (state == 2)
   {
      state++;
      damage_bits = *(int *)p;
   }
   else if (state == 3)
   {
      state++;
      damage_origin.x = *(float *)p;
   }
   else if (state == 4)
   {
      state++;
      damage_origin.y = *(float *)p;
   }
   else if (state == 5)
   {
      state = 0;

      damage_origin.z = *(float *)p;

      if ((damage_armor > 0) || (damage_taken > 0))
      {
         // ignore certain types of damage...
         if (damage_bits & IGNORE_DAMAGE)
            return;

         // if the bot doesn't have an enemy and someone is shooting at it then
         // turn in the attacker's direction...
         if (bots[bot_index].pBotEnemy == NULL)
         {
            // face the attacker...
            Vector v_enemy = damage_origin - bots[bot_index].pEdict->v.origin;
            Vector bot_angles = UTIL_VecToAngles( v_enemy );

            bots[bot_index].pEdict->v.ideal_yaw = bot_angles.y;

            BotFixIdealYaw(bots[bot_index].pEdict);

            // stop using health or HEV stations...
            bots[bot_index].b_use_health_station = FALSE;
            bots[bot_index].b_use_HEV_station = FALSE;
            bots[bot_index].b_use_capture = FALSE;
         }
      }
   }
}



This doesn't work, because the engine never sends a message damage to the server. Very annoying. Anyone got any idea to get them to turn around to the attacker???

Any help will be appreciated.

Are you setting up engine.cpp functions to catch this network message (like so)...
code:
   else if (mod_id == AHL_DLL)
   {
      if (msg_type == message_Damage)
         botMsgFunction = BotClient_AHL_Damage;
   }

Yes I did that. I think that action half-life uses another way to give people damage.

Maybe you have forgotten to initialize the message_Damage variable? If I remember right there is a collection of if-statements somewhere that sets up all message codes for every supported MOD. Have you extended that part for FA?
If you want to be sure you could check if damage messages get sent by using the debug_engine option...

Yes I did that too. I debugged it over and over again, but can't find a damage message send :(.
