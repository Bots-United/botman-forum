Does anyone know how i could mess with health, armor or ammo with the hpb_bot?  I just wanted to tinker with it and maybe include a cheating mode for the ABot.  I'll appreciate any help (thanks again botman).

Just modify the pev->health or pev->armor for any player-entity (bot or not) as you like. If you want to change your own values it would be the easiest thing to add a new clientcommand (in dll.cpp).

In the BotThink() function, just set...

pEdict->v.health = 100;
pEdict->v.armor = 100;

...to keep resetting the health and armor to 100.  It won't make them invincible (you can still kill them if you do enough damage all at once, like a grenade or rocket blast), but it will make them LOTS harder to kill with bullets.  ;D

Well, what if i wanted to change the health of player.netname "xHAHAx" to 100, armor to 100 and have it as a console command.  how would i search for an entity matching the .netname (in lower-case) of arg1 passed by ClientCommand() in dll.cpp.

I.E. in the console:
mega xHAHAx 100 100
cmd  nick   hval aval

cmd  = command
nick = nickname (netname)
hval = health value
aval = armor value

help is appreciated.  thanks again botman/tobias :)
