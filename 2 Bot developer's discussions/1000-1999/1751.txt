I've figured out how to play HUD sounds, but I would like to play sounds the way footsteps are played e.g. as if the bot is making the sound.

How do I accomplish this?

Sounds (like footsteps, gun fire, explosions) are usually handled client-side (at least they are for CS and TFC).  When writing Half-Life bot code, you don't have access to any of the code that runs on the client.  You will have to "fake" most of the sound stuff by catching other network messages on the server or by scanning through all the players on the server to see what they are currently doing (i.e. running, shooting, etc.).

Search this forum for discussions about "sounds" to see some of the previously discussed methods of handling this.
