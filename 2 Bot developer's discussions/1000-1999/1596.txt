Ok ... Is it possible to make a bot sign into a server through the server just as the client does? If so what predictions do you have on what would happen to the lag? (when I say sign onto a server the way a client does I mean with all of the same ptr and util messages and every thing down to the T...)

The engine command pfnCreateFakeClient() is used to create a bot on the server.  There isn't any "signing in".  Real clients go through the same sort of thing when they connect (in addition to other stuff like exchanging decals, downloading maps, etc).  The biggest difference is that bots don't have a network connection so the engine can not send network messages to these entities.  That's what the FL_FAKECLIENT flag is for, to prevent the engine from trying to send a network message to a client that doesn't have a network connection.

The lag that is displayed in the scores is purely fake.  I suspect that there's code similar to this somewhere in the engine where lag is calculated...
code:
// calculate the lag for this player...
lag = calc_lag(player);
 
if (lag < 5)
   lag = 5;  // handle lag for fake clients

The only way to get a bot to have more than a lag of 5 is to create the bot on the client and not on the server.
