This param is set by TraceLine() functions.
What does it really mean?

this represents the relative position of the point where the line is fract. i.e. if u multiply this value with the distance of both points u gave to the function, u'll get the distance from the first point to the point where the line hits something

I tried downloading the clienthook.zip and generic_clientdll_hook.zip from your website, but both of those zip files won't unzip with WinZip 7.0 or ZipFolders.  I tried to download them from the mirror but it says I don't have permission to access that file.

Do you need any special version of WinZip to handle those .zip files (or are they corrupt on the web page)?

I use console 7zip with Far (I hate GUI and I think the Winzip has the most stupid interface I've ever seen), so I won't use it. 

I recommend to use WinRAR (www.rarsoft.com), it can also unpack ZIP archives correctly (BTW, also TAR, GZ, UUE etc). At least, it unpacks these archives correctly.

I repacked and uploaded the archives on the RAR format.
