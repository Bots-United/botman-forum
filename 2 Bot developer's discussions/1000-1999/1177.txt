Hmm... Just because everyone needs the same client.dll, botman presumes you can't create client side bots.

I don't know what botman does all day, but creating client side bots would relieve server lag(transfering it to the client)

You could still use the dll loader system. The only catch would be that everyone would have to have the bot client.dll, which is no problem, as everyone would know that that server could have bots on....

Hmm... Maybe botman is a bot with a serious bug?

I'm interested in the possibilities of doing client side AI (though your "constructive" tone puts me off a little).

Do you have any factual evidence you can really implement AI at the client side? I would expect the client to receive solely the facts about the game world that are in view (PVS) and hearable (PHS) of the client. In other words, if the client side bot moves outside the surroundings visibile to the player, he will not see any other entities.
[note to self: joke about somebody other than botman being blind would do well here]

p.s. I'm interested in this because it would scale to large amounts of AI characters, provided you have the bandwidth (though lag might move, the amount of information that has to go to and come from the server increases if the AI moves away from the server).

Pikachu, how do you imagine  your client side bot will work? If you want to get rid of the lags you would need to let the bot run exclusively on the client. That's not possible since it will always send messages of its actions etc to the game server. If it wouldn't do that, other clients wouldn't be able to see the bot that runs on your computer and would just see you fire in the air and do other strange things. That's just one point, I think there are several others that impide you from creating a client side bot...
Just try it out and you'll see what problems you will encounter.

I think what Pikachu was pointing out was that it is (should be) possible to write a replacement client.dll file as long as the server and all clients are using the same client.dll file.  Since the client.dll file normally sends network packets with the keyboard and mouse movements to the server you should be able to create a client DLL that simulates a human player (a bot).

Half-Life requires that the client.dll running on the client matches the client.dll located on the server (even Linux servers MUST have the same client.dll that is found on Win32 machines so that they will have the same CRC32 value).

To be able to create a custom client DLL that is not used on the server (and all the other clients) is, I think, impossible.  If Pikachu or anyone else can prove me wrong and create your own client.dll that gets successfully loaded and allows you to connect to an Internet server that is running a different client.dll I would be very surprised.  I would really like to see how that can be done and I'm sure VALVe would too! ;)

I've sent e-mails back and forth with Yahn.  I like the way Valve does some stuff (I'm not too wild about "forcing" people to use Microsoft Visual C++).  I like the fact that Valve keeps releasing patches and bug fixes to the Half-Life engine even though it is "outdated" and using technology that is 4 or 5 years old (Quake/Quake II).  I like the fact that the developers at Valve take the time to respond to e-mail messages and I like the fact that Valve employees participate in various e-mail lists.

Many people feel like Valve only caters to the Counter-Strike team.  I know for a fact that this is not true.  Valve will help out anyone that asks them, but you've got to be willing to do the ground work yourself.  Valve will NOT teach you how to write programs in C++.  Valve will NOT teach you how to use a model editor or a level editor.  Valve will NOT teach you how to create a teamplay MOD using the VGUI interface.  Valve will explain things like "How do you change the color of the blood sprites?", or "How do I remove decals at the end of a round in a round based game?", etc.

Valve has done surprisingly well for a company that started with a few guys from Microsoft.  The very first game they released went gold and was voted game of the year by more than 40 companies in 1999 (something Valve likes to point out fairly often).  Not many other companies have done something like this.  I can only think of 2 companies that I like as much as Valve, 3d Realms (Duke Nukem 3D) and iD Software (Quake).

Is Valve my buddy or something?  Yes, they are!  :D

Thx for the replies....


Well, the only way to fake the CRC32 value of the client is to hack the data sent to the server, or :

If the CRC32 check is in the engine, make a version of the engine that fakes the crc check.

Oh, i forgot to say :

You could make a seperate server run beside the half-life server, which accepts incomming client connections from a bot client...

You could then create a fake client on the server and make the bot client update the psition, etc.
