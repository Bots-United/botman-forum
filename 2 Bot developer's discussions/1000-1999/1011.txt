do I get information about the clip sizes of every weapon at the start of a game ??  ... 'cause it's not in weapon_defs, or do I have to do it another way ?

In the weapon list messages one of the bytes is a "maxammo" field.  This is the maximum ammount of ammo you can carry, but there isn't anything that indicates what the size of clip is.  This is usually hard-coded into the server and client .dll files.

You will have to create your own table with the clip size for each weapon.  You could use the weapon ID as the index into this array.
