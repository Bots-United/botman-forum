If you are playing team fortress use mp_teamplay instead of mp_freindlyfire...


see the team fortress server manual (html page) for more details.... You can find the page you're looking for here...

If you want the bots to shoot at teammates in addition to players on the other team, you will need to change the code in BotFindEnemy() to remove the check for targeting teammates.

You may want to just make it target teammates 10% of the time randomly.  Use something like...

if (RANDOM_LONG(100) <= 90)
{
   // don't target your enemies...
   if ((bot_team != player_team) &&
      !(team_allies[bot_team] & (1<<player_team)))
      continue;
}

...this will only check for teammates 90% of the time, the rest of the time it will skip over the check for teammates and target any players that it sees.

one disadvantage botman, using that code, the bots will 'lock on target'. So they will kill the 'enemy' (friend!). If you only want to let the bots shoot for once or something, then you should have some code to check if the pBotEnemy team is not the current team.
