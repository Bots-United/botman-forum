I have been working on a DOD bot for a few days and decided to take a break from it... so I started a Gunman Chronicles Bot. I got the bots to join and they run around as usual, but they don't shoot. Any ideas?

Make sure they have a weapon

Make sure the IN_ATTACK button is being pressed(on the bot)

Make sure the bot knows its got a weapon

Make sure you've got all the exports from the gunman dll

Make sure the bot knows what the weapons are

 :-)

They have a weapon.

I've got all the exports (and then some!).

The other parts I'm not so sure about. I included entries for the weapons like in the other MODs, but these weapons are by far different than in any MOD I've seen. Each of the weapons has its own custom settings. For example, while a certain gun is in use, typing cust_11 at the console will tweak only that weapon (offscreen). Customizations include how many shells, bullet spread, (for bombs) timing, payload, etc. I haven't mapped out all of the cust_'s for all of the weapons yet. I was wondering if I should include the cust_xx as a weapon that can be directly selectable (i.e. give the bot a "choice" of customization depending on what gun it has selected) a percentage of the time if available? It would use the FAKE_CLIENT_COMMAND(...cust_xx...) to choose its weapon I guess. Any ideas?
