Ok, im about to try the impossible, making a hl client side bot :P

I could really need som help on this, so if anyone can dig up any info on previous clientsidebots for other games, then post it here 

Botman, i hope youve got some guidance here, what would be the smartest way to start ?

first of all i'll just try to make it for hl dm, making it spawn into the game should be hard as hell.....then maybe port it over to other mods after a while..

the only way to do it is to have the same software of the bot on the server machine

Have you already searched the forum for client side bots? Botman had posted some links and suggestions how to start in another thread on the topic. It was something like:
1) Have a look at the Q2-network-protocol (there are open-source client-side bots for Quake available on the net)
2) Botman has written an utility program for logging the network messages - should be found under download
3) Good luck because many tried it and none succeded and yes, hacking experience will be of advantage

hi.

i reverse engineered the halflife netcode some time ago. but when it came to the point where i had to write all that stuff like rendering and mod support, i had a lack of time and i freezed the project. but i got that far that i could connect to a server, and say something. i didn't work all the time cuz my code wasn't very solid.

its a lot of work, u need a solid code and a lot of time. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE, and if u need any help, just ask.

first of all i'd try to write a own small client clone.

if you need further info, contact me.

and good luck, hf, and Ganbate Kudasai !

no. you thinking of a seperate dll.
but i think Jørgen is thinks of a self made client file. That would allow you to let the computer perfectly imitate a player. this can be cool, but dangerous. it would allow cheating in a new dimension. im speaking of REAL aimbots, that see through walls, perfekt wallhacks that kill all world faces that are orthogonal to floor, and all that funny stuff. everything that is not server sided could be changed to the cheaters pleasure.

so please, Jørgen, if you succed, do NOT make your client opensource. it would be the death for all games based on the halflife engine.
you could for example make the bot an external dll, and make it open source.

Hmm that would be weird a client side bot that had no reaction time and knew EXACTLY where every enemy was and wouldn't react to FBs, etc :)     They probably made it hard to make a client side bot on purpose... I think that it is a pretty bad idea. Someone could reverse engineer the DLL or something and make a really sucky aimbot type thing :(

That would REALLY suck! But at least you would know fairly quickly and you could boot the person, or maybe punkbuster would help...

yeah exactly.
you could also do a little radar thingie, while playing cs in window mode u have a small additional window with nme radar and some nasty stuff.
punkpuster would help to specific point but i can only detect cheats it knows, and if client is open source, you could easily change it so punky wont detect it anymore.

another thing to add:

actually no. i know one of the valve guys, and he told me that they were actually happy to have the netcode work the way it was intended to. they don't have any special security , except the common encryption of the movement data, which can easily be reverse engineered. and its not very optimized, and VERY similiar to the quakeworld netcode (which actually IS open source).
