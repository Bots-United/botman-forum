Does anyone the code behind how an item_tfgoal attaches to a player and takes on their animations? And the code behind it returning to its original location (i.e deattach). I have tried mailing VALVe but with no reply.

thanks,

Since the source code for Team Fortress or any mod like it was never released for the public, I doubt anyone knows ! If any one has any idea, thats a different story :-) Is it for a MOD that you're making I take it?

I don't know if this will help or not, but you can take a look at the TF 2.5 source code (for Quake) to see if item_tfgoal is defined in it or not.  I've got a mirror of the TF 2.5 source code here...
