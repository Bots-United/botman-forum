I've downloaded the blitzbot source just to mess with it a little. But I want to use my VC++ 6 instead of mingw32 to compile it, so i took your HPB bot code with the workspace and just copied and pasted over all your code with his. But when I compile it there is a linking error:

unresolved external symbol "void_cdecl BotStartGame(struct bot_t *)" (?botstartgame@@yaxpaubot_t@@@z)

what the hell does that mean.
I think its got something to do with the botstartgame in the bot.cpp file please help

Make sure there is a BotStartGame() function defined in one of the .cpp files.  Also make sure that you are passing the correct parameters to this function in all of the places that you are calling it from.  Since C++ allows you to overload functions with different parameters, you may have it defined in one module, but you may be calling it with the wrong arguments in another module.
