This has to be the best modification I've ever played.

Anyone for the idea of making a bot for The Opera.


Thanks

you already have mooks in there... so no need for a bot!

Yes, but the mooks don't work on all the maps.

Does anyone else think that some of the textures used in the Opera look "washed out"?  It is just me (or my monitor) that makes things look so pale?

HaHaHa! Redu!

I wish I can play The Opera online.

Ever since I got this new patch, I'm getting this Invalid Authentication Information crap.

They are still not responing with a definate answer.

I can't join ANY of the The Opera servers now. :(
