Is it possible to obtain a string that the user has typed from outside of the console? What I am trying to do is this: The user is presented with a menu. Some of the menu choices require more (non-numeric) information. For example, one menu choice is to load a file, but I also need the client to type the name of the file to load. I would like for something to happen like when the user enters messagemode and "say: " appears at the top of the screen and lets them type in their message, except mine would be like "Load file: " and then my code would grab the filename.

I realize that I could implement it from the console by catching a "loadfile myfile.dat" command, but this is not really an optimal solution for my purposes. Does anybody have any ideas? Thanks!

send a command to the clients console saying "messagemode loadfile" that should do it...

All of the code handling the "say" command is embedded in the client.dll.  If you want to create your own client.dll then you could copy and modify this code and create your own method of input.

You can't do this if you are adding a bot to an existing MOD since if you create your own client, the player won't be able to join Internet servers.
