I am still having this problem.
I set the fakeclient property for the bot, however  it still sends messages to it?

It says something like "Error : MSG:ONE with no target entity." and crashes.

According to ReDucTor, it crashes at the "clientsetinfo()" stuff, could this be the problem?

I am making a bot for 1.0.1.6 mods.

Are you talking about CS? If so, set the fakeclient-flag *every time* after you call pfnRunPlayerMove. That should fix it.

Yep, but you should do it two times every think: at the beginning to have it set for the things you do within botThink() and at the end after runPlayerMove() to have it set for the code in startFrame() and other methods... It worked this way for me, maybe you've got other problems additionaly? If you think it's the fakeclient-flag add lines like the following in various places of your code:
if (!(pev->flags & FAKECLIENT)) ALERT( at_console, "FC not set\n" );
You will trace the error that way.
