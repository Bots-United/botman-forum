Using your 'bomb planting tutuorial' I added in support for my bots planting the bomb last night =)   Then using the info I gained when doing the bomb planting stuff I got the bots to use hostages inteligently (recording the edict of the bot so that it will not use it again, and no other bot will use it)!     Today I'm going to do the defusing stuff, that should be pretty similar to the bombplanting. THANKS DARKYOUTH AND BOTMAN!!! My bot went from being deathmatch to being able to almost complete the missions in one single 5 hour (midnight - 5am) coding session :)     Now if I just check to see what's going wrong with my new RouteFinding system then the bots will be able to rescue hostages!

And also the new RouteFinding system will enable the bot to do the TFC/FLF missions properly, as it recognises team specific goals/returns, so I'm pretty chuffed with the way my bot is going at the moment :)   Maybe I'll stop playing the PlayStation for a few days and concentrate on my bot =D

Hehe I've got the defusing going too :)      I remembered a topic about telling the difference between smoke grenades and c4, so I got the entity name from that (actually a post made by CF, lol =) ). I know it's sort of just cut'n'paste, but I still feel proud of my bots now that they're growing up :)

Now all I need is a 'Get the bots to act exactly like humans' tutorial ;)

Just go to the 'search' thing at the top, and type i 'bomb', then somewhere in the first 2 pages of results u should see the tutorial :)     There were other ones too, but I can't remember what they were, and I don't think I needed them...
