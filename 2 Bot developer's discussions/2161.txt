Hi,

I was just wondering is there a Gunman Chronicles bot??
I liked the single player game but playing multiplayer will give me a high foon bill :/

I don't think there is a bot for Gunman Chronicles.

Ummmm, well I got it for free when I purchased Blue Shift (from CompUSA), played a few of the levels but never finished it.  I didn't think it was all that great.

I tried for a little while to do it, but it would crash on me quite often.  I have not tried to work on it since, but would be willing to help if someone is willing to take it on.
