Just a quicky, I was wondering if anybody has solved the problem of bots getting stuck with oneanother yet? The tread that was started on this topic seems to have died down now, But Im guessing we've got bored of that problem. Can anybody say if it is solved?

Also, (As a thought) at roughly which patch released did this problem arrise? (Im wondering if it is network code)

The problem is unsolvable. Simple as that.

In my own experience I always saw it, even before the release of the SDK 2, when I tried botman's first bots in TFC and Counter-Strike.

The msec delay can't be calculated accurately enough to prevent the movement of a RunPlayerMove to last the little too short or the little too long that makes it collide with another player. I still can't tell why players are not affected (I know this is not the same method, but) anyway, unless you have full prediction on your source code and you are able to tell exactly what you will be doing in the next frame and HOW LONG IT WILL LAST. Impossible.

I've tried 4 methods for calculating the msec value. Killaruna's method (Tobias / Parabot) seems like the most efficient, but I can't tell because it seems to depend on the map (r_speeds), on the model (skin) of the bot (the yoda skin is not very affected, btw ! maybe it's the size...) and many other things. TheFatal's method works well, also, no offense but your method doesn't work that well with me, because I've got frames that last much longer than the others (when my bots scan their FOV for example), and that makes all the difference. I believe it would work well for a bot that would deliver a "constant" framerate, though...

Final word, until Valve completely changes the method of working of RunPlayerMove -and then releases a new SDK, let's dream- the bots will get stuck.
