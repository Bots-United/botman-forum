Is there any way I can give players some set of "default" equipment?

like terrorists spawning with the usp and so on.

Maybe I've got it wrong, but why make the bots start with something not defaulted already, ie cheating.

You could spawn a weapon directly above them, it would drop down onto them and they would then have it.  Sort of like the "give" cheat in Half-Life deathmatch.  See my Stripper2 plugin for metamod as an example of how to do this sort of thing.

Im thinking about using it for a serverside plugin, not the bots :P

Simple. When a round starts you just simply create what you want at the position of every player!

There are ways of spawning entities yourself, see some posts about.
