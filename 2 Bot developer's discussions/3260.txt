How can i get a bot to stand still at a waypoint, and when a player comes within a certain distance, have hime run to the next waypoint and then repeat this untill the waypoints run out?

You need some kind of node selection code, be it random node within range or a path finding algo. If you aren't sure how to do this, ask yourself if AI is a good place to start learning C.

Of course it is !
That's just what I did and how I learned C.
