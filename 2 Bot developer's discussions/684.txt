Has anybody a working botcam function (like the CS-observer cam)? I modified the code from the CBasePlayer::startDeathCam() but it doesn't work well: You can change the camera view as you like (although I'm setting the correct angle each frame) and your weapon is still visible :-(
Another question concerns the instance()-function to obtain a CBasePlayer-object from an edict_t: I tried to change some variables in the object but it seems as if the new values aren't stored... Maybe you just get a temporary object for reading values? Has anybody encountered similar problems?

Not really a Botcam, but I tried to let a Bot control my player. I tried to do this by clearing the FL_CLIENT and setting the FL_FAKECLIENT in flags and spawnflags. But it didn't work for me (the Bot tried to steer and I could control the player as well).
