Hi y'all,

Compared to any 1.0.x.x version of the HL SDK, how does the FVisible differ in the 1.1.0.x SDK?

I'm trying to detect if a player is visible to the bot, but FVisible never returns a TRUE value.

How come?

My code looks something like

if( FVisible( pEnemy ))
{
  // Initiate search and destroy
}

Best regards,

It works exactly the same as far as I can tell.  You pass in the entity that you want to see if it is visible (i.e. can trace a line from the player all the way to the entity).

Hmm.. Ok.. Guess I'm making something wrong then. I'll go over it once more.

Thanx,
