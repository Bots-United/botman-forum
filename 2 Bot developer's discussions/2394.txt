Just 4 quick questions:

1. Is it possible to change code on the fly using VC++ and have it take affect while the game is running?

2. Can someone give me an example of how to change the custom build so that the output dll file is copied to another directory.

3. Is there a command line for half-life to load straight into a lan game with me playing, rather than having to go through all the menu's to set one up?

4. Can anyone explain the UTIL_ShowMenu() parameters as I'm having problems adding more items to the waypoint menu. I think slots uses some sort of bit method but I'm not sure. Also are the maximum number of items on 1 menu limited to 5 or something?

Thanks.

ad 1:
yes, the MSVC 'edit-and-continue' feature ... but it works only for a debug build, it cannot deal with all kinds of changes, and MSVC gets unstable after a couple of edit-and-continues.

3. In the command line use this line:
c:\half-life\hl.exe -game <mod> +deathmatch 1 +maxplayers 16 +map <map> -dev -sw

-sw = windowed
-dev = developer mode

And the rest is not hard to understand :).

+maxplayers = mp


you can also do patching to change code on a fly(its fun...lots of fun)

adding a +sv_lan 1 into that line is a good idea as well..
