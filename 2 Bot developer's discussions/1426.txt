Hi all, any idea why when accessing a v. variable from the edict_t of an entity can cause an access violation sometimes?  For example, if I store the v.origin of an entity in my bot_t structure and go to access it with something like  if (pBot->entity != NULL) entity_origin = pBot->entity->v.origin; most of the time it works, but after a changelevel and i go to increase the max_bots, i get an access violation on that code.  sometimes it happens right away, sometimes it doesn't happen for a while, but it eventually happens.  this is very frustrating because as long as the entity exists (passes the null condition statement, there should be an v.origin, right?!  argh.  any ideas? TIA
using visual c++ and debugger)

You might try to set your entity to NULL if there is a changelevel.
Maybe that helps.

Don't save any player's edict structure. They can disappear if the user disconnects or as you say level change. Clear them out whenever you believe it may be wiped by the engine (do test for any problem you encounter ;)

Hi guys, thanx for the replies.  I've done all that, and it's not a matter of changelevel anymore, this actually happens once and a while when the server is first run.  Also, it's not at any particular time, the entities im refering to are entities that exist on the map (flag, buttons, keycards, etc) so it's not a matter of them leaving like a player slot.  I'm NOW getting the access violations inside the Vector structure too, which isn't even my code.  Something is very funky here.  Also, it happens at arbitrary times.  Here's another strange one, I solved the original problem I had of changing the max_bots after a level change and traced it to autoteam being set to one in my server.cfg.  With it off, that access violation doesn't occur,but now I'm getting them every so often with waypoint[].origin  ARGH.  Again, all the proper checking is in before trying to get an origin, eg making sure the waypoints are loaded, fall in between 0 and numwaypoints, etc.  But now I get an access violation when trying to just read the waypoint[x].origin.  BTW just let me say that it happens seldomly, but it does happen.  Let me also say, that origin is Vector struct based and I'm suspecting the violation is happening again inside the Vector struct like before.  Silly of me not to have copied the exact line in the vectore struct that the debug engine points to, I'll do that in a followup.  But this brings back the question, why would you get an access violation once and a while, and not ALL the time one an entities .origin or v.origin when the entities are always in the level?

Time to pull out Soft-ICE and kill the mofo.
