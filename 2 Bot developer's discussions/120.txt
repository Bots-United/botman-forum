Botman, have you figured a way to compile the full sdk with mingw32, or have you abandoned it like the client.dll?

It will build, it just crashes during the long train ride at the start of the game.  The error dialog claims a function wasn't exported, but it doesn't tell you which class it was for.

I have not found a way to get debug information from MingW32 included in the DLL so that I can use gdb to track down which function is causing the crash.

If anyone can figure out how to get gdb to load debug symbols from the .o files or from the .dll file that may help to trouble shoot the problem.  But since most people who want to build the Full SDK have Microsoft Visual C++ (or are willing to get it), it doesn't seem to be that big an issue.

Okay, I've determined where the problem is.  It's within the Save/Restore code.  I commented out the stuff in DispatchSave() and DispatchRestore() and the hl.dll build with MingW32 did not crash, of course when the next map gets loaded, nothing gets restored and you loose your train ride (since you're sitting on the ground below it).

At least I know where to look now.  The only changes I made were the same ones required to build the Standard SDK, plus modifying the makefile to include all the modules from the Full SDK.
