I can send you the Alpha 1 source code version if you want.  It didn't have bots shooting at enemies, didn't have any of the waypoint code, didn't have the ClientPutInServer fix for Counter-Strike and had various bugs (aiming bug, respawn bugs, map change crashing bugs).  If you want that version let me know.

I've also got the Alpha 2 version which didn't have any of the waypoint code, has support for bots using weapons, had the ClientPutInServer fix for Counter-Strike, but still had various other bugs (aiming bug, respawn problems, map change crashing, etc.).  If you want this version let me know.

The only other version I've got is the one currently available on my web site, which includes all of the bug fixes to date (except I added the welcome message bug).  You can obviously download that version yourself.

If you want to start from scratch and just don't want to use any of my code, then simply rip out all the stuff in the BotThink() function, rip out all the stuff in the BotStartGame() function, remove the bot_combat.cpp and bot_nagivate.cpp files from the project and you'll be left with only the bot_client.cpp stuff (which you may want to rewrite also).  There's lots of stuff in dll.cpp in StartFrame() that you can remove also.
