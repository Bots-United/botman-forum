Here are some good C++ reference web sites...

I don't think you will actually find a free C or C++ book on-line.  You might also go to a public or university library to find C or C++ books.

Even more help for me, even though this will not give EXPERT skills since that comes of trial and error +experience but enough to get a start.
this one I found great too for clean guys like me to understand what coding and C++ is all about http://www.hull.ac.uk/Hull/CC_Web/docs/cnotes/c3.html

a sub link of Botman's tutorial selection.
I'll check the book store for a C++ for dummies also.

I am a quick learner so I hope I can learn and actually make something.
