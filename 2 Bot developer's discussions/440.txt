Well, I'm working on a Half-Life mod, and I am creating my own bot. I have had a problem for a while, were you could not kick a bot, and after searching through you Bot10 source code and in client.cpp (And finding the answer was not there :) ) I found it in bot.cpp, were you reset the sound entity...

1) Why do we do this?

Next thing, I want the bot to straff instead of turning at walls (If it can :) , but, How do I make the bot straff, I know I need to adjust a variable which gets sent to the engine with the msec val and fordward running and so on, but what values do I use for the straff?

I think you use the default Half - Life running speed (270), a possitive value will make the bot move right (The bot's right that is) and a negative value for left. 

2) Am I right?

yes, you are:

Look at the defination of runplayermove and see the strafe parameter...

NEGATIVE VALUES = STRAFE LEFT
POSITIVE = STRAFE RIGHT;

Damn, I've started putting semi-colons at the end of sentances, help me. I need a debugger;

:)

In my Bot Number X MODs I found that if you kick a bot at the moment that it is creating a footstep sound, you have to keep resetting the sound entity for that bot to keep the footstep sound from looping over and over and over.  So I keep reseting the sound in the BotThink() function if that bot has been kicked from the server.

You may or may not need to do the same thing depending on how you handle kicked bots.  The funny thing is, if you look in ClientDisconnect(), it is SUPPOSED to reset the sound entity in there.  I never did spend much time trying to figure out why ClientDisconnect() didn't do this for me.

Whenever I go out I always am sure to null terminate my sound entities and issue a clientdisconnect(meEntity)

I actually pronouce // when speaking under my breath about relatives...
