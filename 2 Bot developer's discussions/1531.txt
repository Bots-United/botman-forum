thanks, i was wondering because elite says this on his homepage on the features list : "- Counter-Strike (I haven’t added in the 1.1 entities yet but it will work in 1.1)"

I thought there was a post on here a little while ago about what to include for 1.1?? I still don't have HL 1106 either. OK adding the new entities was one of the things I wanted to do before Alpha 5, but I suppose that's not needed then. Sorry to confuse you Jorgen

heh, no problem... :)
I started coding my bot from the beginning again yesterday, as I stumbled on some weird bugs...
So know I'm trying to use some of your code to get my bots to plant the bomb...but they just wont plant it :P

All you have to do is do a FakeClientCommand to select "weapon_c4", then get the bot to hold down fire until it no longer has the c4. Defusing is the same but I just get the bot to hold down use for 11 seconds (takes 10 seconds without the defuse kit, 5 with, I think).

When are all your bots gonna be out? I hear about people making CS bots but don't hear anything about a release or what the bot is called (never even knew the JoeBot author posted here!). I'm especially interested in 'Execution Style's bot, it sounded really advanced when he talked about it!

I could of course just release my bot right now, but it wouldnt be any different from any other bots out now....So my goal is to make it "unique"
Some features not seen before and stuff...but if you really want to test it just ask and i'll give it to you, but no point of releasing "just another bot" to the public....


Ive got some plans on how to implement team strategy play too...I'm thinkin about having goal waypoints, the first goal point you put out gets the "goal1" id, the second gets "goal2"...

and then i'll have it load .cfg files for different tactics (half-life/cstrike/frontbot/tactics/de_nuke/ct/tact1.cfg)

for de_nuke this tactic's .cfg would look something like this

//de_nuke tactic number 1

goal1 = camp
goal2 = shootat
goal3 = aimat

//EOF

heres a graphical display of the tactic itself, on de_nuke

code:






------------------------------------
goal3          goal2             
                  -      goal1     
                        ---        
                                   
                                    
                                    
                          /        
                        /          
                      /            
                    /              
           ---------                
          ct start               
--------- -------------------------



this means that the bot will go into the room. fire at the box and then aim somewhere near goal3
to spot enemies....by using more advanced versions of this script i could get the bots to use real human tactics.....

Lets see what im able to do..

lol ... now i don't post as much as last year, but i read most of the posts here. btw. i think scripted behavior isn't good, emergent behavior is better ...
