Just wandering why botman decided to use C instead of C++ (i.e. classes) for the HPB bot?

Also has anyone bothered to rewrite it in C++?

There's no real need for a Bot class since nothing is going to inherit from it.  My OOP design philosophy is don't make something a class unless something will be derived from it or unless it is derived from something else.  Other OOP developers feel quite different about this.  Some people make a class out of EVERYTHING whether is makes sense to or not.

basically because HALF-LIFE SDK uses old C methods. I find it easier anyway!

Does it really? Do have another look.

Making a class out of everything has an advantage in combination with the MSVC IDE: intellisense autocomplete and the browse info work better than when everything is defined in the global scope/namespace.

(using a mix of C and C++ but preferring the latter)
