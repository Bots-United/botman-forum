It is a pointer to an entvars_t structure.

The entvars_t structure is defined in engine\progdefs.h.

If you aren't sure what a pointer is then you should buy a good book on C programming and read about pointers.

Um, I know it's a pointer to entvars_t, but what is it for?? What is the function of it?

"entvars_t *g_pevLastInflictor;  // Set in combat.cpp.  Used to pass the damage inflictor for death messages.
// Better solution:  Add as parameter to all Killed() functions."

I don't understand the comments..

Thanks

In the Standard SDK, when a player is killed it keeps track of the last player who did the damage.  So if you have 2 people shooting at someone, the attacker that does the damage that leads to the player's death gets credit for the kill.
