All versions of the HPB bot will work with Half-Life version 1.1.0.0 or higher.

(Just realize that there are several bugs in the HPB bot template #1 and template #2 versions that were fixed in template #3.  If you have any weird behaviors with the older template code, you'll have to find those bugs on your own.)
