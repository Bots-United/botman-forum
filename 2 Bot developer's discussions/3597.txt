Is it possible to get bots to change their names after they've picked their class. I want to have bots named by class but class cant be confirmed until bots have selected a class from vgui (after they've joined a game and selected a name). is changing pBot->bot_name enough? or is it impossible....

maybe take a look at other open source bots ?

well, my old joebot did it that way

code:
char *infobuffer;
      int clientIndex;
      
      infobuffer = GET_INFOBUFFER( pEdict );
      clientIndex = ENTINDEX( pEdict );
      
      MakeName(szName,name,bot_skill,d_Manner);
      
      SET_CLIENT_KEY_VALUE( clientIndex, infobuffer, "name", szName );


where MakeName created a name in szName, based on skill, name, ....

thanks. funny u should mention joebot ( i dloaded it about an hour ago)

but now i must ask... whats the best way for bots to pick a name from a list of names for a particular class? for example: sniperbot wants a new name.. looks in sniper.names... there's one...

again you could take a look at the joebot :)

just load the names from a .txt file into an array of strings. then you can use the names from the start to the end, and if you are at the end of the list, go back to 0. This way you won't have double names, and you dont need an additional array for which names are used. Of course you can mix the names after loading, so you don't have the same names each time the first bot joins :D

What about always have a piss-you-off-bot that always tried to change names to some other human player's name and then accuse the human player of being a fag for using the same name. That should piss them off :)
