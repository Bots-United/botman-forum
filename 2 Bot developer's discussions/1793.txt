I have been trying to get bots to drive vehicles in CS and heres the bit so I want the bots to use sidestep insted of turning, cos thats what moves the vehicles. I might actually need a lot of help with this bot! hehe...

code:


while(pBot->b_use_button == TRUE)
      {
            pBot->f_move_speed=pBot->f_max_speed;
            if(pEdict->v.button & IN_LEFT)
            {   
                  pEdict->v.button |= IN_MOVELEFT;
                  pEdict->v.button &= ~IN_MOVERIGHT;
                  pEdict->v.button &= ~IN_RIGHT;
                  pEdict->v.button &= ~IN_LEFT;      
             }                                                 
             if(pEdict->v.button & IN_RIGHT) 
             {
                  pEdict->v.button |= IN_MOVERIGHT;
                  pEdict->v.button &= ~IN_MOVELEFT;
                  pEdict->v.button &= ~IN_LEFT;
                  pEdict->v.button &= ~IN_RIGHT;      
             }
            if(pEdict->v.button &= ~IN_USE)
                  pBot->b_use_button=FALSE;
      }



the thing is that whenever I use while loops sometimes the bot can crash cos it gets stuck in the loop...??? I don't even know if this will work! So any ideas oot there hehhe.. ?

Hi
I don't think that infinite loops crash counter-strike.The bots will just end up doing the same all over again and again and will probably appear to stand in the same place all the time.Your while loop's terminating if-statement never evaluates to True,since you don't make the bot press IN_USE in your while loop.

You shouldn't have loops like this to begin with.  You need to call pfnRunPlayerMove() to get the engine to do anything with the bot.  Then you need to exit the BotThink() function and allow the engine to cycle through it's list of entities and begin preparing the next video frame.

Setting fields in the pBot structure or the pEdict structure does nothing if you don't call pfnRunPlayerMove() and then return to the engine.
