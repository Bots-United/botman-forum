I have selected textures that most closely resemble the original textures on only the map E3m1.  I have them all in a seperate wad file.

But I need a copy of e3m1.map.  I have the bsp, but it's not doing me any good.  Can someone send me (yollin@hotmail.com) e3m1.map, which was successfully converted from e3m1.bsp?  Or can someone send me a bsp to map converter that works?  Mine doesn't for this case.  And QuArK won't allow me to copy the hull over, or do crap to the brushes in a bsp.  Since I can't copy the brushes from Quake's e3m1.bsp to a Half-Life e3m1.map, the worst case scenario is that I'll place each brush by hand and make it look just like the original.  And I hope I don't have to do that, it would be extremely time consuming.

In case the point of this post was lost at the end, I need e3m1.map.

You didn't mention what you were using to convert the .bsp file to .map format.  Did you try winbspc.exe for this?  You can download it from the gladiator bot page (if that's not what you were using before)...

I used bsp2map.exe
Found it using an FTP search.
I'm going to the Gladiator bot page right now.

I got the map converted.  The hull is there, pretty much.  The converter did a good job, as far as converters go.  I'm sure I'll be combing miniature brushes out of my hair long past it's first release.
What I'm doing now is textures.  Using the textures I selected earlier, I am replacing an old quake texture with a new HL one, then painstakingly going through the map and aligning the new textures.  QuArK lets me replace all the textures with a click of a button, that's a wonderful feature.
I am about half way through replacing my third texture, and it seems the most frequently used textures are at the beginning of the list.
This level is a lot bigger than I remember.
