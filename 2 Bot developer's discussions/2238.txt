I guess that subject line really says it all.  I want to know how to find the location of the entity that represents the Bomb site.  Is this something to be accomplished in the FindItem function?  I haven't seen how to do this in Botman's template although I might've missed it.  

Thanks,
Robert

Get it to look for "func_bomb_target"...

also, some mappers used to use info_bomb_target

so you should check on that one too (just in case).
