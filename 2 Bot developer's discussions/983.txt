It's not in the SDK.  It's a new file.  You'll need to install the SDK (version 1.0 for the Fodder Bot).  SDK 1.0 requires Half-Life 1.0.1.6 or earlier.  Unzip the Fodder Bot source zip file into the SourceCode\dlls folder and add the bot.cpp file to the project (if using Microsoft Visual C++) or add bot.o to the makefile (if using MingW32).  Then build the mp.dll file (using "Build->Rebuild All" or "make").  Create your own MOD directory in the Half-Life directory and create a "dlls" folder inside that new directory.  Copy the mp.dll file into this "dlls" folder and create a liblist.gam file in you new MOD directory (just copy the one from the Half-Life\valve directory and modify it).
