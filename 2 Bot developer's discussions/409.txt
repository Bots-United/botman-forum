Hey.
I was wondering since I know there are
pEdict->v.button = IN_FORWARD;
pEdict->v.button = IN_DUCK;
pEdict->v.button = IN_JUMP;
pEdict->v.button = IN_USE;
pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK;
pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK2;
pEdict->v.button = IN_RELOAD;
comands are IN_LEFT & IN_RIGHT aveable?
can you post all the IN_***

One more question 
How to make the bot to hold a button
(egs. Hold IN_DUCK)?

Yep, and some more as well. There is a Header-file with all the constants, so have a look there. I don't remember the name, but you can find it using the "search in files" function of VC, searching for "IN_FORWARD" or any other...

You just have to set the pEdict->v.button every frame. You could define a variable holdDuck and use s.th. like:
pEdict->v.button = 0;
...
if (holdDuck) pEdict->v.button = IN_DUCK;

That's weird, the common\in_buttons.h that I've got only has the following...
code:
#define IN_ATTACK      (1 << 0)
#define IN_JUMP            (1 << 1)
#define IN_DUCK            (1 << 2)
#define IN_FORWARD      (1 << 3)
#define IN_BACK            (1 << 4)
#define IN_USE            (1 << 5)
#define IN_CANCEL      (1 << 6)
#define IN_LEFT            (1 << 7)
#define IN_RIGHT      (1 << 8)
#define IN_MOVELEFT      (1 << 9)
#define IN_MOVERIGHT (1 << 10)
#define IN_ATTACK2      (1 << 11)
#define IN_RUN      (1 << 12)
#define IN_RELOAD      (1 << 13)
#define IN_ALT1            (1 << 14)
#define IN_SCORE      (1 << 15)   // Used by client.dll for when scoreboard is held down


What header file did you find these others in?

I first went in the in_buttons.h and got some but i found the rest of them in input.cpp around line 859...

Oh, okay.  But those aren't button values, those are internal client.dll functions.  You won't be able to set the v.button field to those values.
