My wasteland bot now fires, spawns, roams, uses weapons, and kicks my ass, so i'm going to fix some bugs up, write a text, and give them names and hopefully release it by tonight... there is no word where i'll be hosted yet, stay tuned!

Dammit
Can you send me your old source code maybe if you still have it. I suck at bot programing(i havnt even got mine to spawn yet). The one where the bot just spawns into the game and sits there.
Oh and welldone for making the first wasteland bot
(I think)
PS (could you maybe send me your bot(finished) thanks)
