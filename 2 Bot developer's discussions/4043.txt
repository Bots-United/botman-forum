Hey everybody,

How do i add parachutes to the HPB_Bot template for DoD or Firearms? If somebody has some code i could use that would great.

I wouldn't think that parachutes would be anything very special.  I haven't played DoD or Firearms with parachutes, but I would imagine that they are just using the directional keys (ASWD, UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, etc.) to steer the player in the direction they want to go.  The pfnRunPlayerMove() command would be used for this the same way the bots move themselves on land or in the water.

The only tricky part would be detecting when the parachute mode was enabled and disabled (the player landed).  I would imagine a network message would be sent to the client when the parachute mode was activated and another network message was sent to the player when the parachute mode was deactivated.

how would i make the bot realize he's in the air? maybe make a new waypoint type like waypoint pullshute?

Like botman said you could check the network messages or there could also be a change in the entity flags or movetype (like setting movetype = MOVETYPE_FLY). I'd guess you could also do a onetime check if the Bot is right in the air when being spawned. Lots of possibilities actually.
