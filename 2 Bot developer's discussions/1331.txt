The forum seems very quiet lately.  Sorry I haven't had many posts lately, but work is taking its toll.  

Would you bot developers object to listing your bot's name and project status just so we all know who's who and what's what in our little world?  I get the impression there are a lot of projects but little talk about them.  I'll start


My bot is ExecutionBot and it's going to be for Counter-Strike.  
It's still in development, no code written yet.  Development is about half-way done I guess since I've been working on it off and on for the last year.  A lot of the details are clear but I'm still working out some important stuff like bot perception and a layer to sit between the Half-Life engine and the actual decision-making AI.

When the layer is done, I'll most likely distribute the code for everyone to use as they like.  I'm planning on making it very modular so porting the bot to another mod would be fairly simple.  

I guess I should give a quick feature list too... my major feature goals are:
-bot learns
-true human walking / aiming
-extracting strategic navigation model from BSP
-bots work as a team

There are more but I'll keep it short for now.

Okey dokey (nice idea this listing):

My bot is called Parabot, development nearly finished for HL deatchmatch. I'd like to port it to other MODs (CS or TFC) but haven't decided yet.

Implemented features:
- fully automated waypoint generation  ("map learning") 
- human-like movement
- dynamic routing (shortest, safest, fastest, ... way) depending on current situation
- (more or less) realistic aiming
- goal-driven behaviour

Planned features:
- team-work (depending on the MOD I'm going to support)

I've been working on that one for more than four months now and before that on another HL-bot (unreleased) for quite a long time...

My bot is called JoeBOT. It's designed for CS.

Its combat and anti collision system is based on artificial neural networks. (5-6-6-5,3-3-1)
The combat net makes decisions if the bot should run, stop, go back, jump duck, hide, and/or strafe. (ditlew's (nnbot) system is similar - i had this idea on my own, cause i wrote a nn-Simualtor some time ago, but i havn't noticed botman's template code, cause i had no inet @ that time)
Cause my bot is still based on template 1, i wrote my own chat system and till now I'm not using floyds algorithm, cause I havn't had already a closer look on it, instead i use a wp - based backtracking algorithm. The decision on what way to choose is dependent on the type of map and therefore of the goal.
The internal structure of my bot is obviously a bit Brooks-like (http://www.ai.mit.edu): a lot of rather simple behaviors running pseudo-paralell in a more or less hirachial order. 
Learning isn't really implementated, cause it's very difficult to decide on which pattern should be learned by the net. A week ago i categorized 'real-game' data with a Self Oragnzing Map to see if the pattern i gave to the neural net are really representing the situation in the game. U can see the results @ http://clanhosting2.counter-strike.de/~joebot/somdev.html

other stuff :
- human-like reaction time + aiming (ripped out botman's aiming code)
- human-like accuracy ( changeable )
- some little pieces of teamwork ... to be extended next time
- defusing/planting bomb, rescuing hostages and other little things ...
- fully wp undependant in fights ( standard i think)
- all weapons are supported
- weapon pickup system ... This's I'm just developing ( not in current release )

PS: I'm using this bot in my final exam. I'll have to write a longer text and talk a bit about it. if someone wants to read this text, email me. (Text is in german)

My bot is called Agrobot...

It's not to great with features, little behind the rest, but the main idea was to get the bot working with many different mods, it doesn't seem to be going to well at the moment, i'm getting quiet lazy, busy, and can't stop playing cs online....

The only features that i have that some people don't for mods i have ported my bot to are..

- Kill team mates(made it a little easier for testing sometimes)
- 2 Modes for when ran out of ammo(knife, and reload)

To bad i have not relased that version...ir lazy.

How about we make up a website get all the bot's cataloged, with waypoint submissions for all bots, then maybe i can make up some waypoint converter online, so then waypoints can be ported to all bots as soon as submited...

Then have idea submission, etc...

/me opens Notepad
/me opens PhotoShop
/me gets something to eat
/me comes back to notice that he needs a restart
/me restarts and thinks of a good layout
/me has a layout planed
/me has the graphics done
/me go's and gets more to eat
/me go's and plays some cs(be back in 1hr(err more like 8 hours) :-)

Spam me with email for some ideas for a bot site, even expand on the ideas i have said in this post...as i'm going to make one..and it is going to own..

Wow you're CS bot sounds amazing Execution Style...

I was thinking about stopping my bot since Ditlew and Stefan (authors of NNBot and RealBot respectively) have said that they are getting bored with CS, and so am I, but I was staying to see what new features were going to be in bots, etc... I think you had better get you're bots out quick before all the veteran CS player have stopped playing, and only newbies and cheaters are left :(      You're bot does sound amazing, I would like to play against it, but I want to move onto other things now, and possibly still work on my own bot as a little project every now and then... I would love to make my bot for another mod, that would make it more interesting, but I haven't downloaded any mods recetnly, and none sound too interesting. I think HostileIntent/UrbanWarfare looks pretty good, but it still has no release date, so by the time it is finished I will probably be studying at University and have no spare time left :(

Ive been thinking about what William said about your post the other day and you know I kinda relize what he was trying to say now because we may never beable to accomplish a bot that thinks like a human we might beable to get a bot that tries to mimic human behavior ive made a quick fix to botmans waypoint system basicly all the info from a served game is recorded and stops itself from recording when ever the entire map is cleared should be about an hour or 2. any how what the waypoints do now are quite different they not only tell the bot where to snipe but where he more likely to run or accurate also other things like where to ambush and im most likely to post a thread on this waypoint system in a couple weeks or even a month ive got to make sure there arent many bugs because well lol you guys arent the easiest to please :O) oh ya and keep up the good work!

The bot I am working on has no name and I purely experimental.  I just want to learn about C++ and AI.  Development has started since yesterday.  I am just now learning what part of code controls what part of bot, and things like that.  Overall, for my satisfaction, I am about .00000001% done.


btw:  Holybigjesus try using puctuation because run on sentences that are hard to follow and I dislike having to decipher your miles of sentences in order to get something functional to read so please next time try a few punctuation marks.

My bot is the CVW-Bot.  Its for CS, 

Does all the basics, buys guns, bomb planting/defusing.

Also moves to keep enemy in vision during combat, has reaction times, aiming that improves as the bot takes longer to aim, is worse at far distances etc.

Camps (just what you want from bots), but not very often (cause that was just too life-like ;)

The Bot I'm working on is called POD-Bot and does only play CS yet. It does all the basic things like map goals, rating weapons and picking them up, button pressing, aiming, perception & combat based on skills, camping, has reaction times, burst-firing, shooting through walls when applicable and most of this can be configured by the User. Basic teamplay (very basic!) is achieved by using radiocommands. Navigation is done by using waypoints. Latest Version released is V1.4x (which doesn't have some of the things mentioned above), you could get it from here:
http://www.nuclearbox.com/podbot/

Besides some less important things, I'm currently working on a better solution for decision making than my existing FSM. I did experiment with parallel behaviours and it turns out to be quite promising.

My main goal is to make the Bot an entertaining opponent to play against. There are a lot of smart Bots who I think are very well done in terms of killing enemies and accomplishing mission goals, but I've witnessed none so far, who actually tricked me into believing I'm playing against a human. Yes, that's my main interest. Besides, I want to code a solid AI framework I could use in future AI projects.

My Bot is BJLbot mainly designed for TFC (I ripped out all of the CS and other code I found.  So I only had TFC)

I started rewriting everything as too get better at programming, so far this is what my bot has:
-Basically the bots can use All Classes, still need to add in Sentry Building & Dispencer building.
-Fairly Good Navigation (Needs rewrite)
-Medics will heal you when you call them. (Soon)
-Engineers will give you armor when you call. (Soon)

I still need to get in realistic aiming in there, my bots fire dead-aim :(  I need some help creating the aiming system. (Just give me an insight on how to make it, don't post anycode maybe just peusdo-code) Sory I can't spell.

Hi,

My bot is the odd bot and is for tfc and front line force. I am also trying to S&I support working. It has all of the standard tfc features and version 1.4 is about to be released.

Well, my turn ;p

My bot has no name yet (I thought of Bot-e-guard - check the game of words !!), and I intend to make a teammate bot, i.e. design a bot that will cover you, check rooms for you, etc.
One of the main goals is the use of speech recognition AND text-to-speech (if I can get a Pentium V from Intel lol) to give order to the bot, but at least it should understand natural language in text form (I am using a custom ALICE chatter bot)...
Other classical skills (navigation, combat...) will be designed with AI techniques too (NN, maybe BlackBoards or Agents).

I know this sound a little utopic, but it is first a study project, and it doesn't really matter if the project is not running very efficiently.
Drop me a line if you want more info, I will post soon for further anouncements or questions (end of project is December).

See you.

Hey all!  I dont' have a name for my bot yet, but it's been coming along.. It's written with TFC in mind, specifically the 2fort map, though I suspect it can work on others ok.

This is what's been implemented so far:

Behavior editor - a PC app that allows you to "drag&drop" actions and string them together using a conditional language.  The GUI's getting slicker by the day.  Ready for release in about a month or so.

Function editor - a PC app that specifies what actions or information-gathering the bot can do.  The behavior editor uses it to give a bot author choices on what to do.

Run-time engine - code using the HPB Bot interface.  Takes the specs generated from the behavior editor and makes the actions/information operational.

So far I've been implementing the language for the run-time engine-- it's expressive as all heck, and it's easy to synthesize behaviors, but haven't had time to write a lot of interesting ones.  I could use some help if anyone's interested.  Email me for a snapshot of the apps.

I live in the Bay Area-- anyone going to be at the GDC?  Let's have a mod gathering :)

I am working on a bot for Half-Life: Paintball.  I have been working on it off and on for about 3 months now.  I am mainly using it as a learning tool.  I STILL do not have the bots reloading the secondary ammo (the co2) so they still dont shoot.  Once I get some real time, ill acctualy get this bot fixed.

The bot doesnt realy have a name, though I usualy call it HLPBot (half life paint bot).

I've taken over the development of the Rho-Bot (http://www.gamershomepage.com/rhobot/), basically because I got it to work with 1.1.0.4+ and that Eric Bieschke stopped work on it.

I've looked at botman's bot10 code, and botman a couple of suggestions for the code, which he added to HPB (I'm the *rsm* in the HPB).

I've been looking at the forum posts to see what suggestions and ideas would be good to add to the Rho-Bot.  Many of the vague ideas I had are being coded by the programmers in this forum.  My hat is off to all of you!  Especially you, Botman!  Thanks for the great web page and forum.

I'm tinkering with ImmirBot.

Currently it does nothing more than track radar positions of teammates and follow teammates who call out for it --- oh, and a bit of jumping if needed.

It uses Bird's Bot Manager; I've been developing ImmirBot partly to help Bird with finding features to add to the Bot Manager, and to help debug what he's already implemented.

My bot, is called RealBot. Its a CS Bot only. Although i tried to port it for several mods, CS is my main interest.

RB started as a big joke, and now its a bit more serious. Main goal is simulating real humans, which i think is accomplished very well when looking at combat behaviour. 

It is not 100% good at doors, buttons etc. The basic stuff. All it does at the moment, is walking around, shooting opponents and sometimes it does the map objective. 

I hope to improve the above statements in next releases.

My bot doesn't have a name, and isn't even started, but heres the plan :

People will be able to compete with bots they make themselves.

The bots will probably be .dll's or scripts.

People can connect to the server using half-life and vote which bot is the best.

People can connect to a seperate service run by the half-life server and manage their bots.

The client is planned to consist of these things :


A cool gui

Ability to connect to user accounts on the bot server

Clientside and Serverside "Plugins" to aid in bot development

Thats all i can think of now.
I've got a graphics library for windows i made. I was planning on using it for something else, but it seems this could be an interesting thing to use it on.
