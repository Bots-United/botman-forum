i'm doing something like this (code based on botman's template #3) in my BotThink function:

if(have_seen_someone) {
  pEdict->v.button |= IN_ATTACK;

  g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove( 
    pEdict, 
    pEdict->v.v_angle, 
    pBot->f_move_speed, 
    0, 0, 
    pEdict->v.button, 0, pBot->msecval);
}

the bot fires me the first time he sees me but then, he never fires again...
what's wrong with this ?

thanks guys.

perhaps, because of the MOD you are running, you will not continuosly fire if you keep attack held in, you could try it yourself. You might want to bot to release the attack key sometimes. Also they cant fire if they ran out of ammo, so you need to check for that and then reload.

the MOD i use is Counter Strike : it allows to keep attacking without releasing the "key" and it is not an ammo problem as the bot fires ONE bullet and then stops...
more info : the bot starts CT and then shoots one bullet with the base gun, without switching weapon... very basic ! but it works only once :o[

Perhaps your "have_seen_someone" is only TRUE once.
