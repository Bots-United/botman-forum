Hi... I am working on a Multi Bot named American X bot... I need some help with the navigation system and the waypoint system... I am adding bot support for AHL, Eod, Dod, The Opera, WHL etc etc etc... The bot was named System Bot but i renamed it... The bot has a web site but not updated on years... www.cs-splash.net
