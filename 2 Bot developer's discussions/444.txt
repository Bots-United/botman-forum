can someone give me the code to make bots find the next waypoint and not go back to the last 4 waypoints they just visited? I've jotted this down and tested several thing which in the end make the bots run in circles or get stuck in walls.

Have you coded anything of your own on this bot u are working on?.

 If you want to stop your bot from picking the last 4 waypoints that you have visted as the next waypoint to goto, then all you have to do is store what last waypoints some place (in a list - array of 4 should do you!). Then when it comes to picking the next waypoint, scan the list to see if your next waypoint is in this history list?. If it is in the list then don't goto it else if its not in the list then you can goto it!. 
 You will have to add some special code, to handle cases when you can't go anyway apart from backtrack along a waypoint that you just came from. 

There that should put you in the right direction.

yeah, i have. its really helping me doing this bot. i've done quite a few things to my bot, added weapon support, slightly improved navigation, and made it so bots can hear you walking or if you yell medic and they will come heal you if they are close. i may not be the best programmer, but im not the worst. thanks for the comments anyway.

If you want to see commands going from the clients to the server, turn on the "debug_engine" flag and do whatever actions you want on the client.  Exit the game and look through the "bot.txt" file found in the Half-Life directory.  Search for the "ClientCommand" functions and you'll see the text of the command sent from the client.  Shortly after them you'll usually see network messages (calls to pfnMessageBegin) going back to that client (or to all clients).
