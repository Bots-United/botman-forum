Well I've done a LOT of stuff to the nav system of my bots since Alpha 3, swimming, proper ladder usage (actually the basic HPB_bot ladder usage, but now the bots take ladder waypoints into account). Most of all THE BOTS CAN GET THROUGH THE WINDOWS IN ITALY!!!! And also the vents in siege.

/me is VERY happy :P

lol Ditlew is the NNBot coder, I make TEAMbot, but juse happen to be a moderator on the NNBot forum (I was an NNBot user long before I decided to make my own bot).

Alpha 4.5 is out now, and it has breakable item support!! So the bots kill the chickens in italy and can go through the side of the vents in militia!

I don't know why my bot is turning out so well, but it must have something to do with the fact that I've got nothing else to do all day :P

I seriously didn't expect it to catch up with NNBot/PODbot but I think I am getting close.

Just think what I can do when I get to Uni and learn about complicated AI stuff! The univesity I am going to (Aberdeen) specialises in AI, though not quite game AI. But I can still use the principals I learn (like Neural Networks and stuff) in games. How long do you guys think that CS will stay popular? I will probably still keep TEAMbot going as long as CS is popular, but I will have to slow down developement a lot once I start my studies...

cs is pretty much strong these days... i see only few people deviate from the mod. other popular stuff are DOD & holywars.

btw, could you make something on your page... similar to a techpage that http://unreal.epicgames.com does? as people wanting to use your source could see whats happening and new stuff that you put in the code... as well as newbie stuff too would greatly help!

I have a question concerning the BotClient_CS_VGUI method in bot_client.cpp of TEAMbot Alpha 4.5: why does one need to ignore 4 of every 5 fields sent to this function?

// This message is sent when the Counter-Strike VGUI menu is displayed.
void BotClient_CS_VGUI(void *p, int bot_index)

      ShowMessage(bots[bot_index].name);
      ShowMessage_SameLine(": ");

   static int state = 0;   // current state machine state

   if (state == 0)      // ignore next 4 fields sent to function (only want menu codes)

I already mailed u about this, but it's something to do with not all of the VGUI codes telling you which menu they are showing. The other codes are to do with menu formatting or something...

I remember trying to find (in the client.dll code included with the Standard SDK) where these other message fields get read.  Here's an example of a VGUI message for Counter-Strike...

pfnMessageBegin: edict=1dff614 dest=1 type=110
pfnWriteByte: 2
pfnWriteShort: 51
pfnWriteChar: -1
pfnWriteByte: 0
pfnWriteString:  
pfnMessageEnd:

...in vgui_TeamFortressViewport.cpp you can see where the menu id (iMenu) is read in MsgFunc_VGUIMenu(), but I never could find where the other 4 fields are read and used.  I assume it's somewhere inside ShowVGUIMenu(), but I didn't really take the time to find out.
