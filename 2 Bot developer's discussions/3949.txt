Would it at all be possible to program a bot to work on the client side instead of the server.  Like make a bot to join a server on its own (just give him the IP or something) and not be running on the server.  I think you get where I am going here.

Thank you, just want to know this before I start programming.

It's possible, a lot of the Quake1/Quake2 Bots were client-side as well. However client-side programming has been used a lot in the past to cheat in HL and its MODs so you will run in a lot of problems which might not be that easy to overcome. You would have to patch the VAC Security Modules from Valve, eventually even hiding your code from extra add-ons like punkbuster and the likes only to have a client-side Bot which also means you don't have so many informations like running your code on the server. Before attempting this huge task you might want to do some research first to see how incredibly difficult this would be, unfortunately all client bot forums I know of are closed now due to lack of interest/skills.

The biggest problem with creating a bot on the client side is that you have to decypher the Half-Life network protocol (which is encrypted with Blowfish encryption).

You can search this forum for "bot client" and you'll find some relevant discussions of this from about a year ago.

That's not a problem, I've got the Blowfish cypher source code printed on my T-shirt ;D "http://www.openbsd.orgOpenBSD RuleZ

(ok I stop spamming ;))

You can download the Blowfish code here...

...but the mark of a good encryption algorithm is that even when you have the source code you can't easily de-encrypt the packets without knowing the keys.  Your key is generated by WON and used when the server sends packets to the client.  Of course, the encryption goes both ways and the client must also encrypt packets going to the server.

Since the Half-Life recorded demo file is also encrypted (compare the packets in the .dem file to packet captured with a network sniffer or proxy), the encryption key for that specific "network" sequence must be contained in the .dem file itself.  Extracting this key would allow you to decode that specific demo file network stream.  Of course, the key will change every time you connect to a server, so you can't use the same key over and over.

Another way to create a client side bot would be to use a client DLL hook type application, very similar to the way many Half-Life cheats work.  Valve is working pretty hard to eliminate all client side hooks so I wouldn't recommend trying to get around the VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) and creating a client side bot that way.

You can also try a www.google.com search for "client bot Half-Life" and you'll find some interesting references (mostly cheating sites).

too bad cl_metamod isn't taken as seriously as it could be. But looking at it (and its source code) might be a good start for you to learn the basics about client-side dll hooks.

I hadn't even heard of cl_metamod until you mentioned it.

It seems to be a dead project as of July 2002.  VAC seems to have killed it and made the developer a little bit bitter.  ;D

I would be surprised if there were any publicly available client side hooks (that weren't OpenGL based hooks mostly only good for rendering modifications) that worked on Valve Anti-Cheat enabled servers.  Valve does a pretty extensive job of checking the modules loaded along with the Half-Life executable and preventing things from running that shouldn't be.

If you want client side bots that use hooking, you'll probably have to use an older version of the Half-Life engine (1.1.0.6 seemed pretty stable although it won't work with current versions of MODs).
