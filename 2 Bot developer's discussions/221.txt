It's for limiting Bots Vision I assume ? Just an idea, but what about hooking the ScreenFade Function to see if the screen goes all white ? This should work for flashbangs unfortunately not for HE-Grenades...

Grenades are not seen using a simple TraceLine. You can detect them through FindEntityInSphere. But by hooking this thing a Bot would already go blind/shocked whatever, if the Grenade is just flying through the air (before exploding). This might be avoided by checking oldorigin/origin if it's still moving (and if that values are used)...
What puzzles me, is that there is not a single new entity created when a smoke grenade blows up. Am I wrong, did you notice something (a Message for this whatever) ?
BTW. off topic, but did you check the damage_bits if a Bot got hurt in some way ? It seems that it is always DMG_GENERIC (0) in Cs all the time, which is bad since you can't detect different types of damage easily then...
