1) Choose a random waypoint from waypoints[ 1 ] that is visble, not nesecarily reachable.

This is all from the top of my head and you may have to define some of the vars depending upon where you put this, but here goes:

UTIL_TraceLine( pEntity->v.origin, waypoints[RANDOM_LONG(0,num_waypoints)].origin, dont_ignore_monsters, pEntity->v.pContainingEntity, &tr );

if (tr.flFraction >= 1.0) //trace hit nothing
{
// waypoint is visible
}
