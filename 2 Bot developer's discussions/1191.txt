There was somewhere a function which returns the color of blood ... with defines for the german version ... but I don't know exactly where ... sorry

I found this line:
virtual int            BloodColor( void ) { return DONT_BLEED; }

And changed it to:
virtual int            BloodColor( void ) { return BLOOD_COLOR_RED; }

But still it doesn't work. :(

virtual seems to indicate that this's a base class ... prob look @ the classes, who inhertited this class ...

The Standard SDK from Valve has blood disabled by default.  See the MOD FAQ for how to turn blood back on...
