Does anyone have an empty bot template where it is possible to add bots to a team using a console command and nothing else. So the bot just stands there?

That's quite easy to do with MSVC since you can easily delete files from the project (such as navigate, weapon cpp files etc)

But if you just want to keep all they files than all you have to do is to clear everythings thats in the BotThink function.
