Hello,

I was looking through the recent messages on the forum and I found the following lines which I don't quite understand.

bot_t *pBot; 
  edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict; 

I have to confess, that I only started to learn C++ and don't feel quite comfortable with pointers so if anyone could give me a sensible explanation of what does this expression do, I would really appreciate that.

Thanks.

This...

   bot_t *pBot;

...declares a pointer to a structure (called bot_t).  This doesn't allocate space for a bot_t structure (that's a VERY important tip with pointers), it simply creates a variable that would point to a bot_t structure if one existed in memory somewhere.  For example, DON'T try this...

   bot_t *pBot;
 
   pBot->bot_team = 1;  // don't do this!!!

You shouldn't do this because pBot isn't pointing at anything and writing to some random location in memory will/may cause the application to crash.

This...

   edict_t *pEdict = pBot->pEdict;

...declares a pointer to an edict_t structure (edict_t is defined in common\const.h as edict_s, and edict_s is defined in engine\edict.h).  It also initializes the pointer to the "pEdict" field inside the bot_t structure pointed to by "pBot".

The edict structure is used by the engine for entities.  You will see is used in many of the Half-Life engine functions.  The engine uses it to keep track of information about players, weapons, and other entities in Half-Life (or MODs).
