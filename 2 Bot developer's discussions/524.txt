Sure...

hl.exe -dev -console -game cstrike +sv_lan 1 -nomaster -noauth -maxplayers 8 +map cs_assault

...will probably do what you want.  Just stick it in the "Target" line of a shortcut to hl.exe.

Botman, where do you get all these commands from? I would be interested in the command options for simple HL...

I downloaded a file called "commands.pdf" from one of the dedicated server sites.  (it may have been planethalflife.com/commands)
