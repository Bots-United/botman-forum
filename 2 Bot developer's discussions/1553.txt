I can't find out why are this "waypoint save"  command crashes the engine? I haven't any bots on the map and stuff... Why, why, why??

Buy yourself a copy of Microsoft Visual C++ and run the MOD in the debugger.  If you are working on a bot for Counter-Strike then you will have to run the dedicated server version (hlds.exe) in the debugger since the client version (hl.exe) won't work properly with the debugger.  Any other MOD should work fine running under the MSVC debugger.

The debugger REALLY helps to track down those problems where the MOD or bot code is crashing.
