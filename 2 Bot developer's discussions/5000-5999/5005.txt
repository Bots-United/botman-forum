A. General compatiability issues

1) New weapons/items issue.
Because CS 1.6 has some new weapons and items, we must add these entities to our linkfunc.cpp:
env_lightning
env_rain
env_snow
func_rain
func_snow
weapon_famas
weapon_galil
weapon_shield

These things may not be 'entities'. I don't know what they are either. They are exported in CS 1.6 mp.dll. But as far as I know, there won't be any problems even if we don't care for them.
CountTeamPlayers
CountTeams
g_flTimeLimit

CS 1.6 new Weapon IDs:
#define CS_WEAPON_GALIL            14
#define CS_WEAPON_FAMAS            15


2) FL_FAKECLIENT issue.
CS 1.6 beta version has its integrated bot (Just like botman's HL deathmatch bot based on HLSDK). Although it has been removed in current version, there seems to be some bot-related code left in CS mp.dll. This may causes HL crashes as soon as you add a bot.

WORKAROUND: Do not use FL_FAKECLIENT to flag our bots. Use some other flag which is unused instead, such as (1<<27).

We can use the search/replace function to replace all "FL_FAKECLIENT" to "(1<<27)" in all source files except HLSDK headers.


3) WeaponList message issue.
In CS 1.6 the WeaponList client message is no longer sent with a edict.

WORKAROUND: We can change something like this in pfnMessageB
