Subject: How to port the bot to CS 1.6
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
A. General compatiability issues

1) New weapons/items issue.
Because CS 1.6 has some new weapons and items, we must add these entities to our linkfunc.cpp:
env_lightning
env_rain
env_snow
func_rain
func_snow
weapon_famas
weapon_galil
weapon_shield

These things may not be 'entities'. I don't know what they are either. They are exported in CS 1.6 mp.dll. But as far as I know, there won't be any problems even if we don't care for them.
CountTeamPlayers
CountTeams
g_flTimeLimit

CS 1.6 new Weapon IDs:
#define CS_WEAPON_GALIL            14
#define CS_WEAPON_FAMAS            15


2) FL_FAKECLIENT issue.
CS 1.6 beta version has its integrated bot (Just like botman's HL deathmatch bot based on HLSDK). Although it has been removed in current version, there seems to be some bot-related code left in CS mp.dll. This may causes HL crashes as soon as you add a bot.

WORKAROUND: Do not use FL_FAKECLIENT to flag our bots. Use some other flag which is unused instead, such as (1<<27).

We can use the search/replace function to replace all "FL_FAKECLIENT" to "(1<<27)" in all source files except HLSDK headers.


3) WeaponList message issue.
In CS 1.6 the WeaponList client message is no longer sent with a edict.

WORKAROUND: We can change something like this in pfnMessageBegin() function in engine.cpp:

      if (ed)
      {
..................
           index = UTIL_GetBotIndex(ed);
           if (index != -1)
           {
..................
              else if (msg_type == message_WeaponList)
                 botMsgFunction = BotClient_CS_WeaponList;
..................

To:
      if (msg_type == message_WeaponList)
          botMsgFunction = BotClient_CS_WeaponList;
      else if (ed)
      {
..................

4) pfnGetGameDir issue.
Half-Life 1.1.2.0 has a minor change to this engine function. This function in non-steam version of HL returns something like "C:\Sierra\Half-Life/cstrike", but in HL 1.1.2.0 it returns only "cstrike".

WORKAROUND: Take a look at botman's HPB-Bot 3.0 source code and you'll get it. HPB-Bot 3.0 has already solved this problem.


B. CS 1.6 auto detection.

      bool IsVersion16 = FALSE;
      unsigned char *tempbuf;

      tempbuf=(*g_engfuncs.pfnLoadFileForMe)("sprites/weapon_famas.txt",NULL);

      if (tempbuf)
      {
            IsVersion16 = TRUE;
            (*g_engfuncs.pfnFreeFile)(tempbuf);
      }

Note: Don't use fopen() or access() functions in standard C library because they may not work. We should use HL engine function because that file is in Steam GCF cache.



C. Something about the shield.

1) Check whether a player has the shield.
bool HasShield(edict_t *pPlayer)
{
   if (strncmp(STRING(pPlayer->v.viewmodel), "models/shield/v_shield_", 23) == 0)
      return TRUE;
   return FALSE;
}

2) Check whether the shield is put up.
bool ShieldUp(edict_t *pPlayer)
{
   if (!HasShield(pPlayer))
      return FALSE;
   if (pPlayer->v.weaponanim == 6 || pPlayer->v.weaponanim == 7)
      return TRUE; // 6: already put up, 7: putting up, 8: putting down (How to say these in English?)
   return FALSE;
}

********
Hope this helps. Please point out any mistakes.

You use Markus' POD-bot 2.6, right ?

1. Bots won't move in CS 1.6 because pfnSetClientMaxSpeed is not initally called and bots have a move speed of zero. To change that, look in BotInit() or BotSpawnInit() -can't remember how he called this function, it's the function that resets most of the variables in the bot structure to their default values-, and instead of setting f_max_speed to zero, set it to CVAR_GET_FLOAT("sv_maxspeed") - which is usually 250.

2. He commented out the line to display waypoints in the waypoints editor.

I fixed it to use CVAR_GET_FLOAT("sv_maxspeed") as I read a few other people mention this problem, however with podbot 2.6 source,  I cannot seem to get them to join a team - they sit in spectator mode.

I've read a few other people mention this problem but so far haven't read any definite fixes or answers to it.  
Only trouble is I can't see to get debugging with Steam working so I can't find the exact problem causing them not to join.  Even tried using it with Metamod and Adminmod but to no avail.

I have pretty much been through every CS 1.6 thread in Bot development forums and made all the correct compatibility issues that I know of.

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be more than happy to hear them - Thanks.

f_max_speed is already CVAR_GET_FLOAT("sv_maxspeed") and none of the waypoint lines are commented. I'm using the default PODBot 2.6 source. Bots just doesn't do anything... they don't shoot, they don't turn, they don't move etc...
