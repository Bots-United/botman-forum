There's a new website available for bot developers, bot users, and people who are generally interested in bots...

http://www.bots-united.com/

There is also a forum there...

http://forums.bots-united.com/

which, I'm sure, will contain many discussions about general bot development, behavior and other bot related issues.

Some of the bot specific forums on NuclearBox will get moved to Bots-United.  RealBot, JoeBot, RACC and others are already available on the Bots-United forum.

Why don't you stop by there and join in the discussions?

BTW, we've made you a super moderator at Bots United (you were already supermod at the BSCW server). You can come and participate in the admin and mod discussions now - and prepare for the future of your forums, too (as what I recall you told me in PM some time ago) :)
