Hi!

I'm wanting to make a bot for Counter-Strike or other mods such as TFC and I was wondering if I
could do it using Delphi because I'm not a C++ programmer. Is there a chance that a bot for cs can be developed? If yes where do I start?

Thanks!

Any language that can create a DLL with C-style exported function names (no leading underscore) can be used to make a bot for Half-Life.

You'll need to start with the HPB bot source code and convert everything from C to the language of your choice (which means you have to understand C to be able to do this).

I'm no Delphi expert... but I doubt it will be possible... especially for things like this :
code:

void BotClient_CS_CurrentWeapon (void *p, int bot_index)


The same parameter is given different types depending on the state machine state...
Can Delphi/Pascal cope with "void" pointers ? I'm not sure...

[edited] oh, and btw, I remember having been told that Delphi passes function parameters on the stack in the opposite order than C does... if it will not cause an issue with engine functions interfacing, you are lucky...

It wouldn't makemuch sense to make another CS bot, unless you could implement new features.

well, there are already many other cs bots, but if you like cs, why not write a bot. It can be quite good for your programming skills :)

It would be even better if you could implement NEW features LoL, that's like someone re-writing the HPB source code, it's "Well ok, it does the same thing but this time I WROTE IT :)"

Well, are there bots that work in CS that have a linux port?  I like Podbot, but CF hasn't ported it (yet).  (and Botman won't accept bribes to adapt HPB to CS ;) )
