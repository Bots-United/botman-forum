how do you get the bots to run into the bot building waypoints? and it seems they dont even know whats happening when they build them because when they build they try to jump over the sg to get away from it.

Your bot is good for version one.
Good fighting style on the bots, they don't just run into a fight.
It was good to see a bot built sentry gun get 2 kills.
I posted up an amusing snapshot at this link

Soldier and Pyro are helping Mr Engineer build his gun. Hehehe, if only he would upgrade it and turn it to face the enemy.
Maybe in a later version

Nice touch to have the engy keep hitting people with the spanner and the medics were healing me as soon as they saw me with less than full health. They play better than some humans on public servers :)

Great work man
