Hi ,

Can anybody please help me in solving this issue.

I am getting the following error message while compiling HLSDK source with MingW32 compiler

airtank.cpp:62: static_cast from `{unknown type}' to `void (CBaseEntity::*)()'

The real origin of this message is because of a macro 

#define SetThink( a ) m_pfnThink =  static_cast<void (CBaseEntity::*)(void)> (a) 

located in cbase.h file 

Can anybody tell me what is the problem with this macro ?

Thanks in Advance
Remesh Job

Did you download the MingW32.exe from my website or get the one from www.mingw.org?  If you got the one from the MingW32 web site then it won't work.  The newer version of MingW32 is not compatible with the Half-Life SDK (that's why I made an older version available on my web site).  Download the one from my website, make the necessary changes to the SDK files and try again.
