Hi all !

I'm currently thinking about doing a hybrid Pathfinding Code using Floyd-Warshall for urgent cases and A* for normal pathfinding. I want to get the shortest path for Bots with good skills and lame paths for the worse ones. I'm quite unsure how to measure the best Distance for the heuristic Value with A*. A simple way I thought of, would be to use the Floyd Algoritm to get the shortest Path and that way also the minimum distance from A to B. I then could add skill based Values to this "best" Path. Another one would be to get the difference between Waypoint Number A and B, multiplying it with the average distance between waypoints. But this would fail since the Numbers aren't ordered. Waypoint Nr. 350 could aswell be placed right beside Waypoint Nr. 1.
Any ideas, anyone ?

Simple method ere matey.

Simply create a second floyd array and when it is calculated add or subtract random values from the distances. Making the path inaccurate.

You could as well use the geometric distance between the waypoints for the heuristic function:
h = (wPnt1.pos-wPnt2.pos).Length();
The only problem you get with this approach is that it doesn't work with teleporters (long distance but reachable in an instance).

Any heuristic will do (for an optimal solution) as long as it does not overestimate the actual (travel) costs. The most popular ones are:
- geometric distance
- travel time (geometric distance divided by the maximum speed)

If you want A* to return the optimal solution, teleporters force you to have a 'zero' cost heuristic for any 'remaining' path. In other words, performance breaks down to Dijkstra levels (not that bad).

If you want random paths, you can use a cost functions that sometimes overestimates travel costs. [here's the answer you want, I guess]
For example, assume a lower than maximum speed when computing the 'travel time' and you'll have bots ignore fast paths in favor of water paths.

The (internet) source to visit on A* is at Amit Patel's page:

You're all great, thank you!

DarkYouth:
No, I won't corrupt my Floyd Tables (just think of the extra memory used and the extra calculating time).

Tobias:
It's not alone teleporters. Just think of zigzag ways round corners or a path which forces to move in an opposite goal direction round corners. It won't work well in this case, I guess. Nevertheless it's a simple & good idea...

William:
I hoped you would post to this thread. As always you're the best source of information (sorry to all other guys). I will do it that way and I knew Amit Patel's page before since this seems to be the only Webpage which heavily concentrates on A Star. In fact I tweaked his example A* tile code to use with my Bot before, but dumped it then due to crashes sometimes (and the much simpler Floyd approach). I will give it a 2nd try...
BTW. will your BotAid and CGF pages see updates soon ? They seem to be the only pages of interest for me concerning Bots...I visited them last night and they seem to be freezed...also the link to your MessageBoard doesn't work anymore. Huh?

BotAID has been frozen since it started for various reasons.

I'm working on some CGF updates (though stealthily stuff on weapon handling AI has been added to the pages: http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/design_weapons.shtml ). 

Problem is that every next feature that is added to the CGF AI takes more time than the previous one (because it needs to be integrated with all existing features). I'm more or less spending as much time on CGF as I did during the previous two years.

If you want to be certain to reach me, just send me an email.
