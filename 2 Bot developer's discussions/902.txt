Hi, I've added a class system to my mod, and the game now crashes when a bot is being adedd, I think this is because the bot forces a key movment, when you can't "move" the player, or the bot just does not select a team. I know my description of the class system thingy is a bit vague, but I hope its simple.

But, in TF, I believe the bot would just be "unassigned" if it did not select a class, so is the crashing most likly to be the foced movement? When I say forced, stuff like setting the forward value to somthing != 0.

Thanks.

I think that if a bot is not initialiased, eg has not chosen a team/class, then the movement code is not executed... in BotThink.cpp the bot is told to select a team/class if need_init == TRUE or something like that.

So just set need_init to 1/TRUE until the bot has chosen a team/class? That should do it if it is simply movemement which is causing the problem...

It's quite improbable that forced movement is causing the crash. When you (as a player) try to move while still in intermission the game doesn't crash neither. I would look at other parts of the code and try to comment out suspected parts. This way you could verify your hypothesis of the movement crash as well.

I think I may have solved the problem, I think I was wrong (I have not had chance to try it yet)
1) I found (and heard) a bot did connect into the game.

2) I added a function into player.cpp that went something like:

CBasePlayer :: Class( void)
{
(code to set the name from a stucture, like the naming system in the HPB_Bot)
}

Could this cause the crash? I.e. If we deefine the function as part of CBasePlayer (In player.h), would this function get executed? The real player (me/you) never has the "You are a:" name printed. <I got the class tutorial from Bigguys' site.>

But I still can't see why the bot now crashes when entering, but not a real player, If I solve the problem, I'll let you know. Any ideas?

Hi,

are you setting 
pev->flags I= FL_FAKECLIENT;


in your join code? every frame?

bye,

For real players you Class()-function probably will never get called... It could indeed cause the problem, because:
1) Have you linked the modified player.cpp to your project?
2) If so, does the engine recognize it and not use its own compiled player-class but yours?
Two questions, two possibilities to crash...
