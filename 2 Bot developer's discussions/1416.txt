Hi all ! I'm new here

I would make bots for TFC and TFC only. 

I would that my bots don't take ammo when they have more 60% of ammo but I don't know how ? I'have found iAmmo1, iAmmo2, ... in bot_current_weapon_t and bot_weapon_t but I don't know of to use it and witch is the good ?

please help me!
thx.

Hi David!

I can't help you with code because I don't have my sources here, but just from memory it's something like this:
The ammo-variables in bot_current_weapon_t store the amount of ammo the weapon has in its current clip. These get changed when you reload your weapon. 
The variables in bot_weapon_t do *NOT* contain the amount but the type of ammo that the weapon uses. You will have to use this type as an index to another table (which name I can't remember) that stores the amount of each type of ammo you have got in reserve.
I hope that I remember things right (it has been a while) - if any of the other guys has corrections or some easy to understand sample code please post it.

I would actually like to know this too. I didn't know that they pointed to ammo types, I thought they held the ammo levels!

This is from bot_combat.cpp (in the BotFireWeapon function)...
code:
pBot->m_rgAmmo[weapon_defs[iId].iAmmo1]

iId is the weapon ID (like VALVE_WEAPON_CROSSBOW) and iAmmo1 is the primary ammo ID value.  The m_rgAmmo[] array gets updated by AmmoX network messages and CurrentWeapon network messages.

The maximum ammount of ammo the weapon can carry (not the clip but the total) is stored in the WeaponList network messages in the iAmmo1Max field.

So if you wanted to know if the bot was carrying at least 70% of the max ammo for a weapon you could do something like this...
code:
int iId;
float percent;
 
iId = VALVE_WEAPON_MP5;
percent = pBot->m_rgAmmo[weapon_defs[iId].iAmmo1] / weapon_defs[iId].iAmmo1Max;
 
if (percent < 0.70)
{
   // not enough ammo yet, go search for more...
}
