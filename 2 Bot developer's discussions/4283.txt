run in debug mode and see where its crashing on the call stack to narrow it down.

It's an engine failure message, running a debugger upon this won't help.

Isn't it rather :
"Can't find proc: #nnnnnnnn"
??

I have had this error before aswell. (While making a HL MOD)

The solution to my problem was where i used TraceLine to find out where my bullet would hit (the calculations weren't correct). However, i don't know why such an error appears in a bot creation, as it never did for me. I am just posting to let you know pierre, it is "Can't find address: <hex number here>"

thanx for the reply's and Pierre its 'Can't find adress: <hex number>' i know this this for sure well anyway if it is a trace problem then its noth mine cause when i use the bot on the previous mod version everything is fine. I've run it in debug mode and if the game crash (probely of this) it said it couldn't find the edict. Further there's  are not realy special messages only the can't find adress thing you see and i saw something at the begin: 
Cbuf_InsertText: overflow
Cbuf_InsertText: overflow
maybe its nothing cause i don't really know much about debugging so maybe i set something wrong.

Are you somewhere sending text to one client in a string >192 characters long ?

maybe it could but still its strange that the bot works fine for the previous mod version. I was thinking isn't something wrong with objects(i use botman's template #3) maybe there must change something like more/less functions in it, i'm not very familiar with objects anyway so i'm just guessing also Pierre i saw in your template that you do something like the LINK_FUNC thing but then else could that help?
