So heres a couple of links :

Thats a couple of interesting links...



And I was watching some nice documentary here one day when I came up with a nice(funny) idea...
Its possible to measure the signals your brain sends for any specific action you are thinking about, and you can recognize those signals too.
So what if you could "record/log" the brain signals of a person that is playing a game,record one action at a time(ie: move forward,aiming,jumping..) Then you could mark every signal. And then program some functions that does what each brain signal would do. Like when the computer/reciever gets a signal that is logged/marked as "move forward" it moves the player forward. And with enough logging and practice the player would finally be able to play the game without and controllers except his brain and and some cables attached to his head...

In theory this is all possible =)

I believe I saw something called "Thinkpad" or something on a Technology tv show. It measures brain waves (electrical pulse signals) and a company is developing it. Last time I saw it does GUI navigation i.e. Windoze. It's like voice recognition where it has to get used to the pitch characteristics or your voice where the thinkpad records your brainwave when you think about a mouse click or a mouse movement. When these "Thinkpad" are marketed commercially will sell out like pancakes, wouldn't it be cool to not have to: not clean out your mouseball every so often, have both hands free to scratch your back, relax without having to sit forward and so on. I believe the "Thinkpad" also records words that you think in your brain. I think the inspiration for this technology is from some movie done in the 70's about a America guy getting into Russia to steal a Mig-29 and he had to think Russian language to control the Mig-29, it was all hands free.
