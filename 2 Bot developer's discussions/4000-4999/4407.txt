Okay I used the C++ compiler from Bloodshed www.bloodshed.net and it won't work!
It keeps reporting missing files and when I do move all Botmans files (Was mostly an experiment) to the same directory and starts the compile.
It then dumps and says a lot of the code is wrong and refuses to compile the .dll

I guess it is the compilers problem, any idea of a free temporary compiler that I can use until I get MS Visual C++? It is going to be a while I reckon.

After I did the post I tried that free compiler, problem is that it is DOS and I need something windows stuff.
I work sometimes in a heavy admin weighted down win2k enviourment and that complicates this compiler.
I did find a strange error in my current compiler, it tries to make a HPBbot.exe instead of .dll
Hmmm I wonder how I can correct this, it allows dll writing too.
I thought the coding was the hardpart, now it is the compiling that is difficult.

I use MinGW c++ compiler as it is free, light and powerful (g++ linux compiler port)
it works perfectly under windows environment but is command line based. As the unix "make" tool is ported too, once you made your Makefile, you just have to type "make" in a msdos command line...
not too hard isn't it ?
(HPB template comes with a good Makefile)

good luck

PS : Visual C++ won't help you more than this compiler. Check GNU Emacs for editing C++ stuff.
