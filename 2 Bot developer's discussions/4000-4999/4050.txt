I have been trying to get HPB bots to use all the weapons in DMC. They never use the rocket launcher or the grenade launcher, they do use all the other weapons. I have read all the posts concerning this problem and not knowing much about c++ I am just shooting in the dark trying to fix the code. Anyone have a fix? 
remeber I'm a noob at this so go easy on me,  :)
Thanks

They used the rocket launcher and the grenade launcher the last time I played with them in DMC.

Try this.  Make your own DMC map with JUST a rocket launcher.  They'll pick it up and use it (as long as they don't have other weapons and as long as the enemy isn't too close to them).

Do the same thing with the grenade launcher.  Create your own map with just grenade launchers.  They'll use them as long as the enemy is far enough away that they won't get damaged themselves.

Yes I did this, I used stripper2 to remove all other weapons and I then put a rocket launcher and rockets at every spawn point. The bots still never use the rocket launcher or grenades. I have been running them for several months and I play a lot. also there are a few other servers running them and they have the same trouble. A friend made a server side mod where the only weapons are the crowbar and the rocketlauncher, you spwan with the rocket launcher. The bots have the rocketlauncher when they spawn but they don't fire it, if you stay a ways away from them they just point it at you and chase you around. Then when they get close they switch to the crowbar and never back to the rocket launcher. I like the HPB bots they are very stable on the server and one of the only ones that will support a linux dedicated DMC server. Maybe you could fire up DMC and check it out? or you could join one of my servers with HPB bots. 12.229.178.242:27050 this one is midair mod (only rocketlauncher and crowbar) with HPB bot or 12.229.178.242:27015 or 27016 normal and low gravity DMC servers.
Thanks for your time I know your busy.

I can try to take a look at it, but I won't have the time to create another release and put that up to make it available for download.

I'll let you know if I find anything.

OK thanks, I know you don't have time, thats cool.
Maybe steer me in the right direction, I have been tinkering with the bot_combat.cpp so far with no success. Might help if I actually knew what I was doing, hehe.
Thanks again.

You can try testing my linux build for my bots that work with DMC (also rocket crowbar,cstrike hldm and other mods) I haven't tested the linux build, but I've heard people say it crashes on RC, (http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pat.murphy/rcbot for the site)

Yes I have tried the rcbots, they do use the rocketlauncher and all the guns. but they crash the server ever few minutes, even with no admin mod or any other plugins except metamod. :( nasty one too, it just freezes and won't restart.

I found this thread where cheezy had solved the problem.

Maybe he could post the code for the fix?

OK my bad, fixed the wrong side of the bug :)

Uploading version 3.0.2 at http://www.racc-ai.com/HPB_bot_plugin.exe
Tested, this time. Works.

You may recompile it for Linux if you want, but you'll probably have to commit a few minor changes in the source code. Look for the metamod stuff in dll.cpp, between the line that says
code:

// START of metamod stuff


and the line that says
code:

// END of metamod stuff


I suppose you'll have to #include <strings.h>, and also to change the DLLMain() function into a _fini() function. Other than that everything else should be straightforward.

Enjoy :)

What do I need for that? The Half-Life SDK and the Metamod SDK?
This is the first time i want do recompile a source at linux.

Yes you need both the metamod source and the halflife SDK to comiple the bots.
Here try this binary :)

http://www.free-fall.net/downloads/rlbots.tar.gz

Actually there are 2 files in there one normal with all weapons and one I modified to remove the Lightning gun for a mod I run that spawns you with all weapons, the bots are a little much with the Lightning gun, hehe

About the other bug you're talking about, are you sure it wasn't already with the HPB_bot ? Else it may be your metamod config... the bots don't do this here.

Anyway, back to mine now :)
Anyone wants to help me finally fix my navmesh ?

Maybe it was because I was lazy and tarred them up with winzip, it extracts fine on my XP box.
Guess that'll teach me ;)

Yes, this file has no crc error. But when i start my server with the new files (testet HPB_bot_i486.so and HPB_botnolg_i486.so) then my server crashed:

I'm uploading the 3.0.3 version.

http://www.racc-ai.com/HPB_bot_plugin.exe

should fix the 3s lag issue. Not sure where it may have come from, but I've removed the quick "optimizations" I had made in botman's code. Perhaps the cause of the lag was that gpGlobals->frametime would be unreliable (I already suspected that).

Chris, It's a meta mod plugin you can't run it with the +localinfo line in your start up ;)

PM, that seems to have done the trick, thanks again man :) I really appreciate all your work :)

Chris, I sent you the latest compile, I doubt PM would be willing to make them harder for you. You best try on your own :)
Unless PM wants to test his new navmesh and aim code on us :-D

Hi!

QUOTE:

Now it's funny to play with the bots. But they are even to easy with botskill 1. Is there any chances to make them harder?




I forgot to set the bot_reaction_time from 2 to 0. Now they are good.

@Mark

Thanks for the second mail!

hmm, maybe I spoke to soon, they seems to be freezing still about the same.
I thought maybe it was the waypoint files so I renamed one and they still acted and navigated about the same. Aren't the hpb bots supposed to write their own waypoint file if there isn't one for a custom map? I know they used to they don't now.
most strange ;)

Curious...
Not only they don't seem to freeze here, but also I really don't see what would cause it, since the changes I made to botman's code are extremely minor. The biggest change is the hooking of a new message for DMC, called "QItems".
I'd like to be sure it's not your server causing the lag...
Could someone else tell me whether he experiences this bug or not ?

Anyway, know that I won't be fixing this bot my life long. I'll give up as soon as it starts to annoy me.

Another server operator I let try them has seen the same thing.
The version before the wep fix didn't do this but I will try to load it again to make sure, it's not lag it's a screamin fast machine with loads of memory, seems odd.
still it could be me, I will keep looking into it.
Thanks for the effort :)

Ok, so I put back the pre weapon fix HPB plugin bots and no freezes, changed maps a bit let them run for a while. They happily run round shooting nails and shotguns.
Next I put back the latest ones with the weapon fix, all was good no freezing until I changed maps then it started freezing again, so I added another bot that one was fine but the original one was still freezing :/ so I kicked the freezing one and changed maps. Now the new one is freezing, by freezing I mean it pauses for a fraction of a second every 3 seconds like clock work. ok so now I add another bot, this one is fine the other is freezing, so I change maps with both bots on. The freezing one is still freezing the other one is not freezing, hmm.
My config is the same for all this testing so I doubt thats it plus it's run for a long time. My server it's even close to maxed.
I have another server where the min max bot stuff is set so they leave and join as players do, and they seem to be fine so far.
but the one with the addbot where he same bot stays on every map change starts freezing.
anyway hope this helps.
Thanks PM I am sending you 3 college girls in a hot tub, hehe
:)

Hi!

I can't confirm this bug. There are no freezes with 16 bots at my server.

I don't know what's causing it, I ran a basic test server with only metamod and the bots and it still does it :(
In fact I had one bot running in super slo mo today while the other one was fine, This was on my slackware 9.1 box, my red hat 9.0 box has the same kind of issues.
Beats me :(
These are steam servers that this is happening on.

YAY
Fixed, I was running a high sys_ticrate to boost fps on my servers, although I have been running this cvar for a long time without problems with normal HPB bots.
Aparently the plugin variety dosen't like anything over 100fps :(
Thanks again PM, I owe you one ;)

P.S. It would be sweet to see a Linux port of your racc bots, I think they are the most realistic playing bots I have seen.
