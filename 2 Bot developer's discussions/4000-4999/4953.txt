...is released :)

- Many bugfixes.
- Important rewriting in places.
- Many more inline comments.
- More readability & reusability.
- Got rid of my first method of engine abstraction layer. Was causing lag. But easily redoable, in a better way.
- Tidied up the engine <=> gameDLL interface for simple readability and maximum efficiency.
- Merged the old bot combat code of the RACC template so people at last get bots that shoot.
- Fully working DYNAMIC navmesh, featuring ever-changing paths and 7 different reachabilities (9 if you include jumping and ducking).
- Fully working, time-sliced, parallelizable A* pathmachines that can update goal and start nodes DYNAMICALLY even while in a search.
- Many visual debug tools and server commands, ability to debug separately each of the 6 AI vectors. Separate debug tools for the pathfinder that enable you to see the A* search expanding in realtime, like in "A* Explorer", but directly in the game upon the navmesh.
- Ability to dump whole or part of the navmesh into BMP files for flat representation or DXF files for 3D vector representation and debugging.
- Support 6 MODs so far (Azure Sheep, Counter-Strike, DMC, Opposing Force, TFC and Half-Life)

drawbacks:
- Stupid bots. you have to write the AI yourself, eh ;D

The work on RACC is still far from being terminated, however bot coders can be assured to find a lot of cool stuff in this template. Enjoy! 8)

we should actually rip out that navmesh code and impement it into everybody's bot, lets see how Valve will react then to their 'advanced' bots ;)

J/K though, its interesting and when i _KNOW_ how to code it myself i'll may be adding it (i want to actually, to combine with the node theory.. we should mail about that though).

good job pierre ;)
