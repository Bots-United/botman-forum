i cant see to get it to work

i found the code that checks for a dll and sets the dlltype so i changed it for DMC cuz my mod now is basicly a copy of that. and its crashes on addbot

Are you using MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)?  If so, run the game in the debugger and you'll be able to see where things are going wrong...
