Lol nice made up word eh? Well I was just wondering how some of you guys got started with waypoint less bots? Do you check all around the bots then set down like markers for them to remember by themselves the right ways to objectives or what? Looking for some ideas to incorporate in my bot.

In my own experience with waypointless bots :

-What works best for flawless navigation is to have the bot fire bursts of tracelines from the left edge to the right edge of its field of view, then deduce the path directions by index of the peaks in the derivation of the distances graph. See: http://www.racc-ai.com/img/bot-fov-snapshot.png

-What works best for waypointless pathfinding is to store memory markers at intersections, with pointers to the intersection directions describing either a way or a dead-end, and then let the bot work like a BFS (best first search) algorithm works, investigate one direction first, come back, mark the first direction as bad, then investigate the second one. Next time the bot will pick up the right direction.

-Those memory markers can also be used for ladders, elevators, buttons and triggers ; actually they SHOULD be used for it. Too bad I had lost in a HD crash the source code I was working on formerly with bot memory in it, before I switch to my BSP tricks...

-Staircases remain a problem, unless you have the fastest machine in the world that allow you to make the bot perform a 3D traceline scan of its FOV instead of a flat scan.

These are all the principles I put together in my first bot, and they proved to be the best working waypointless solution ever wrote *boast* *boast* but of course, you can't compare to the efficiency of a waypoint-driven bot such as PodBot or JoeBot... or even HPB_bot :(

but in the end it's still a winnable challenge...

If you don't want to attempt to construct a navigation mesh or grid by cranking through the world polygons (NO small feat, especially if you don't have much 3D engine programming experience), you might want to consider just letting the bots randomly wander around the world and occasionally dropping waypoints (you can call them whatever you want, they're still waypoints ;)).

When randomly dropping waypoints, you might want to have a minimum distance that the waypoints would be apart from each other.  You also might want to make sure each waypoint is visible from some other waypoint.  Keep a short 'history' of where the bot has been and whenever they go out of sight of the most recently placed waypoint, drop one at one of the recent previous 'history' locations (so that it will still be within sight of the waypoint that the bot is currently out of sight from).

You might also want to look at the automatic waypoint generator code I have in my BSP tools.  It isn't nearly complete as far as placing waypoints in intelligent places.  It basically does a flood fill of the level, automatically placing points at ground level.  Once all the waypoints have been dropped automatically, you can manually go back and clean them up to remove points that are in places a bot could never get to (like the roofs of buildinds) and clean up areas where waypoints are centered in narrow hallways or on narrow ledges, etc.

lol reason why I wonder is because my game crashes every time I try to save waypoints. So I was looking into letting the bot figure its way around. I might look into the flat scan infront of them maybe instead of just a side to side they could do a cross? that might work for stairs right. btw I cant see that screen shot...

Also why does my bot crash? First I cant run it in debug mode it always has to be on final realse then I cant make waypoints cause it crashes when I try to save. Then I made way points with the bsp tools and saved them in the maps folder for ns and it still says no waypoints for this map. Somethings really odd with my bot...
