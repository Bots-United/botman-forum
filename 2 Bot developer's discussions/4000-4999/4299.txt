LoL hi all. I am having a rather annoying problem.
I am using hpb_bot template and it works for my new mod http://www.hostultra.com/~armod/ so i converted the CSTRIKE bot mode to airsoft reloaded so now it works and all is fine but they wont attack eachother any idea why? is there some identifier that says who is an enemy i need to change? well the teams for the mod are red and blue and the spawn points are info_playerstart_red and info_playerstart_blue

i dunno it baffles me (= if ne one could help it would be much apriciated thanx alot see ya's

You'll have to write your own version of the UTIL_GetTeam() function, if I remember the name correctly. Else the bots will believe they are all the same team.

Hmm I looked in the template and I saw some team functions where to join. Is that the problem?
What if you tell the bot to go random each time? What will thoose effects be? Won't the mod automatically balance the teams?

No, it's not that one. I am talking about the function that returns a number depending on the team the bot is in, which is different given the MOD you play the bot with.

Darn, don't remember the name, and too lazy to search. Shouldnt be that hard to find though.
