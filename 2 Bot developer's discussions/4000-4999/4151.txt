Can someone post some example code on how to "reliably" get the number of bots and humans on the server, what teams they are on and whether they are dead or alive?

Thanks.

Teams are MOD specific.  There's no single code that will indicate what team a player is on for every possible MOD.

You can loop through players and see which ones have the FL_FAKECLIENT bit set to determine which players are bots.  You can look at the edict_t 'health' field to see if it's greater than zero (those players will be still alive).  As for teams, there's some example code of determining which team a player is on in the HPB bot util.cpp file that supports Half-Life deathmatch, DMC, Counter-Strike, TFC, Frontline Force (older versions) and HolyWars.  You can extend this to include other MODs if you need to.

beware of "intermission states", where players are attributed non-null health and are still in spectator mode (team selection in TFC, for example).
