Client side "variables" are called CVARs.  Most of the CVAR (console variables) are defined in cl_dll\input.cpp, cl_dll\inputw32.cpp, cl_dll\in_camera.cpp or cl_dll\view.cpp

Look at those files for examples.

I would like to add variables that can differ per client to your bot template, I don't know if you got that out of my previous post?

But thanks anyway for responding so quickly.

You want to support config (or configuration) settings, not CVARs.

You can use many different methods of creating configuration settings.  My preference is to create a text file that the end user can edit with any text editor and have the program read that text file to dermine program variable settings (like skill level for example).

If you want to use Windows .ini files to store configuration information, this can be done as well, using the Windows API functions to read and write .ini file settings.  Searching on www.google.com for "windows ini source code" will probably give you some examples.

You could also store the configuration information in a binary file that was NOT easily edited by the end user (since it's not in text form).  You would need to create your own tool that edits this information and updates the file.  This technique is useful if you don't want users placing invalid or illegal configuration data into the file (for example, setting the values beyond allowed ranges, etc.).  Again, searching on google.com for something like "configuration editor source code" or something similar will probably give you some examples.

Ehh not really, I think we still have some miscommunication, but thanks a million anyway :-P

What I want to create are additional int's, long's or float's, like just like the player health or the player armour, I just need them to be able to be different per client(just like health or armour).

Then you want client side CVARS.  See the files I mentioned above.

Eekhoorn, I don't unserstand exactly what you want to do either I think botman is guessing that your wanting to add console commands, I think you might be wanting to add new C+ variables, but when you talk about client side and nothing else, it's confusing me ??? !
