What is the difference (botmaking wise) between dedicated server and not?

The only difference I know is that regular client command commands won't be picked up trhough typing commands in the dedicated server, because it ain't a client command anymore! 

What you might want to do is set up a CVAR like botman does called "sv_bot" which is the command "bot" and you have to type in your bot commands as "bot addbot" in the dedicated server to add a bot. 

Making up server command functions is easier e.g.

// somewhere like in GameDllInit function
(*g_engfuncs.pfnAddServerCommand)("mybot", MyBot_ServerCommand);

if using metmod you can put it in the meta_ttach function.

And you'll need a function like :

void MyBot_ServerCommand ( void )
{
  char *pcmd = CMD_ARGV(1);
  char *arg1 = CMD_ARGV(2);
  char *arg2 = CMD_ARGV(3);
  char *arg3 = CMD_ARGV(4);
  char *arg4 = CMD_ARGV(5);

  // do whatever you want depending on the command (pcmd) 
  // and arguments (arg1 - arg4)

}

Yep, like Cheesemonster said, the only significant difference is that you don't have a client in a dedicated server, so you can't use the ClientCommand() function to issue commands.

You can use the pfnAddServerCommand() to register your own command and handle arguments the exact same way that ClientCommand() would.  So you could create a server command called "bot" that does everything.  "bot addbot" would add a bot.  "bot setskill" would set the default skill level.  "bot kickall" would kick all bots, etc.

You can issue these server commands from the dedicated server console, or you can use an 'rcon' interface to send these commands from another machine to the dedicated server.

The only other big difference between a dedicated server and a listen server is that you can't actually see what the bots are doing unless you connect with another client to observe them.
