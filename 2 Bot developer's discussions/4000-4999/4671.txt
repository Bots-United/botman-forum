I ripped some code out of the metamod source and modified it to fix the hitboxes issue. Is there any way to check if the hitboxes issue fixed or not for my bot?

The hitbox issue is mostly effected when a player is in motion (crouching, jumping, etc.) since the 9-way blending is used to blend between 2 different animations.

You'd have to have some way of having players jumping or crouching and someone aiming at them to be sure they are are getting headshots when shooting them in the head.  Not an easy thing to do.

The best way to tell is just to play some games with the bots and see if you are getting headshots when you think you should be.  Things will more than likely either work properly, or not work at all.  If you're getting any heads shots then things are probably fine.
