[I've checked and can't find this one mentioned before on the forum]

I'm using the latest version of HPB-bot 2.1a, HL SDK 2.3 and VC++ 6.0

I've been playing around with the HPB-bot in TFC for quite a while now, adding in extra code, links out to external software etc - no problems at all.  

I've now moved on to trying to get the HPB-bot into an unsupported mod - and I'm getting a wierd problem when the bots try to send Client Commands.

We've been trying to get Civilian 'monsters' and 'bots' into a Counterstrike style mod.

We've created a civilian.dll metamod plugin, based on Botman's monster plugin.  Then we use AdminMod to allow us to load the HPB-bots in addition to the metamod plugins - using the localinfo command.

We threw it all into TFC, just to make sure it was all ok -  and it works fine - civilians and bots - all running happily on top of meta/admin mod.

We created a version of metamod which supported our new mod - and the civilian plugin works fine within the new mod.

I worked through the HPB-bot readme to add in support for the mod - and that went OK - up to a point :)

The bots will load into the game - all the configs are read in correctly, it finds the mod's dll - they join the game and start off as spectators (and hurl random taunts around).

When I followed the instructions for handling Client Commands I found that the mod uses the following command to join the game:

join_game team class      team and class are ints ranging from 1 to 3

When the bots send the same command I get:

FakeClientCommand=join_game 1 1
ClientCommand: join_game 1 1
pfnMessageBegin: edict=58b6a40 dest=1 type=77
pfnWriteByte: 2
pfnWriteString: Unknown command: L=млL=млL=млл=млл=млл=

pfnMessageEnd:

Message type 77 is TextMsg for this mod, according to pfnRegUserMsg.

So for some reason the mod is claiming to recieve garbage.

When players send that command it's fine, it's just the bots.

I've checked pages and pages of debug and I can't see any difference between what the bots are doing and what the player is doing.


I also tried it with the command 'disconnect' to make sure the command wasn't going straight into the engine and bypassing the mod dll, and I get exactly the same response.  

No matter what command I try and send the server replies with exactly the same complaint (and the wierd chars L=I..... are always the same).  ... and the edict matches the bot that sent the command.

I've tried my HPB-bot variant under TFC and it runs fine - so it's not something that I've screwed up while adding in support for the new mod.

I must've missed something obvious.   I've reread the readme a couple of times, but I can't see any steps I left out.

Any clues ?

Show the code you are using to send the string to FakeClientCommand().

Fixed it  :)

Sorry about wasting your time.

Turned out the mod developers had redone some of the FakeClient code to put in a 'replay' facility.

... and in doing so had broken the FakeClientCommand()

All works fine now  :)
