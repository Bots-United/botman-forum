Subject: Spawning/Giving an entity

I was wondering if there was a way I could give an entity (weapon) to a player? I was hoping there was a way to do it without dropping it on there head, but as far as I can tell this is the only way to do it.

If I did want to just spawn an entity out of nowhere, how would I do that? There seem to be functions to create entities by class name but either I did something wrong or they don't work the way I thought they would.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated,
Ian

If you download the Half Life SDK you will find a function in there called GiveNamedItem() If you explore this you will be able to give the player a weapon during the game. Unfortuneately, i don't have the SDK on this PC, so i can't help much more...


Sorry for my somewhat lack of help, but this is all i can give you at this point in time...

GiveNamedItem() requires you to have the source code to the MOD.  It won't work for plugin modules.

You have to drop an item on someone to give them that item because the Touch() function for an item won't be called until the player travels through the bounding box of the item.  If you just spawn an item in the middle of the players body, they haven't crossed the bounding box for that item (since they haven't moved into it).  When they move outside of the bounding box of the item, they still haven't touched it (since Touch is only called when an entity moves INTO another entity not OUT OF another entity).

Spawning an item over their head, uses gravity to drop the item down onto the player and the player Touch()es the item since one of the entities has crossed into the bounding box of another entity (in this case the weapon touched the player's bounding box and vice versa).

that was just how players were given the weapons they bought in early Counter-Strike releases. You only needed to run backwards while buying to get two nades for the price of one ;D

I'm at work but all I can think of is how could I pass a weapon on to a player without having to drop it on there head! I know that I would have to rebuild for each version, but does anyone think it would be possible to give a player a weapon using the players private data?

The player's private data is what it means, a private data field. You can't access to the variables inside it unless you have the source code of the MOD and of course, know exactly at which offset from the base pointer these variables are located. Some people do attempt dangerous tricks, such as patching it on the fly to give players more money in Counter-Strike, but it's highly unreliable, and be certain that as soon as a new version of your MOD is out, all that your trick (which was maybe working beforehand) will do, very likely, is a server crash.
