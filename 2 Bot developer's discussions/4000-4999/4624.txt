How to trace the bullets, and optionally make a nice beam for them?

Look in the PodFix plugin I made how I trace bullets fired by players to disallow damage to hostages

Hint: hook pfnTraceline together with IN_ATTACK.

I have yet to make a beam draw for my bots when playing on a dedicated server. Anyone know how to get this to work? I have plenty of examples that work only when playing locally, but I have found no examples of how to do it from a dedicated server when playing remotely.

Just send the beam effect to the client edict that you want to see the beams on (via MessageBegin, MessageEnd, etc.).

Still don't get it... :/

What I want is to draw the tracer not origin->target but the actual bullet fired.

You can't draw the "bullet" if that's what you mean. Projectiles like this don't exist in the game for the engine. When a player fires a bullet, the engine plays an animation, draws a muzzle flash, plays a fancy sound, and fires a TraceLine from this player's entity view point in the direction he is facing. If the TraceLine hit something, then the engine displays a nice gunshot decal. And if it hits a player, some blood, and it makes the victim lower his health.

To botmeister: you can very simply draw beams for whatever client, just decide not to send the message to listenserver_edict (or pListenserverEntity or whatever), but instead to a client of your choice. Notice how the listenserver_edict pointer gets attributed an address and instead of catching the client who is connecting from the loopback, catch another one given its IP address. All is in ClientConnect().

Well if the engine fires TraceLine then there must be some way of intercepting it....or not?

That's what I am telling you: look in the PodFix plugin source code to see how I did it.

And that's what I don't understand -_-; Need more examples...

Or do you know how to run Metamod with a bot (listenserver)?

I tried sending a broadcast message to all clients to draw the beam which did not work. I'll try a loop through the clients and send the message individually instead. Thanks for the help guys.

I hacked metamod to make it run with listenservers here:

a hack to run bots with metamod on a listenserver ? and why does it run here without that hack ? maybe because my metamod version is pretty old ( almost a month I think ) ?!

No, in fact the hack enables metamod to run on single player listenservers too (so that you can use your favourite plugins while playing the Half-Life storyline, for example).

It's the same fix than in botman's bot to get the exports array working correctly.

I'm sorry but how do you use your Metamod with a non-metamod bot? I usually started a closed LAN game to test my bots, but you can't add both dlls to liblist.gam do you?
