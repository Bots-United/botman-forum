Hi

I want to get rid of my response curves that I use for weapon selection and replace them by simple 2nd order polynoms. What made me decide to do so is the following thought:
-The main advantage of a response curve is that it's simple to configure and it allows complex curves modelization. The drawback is that it's a bit slow to compute a value out of it (you need to compute the equation for the line that represents the bucket your input data fits in, then compute again the final value using that equation)
-The main advantage of a 2nd order polynom is that it's VERY fast to compute a value out of it (just feed the input value inside the equation and look at the output), but the main drawback is that it's not "user-friendly" when it comes to figuring out the equation to have the curve look some way.

Since weapon selection is a very periodical process, and that the curves that need to be depicted actually just look like polynoms, and finally, that once the equations for describing the weapons' worths are set they are not likely to change ever, I suppose it's fine to use polynoms instead of response curves, to save a bit of CPU time.

But now I need a software to help me out figuring out my equations for each of my weapons. Something that would compute a polynom equation for me if I tell him 3 points on a graph. I tried to work out some using my trusty calculator, but got a headache before having anything useful.

Google doesn't help me much. Do you know such a software ? (don't tell me about matlab, I want something much more simple)...

nm, found it.
It's my grasp of the english language: didn't know that "computing curve equation from graph points" was in fact simply called "curve fitting", and Google seems to like this one much better than the former one :)
