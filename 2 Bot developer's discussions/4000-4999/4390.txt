This is the code as it is at the moment:

if (!IsAlive (pBot->pEdict))
   {
      BotReset (pBot);                                                   if (pBot->pKillerEntity != NULL)
                                                  {
                                                       if (RANDOM_LONG (1, 100) <= (56 - 2 * gpGlobals->maxClients))
                                                       {
                                                            pBot->BotChat.b_saytext_killed = TRUE;
                                                            pBot->f_bot_saytext_time = gpGlobals->time + RANDOM_FLOAT (5.0, 10.0);
                                                       }
                                                  }
         pBot->pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK;
      
      g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove (pBot->pEdict, Vector (0, 0, 0), 0, 0, 0, pBot->pEdict->v.button, 0, pBot->msecval);
      return;
   };

Respawning for Bots is dealt with exactly the same way as regular players right? I.e. clicking the mouse would respawn you, but i don't understand why the just don't respawn, even when i enable Force Respawn...could there be a problem with the map? then again i don't seem to have problems respawning on the map :\

This part...
code:
pBot->pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK; 

g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove (pBot->pEdict, Vector (0, 0, 0), 0, 0, 0, pBot->pEdict->v.button, 0, pBot->msecval);

...constantly keeps the FIRE button pressed (just like holding the mouse button down all the time).

You will probably need to press AND RELEASE the mouse button for the MOD to respawn the player.  Try something like this instead...
code:
if (RANDOM_LONG(1,100) < 50)
   pBot->pEdict->v.button = IN_ATTACK;
else
   pBot->pEdict->v.button = 0;
      
g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove (pBot->pEdict, Vector (0, 0, 0), 0, 0, 0, pBot->pEdict->v.button, 0, pBot->msecval);
