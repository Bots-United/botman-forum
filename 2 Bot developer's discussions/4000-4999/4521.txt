Hi,

My bots is looking down into the ground then they are running around. How do I fix it so they look straight forward as the HPB bot does ?

Set the view pitch (pEdict->v.v_angle.x or pev->v_angle.x) to zero to make them look straight out horizonatally when there isn't an enemy that they are aiming at.
