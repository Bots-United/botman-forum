Heya there !

Don't you hate when your bots don't see that player hiding behind some crate where a good half of his ass can be seen from the edge ?

Don't you hate when your bots happily run to death because of an ambushed player of which everyone BUT your bot could have seen the silencer of his M4A1 saying "hello" at the corner ?

Don't you hate when your bots steady their sniper rifle and pretend to aim accurately two centimeters too far of their target's ear, miss it of course, but try back over and over again, because someone named "v.origin + v.offset" told them they have to aim RIGHT THERE ?

Hey !!

I wonder why no one took care about it earlier.
Your Jesuz Christ calls himself :
code:

pfnGetBonePosition (pPlayerEntity, bone_index, v_origin, v_angles);



It gives you the ORIGIN of whatever bone you want to check for (head, right foot, left arm, little finger of the right arm)
And more than this it gives you its DIRECTION.
You can make your bots actually SEE whatever fookin' inch of a player hiding around. Watch your asses !

Halleluyah !

wahay, I was also wondering how to do this, but I was thinking all this CPU intensive stuff :P :)

EDIT:

How do you actually know how many bones the edict has?

First is obviously you want to do this with player entities only, possibly for monsters too but in this case you would have to know which bones are different.

Second, you have to test :P
Since you don't have the source code of your MOD, I suggest you run a couple tests with drawing beams and such in order to actually locate the bones on the player model in the game. Fire up one bot, and make it display one of its bones with some DrawBeam function.

Then, all you have to do is something like that:
#define CS_PLAYER_BONE_PELVIS 0
#define CS_PLAYER_BONE_BACK1 1
#define CS_PLAYER_BONE_RIGHT_FOREARM 17
etc...

the bones should also be displayed in a .mdl viewer ...

Also, don't forget that every traceline you do will cost CPU cycles.  You don't want to trace lines to every single bone in every single player every single frame.  Your frame rate will drop to 2 FPS and you'll only be able to have about 3 bots playing in the game at once.

Since most of the time you aren't going to be able to see/shoot players, you should do simple checks first then get into more complicated checks.  Set up a function something like this...

1) Check to see if the origin is outside the field of view by more than 10 degeees, if so, the player can't possibly be visible, return to caller.

2) Check to see if the origin of the player or any of the 8 corners of the bounding box are visible (within FOV and traceline success), if not, the player probably isn't visible, return to caller.  You can't tell 100% sure that some upper or lower part of the player isn't visible, but it will catch most cases.

3) Check to see if any of the bones of the player model (and/or player's weapon model?) are visible (just tracelines here since you know the origin is already within FOV from the previous check).

You might also only want to do these checks every 1/10th of a second or so, instead of doing them every frame.  This should give you a few more CPU cycles to spend on pathfinding and video rendering.

way ahead of ya botman ;) I only check this for players within fov every 0.2 - 0.5 seconds, anyway to the neat stuff...

Heres how to get number of bones, the stuidhdr also holds lots more neat info on an edict. You'll also need the studiohdr structure defined below here

code:

hey thanks a lot Cheesy, that's a good idea this studiohdr thing.

And to botman: of course, common sense rule here. When it comes to checking for the visibility of a player, I only check for 5 bones, by order of tactical importance: head, then the "standard" origin, left arm, right arm, left foot, right foot.

I check the whole 'shebang' as they say here!

code:

bool PlayerIsVisible ( edict_t *pSource, edict_t *pPlayer )
{
      Vector v_origin, v_angles;
      Vector v_src;
      TraceResult tr;

      int iBoneIndex;
      int iNumBones;

      bool bVisible;

      v_src = GetGunPosition(pSource); // Get View Pos

      iBoneIndex = 0;
      iNumBones = GetNumBones(pPlayer); // Get Amount of Bones

      bVisible = FALSE;

      while ( (iBoneIndex < iNumBones) && !bVisible ) // Loop Through Bones
      {
            pfnGetBonePosition(pPlayer,iBoneIndex,v_origin,v_angles);

            if ( FInViewCone(&v_origin,pSource) ) // If in FOV
            {
                  UTIL_TraceLine(v_src,v_origin,ignore_monsters,ignore_glass,NULL,&tr);
                  
                  bVisible = tr.flFraction >= 1.0;
            }
            
            iBoneIndex++;
      }

      return bVisible;
}



and it works! My bots shoot my ass a lot now ;) You know what I mean hehe (Like when I can't see them, they can still shoot me !)

you may better return the actual vector where the bot should aim at, else it will still aim for the center of your body only even if what it sees is just the hand. And you know, a player has ~50 bones, aren't 50 tracelines way too much ? I am however famous amongst bot coders for my personal love story with them, but really here I think you abuse ! ;)

there are 32 with the mod I use. which yeah are a bit many tracelines, but then I do them when all the visibles are being found. And yea I was gonna return the position for the bot to aim at, but I thought I'd better not, because I've got bots to shoot me anyway without it, plus, I want to give the bots a less perfect aiming system so they miss a bit more often rather than just hit the position when they see it :P

I add all the entities the bot can see into a linked list and update it every "gpGlobals->Time + reaction_time), so then when I'm looking for things that are visible, I cans search through the list instead of using mores tracelines per frame. I hope it cuts done my CPU anyway, although when you look for things to add, I use FindEntityInSphere, and the distance is big, but those are cut down by checking if things are drawn (effects & EF_NODRAW etc) and making sure its in FOV first before doing tracelines.

I also only do the GetBonePosition check for players only.

I update them like this :S
code:

if( (last_update_visibles + reaction_time) < gpGlobals->time )
{
...
      visible_list = DestroyList(visible_list);       
...

      while( (entity = UTIL_FindEntityInSphere(entity,pEdict->v.origin + pEdict->v.view_ofs,f_view_distance)) != NULL )
      {   
            origin = VecBModelOrigin(entity);
            
            if( pEdict->v.effects & EF_NODRAW ) // not visible
                  continue;
            else if( pEdict->v.flags & FL_KILLME )
                  continue;
            ...
            else if ( entity == pEdict )
                  continue;
            else if ( (is_player = (entity->v.flags & FL_CLIENT)) == FL_CLIENT )
            {
                  if ( !PlayerIsVisible(pEdict,entity) )
                        continue;
            }
            else if( !FInViewCone(&origin,pEdict) )//UTIL_AnglesBetweenEdicts(pEdict, entity) > 55.0 )
                  continue;
            else if( !EntityIsVisible(this,entity) )
                  continue;
            
            distance = DistanceFrom(origin);            
            
            ...
            
            if ( entity == pBotEnemy )
                  bEnemyVisible = TRUE;
            
            ...

            visible_list = AddToBotList(visible_list, entity);
      }
      
      last_update_visibles = gpGlobals->time;            
}

It seems to me that your reaction time implementation is kinda weird...
Let's say you have a reaction time of 0.3 second
Let's say the last bot scan was at global time = 20 second
Let's say a player actually appears in the bot's FOV at global time = 20.299 second
At 20.3 second, your bot will already have noticed it ???

Yeah I'm an integrist ;D

yeah that's how its meant to be done ;)

although I'm still a bit worried about the amount of tracelines getting used when I update the visibles because of the amount of entities in such a distance (typically around 2048 units - 3000 units in FOV) :/

ah, well if you want less trace lines being called, theirs always one more check you can use

code:

//v_origin is the origin of the entity we want to check..
//might want to check the 4 corners of bounding hulls though

unsigned char *pvs,*pas;
pvs=NULL;
pas=NULL;
SetupVisibility(NULL,bots[bot_index].pEdict,&pvs,&pas);
if(ENGINE_CHECK_VISIBILITY( (const struct edict_s *)bots[bot_index].pEdict, ENGINE_SET_PVS ( (float *)&v_origin ) ))
{
//in the game engines visibility set
}



I asume its quicker than a traceline, so it should save some cpu time, getting rid of redundant checks :D
prolly best to call after the FOV check

another thought might be to limit the number of tracelines per frame...load balancing I think

a traceline wants to be called...so its posted on a list, with its post time..
only some of the list is processed per frame.
and the results get posted back to wherever

the only problem arrises when the system has a low fps, or their are hundreds of tracelines.
so you have to check the trace line was called within 0.1/0.25 seconds, so things don't get backed up

you can have it go adaptive aswell. if it starts backing up, adjust the number of traces per frame allowed :)

I love optomising stuff :D

I already tried to "load-balance" tracelines, only allowing a certain number to be done per frame, so as "filtering" the function call...
Curiously it dropped my fps so much that the game was less playable than without any load-balancing at all.

€dited :

Also, I remember having read something about the PVS...
The PVS is only declared "valid" by the engine if the target entity has been actually SEEN by a REAL player. The engine used this in order for the monsters to start fighting (for example scenes with aliens vs grunts) when and only when the player was around (else the player would only have found corpses during his progression). I think it's the same for bots, in the sense that bots are not real clients, and thus they won't behave right UNTIL a real player "sees" them (either by spectator camera, or in the game). That's why I don't use it.

hmmm, better check these things out then

you may be right about the PVS, as the dam light level was never set unless a real player could see the bot, so it may be the same with the PVS

alternativly, the SetupVisibility may fix the lgihting problem :p

so I'll check that aswell

hmmm, wonder if they've fixed this for CS:CZ, as if the bots don't check lighting levels, it'll suck
heh


I have used this for the PAS though, and it seemed to work pretty well...better do some testing with only a bot on the server


interesting about the load balancing.
perhaps try it with less traces per frame?
hmm, wonder if theirs some querks we don't know about that makes it faster to call lots at once?

nope, the PVS check seems fine!
havn't tested it extencivly...i.e. how well it works in all situations

but it seems to work fine with the tests I've run, so should work well as a traceline filter :D

nice idea tom, I've used it instead of the traceline check, although I've seen some situations were bots tried to shoot thorugh some things, but they were nearby which meant they bumped into each other anyway ;)

I'll keep testing it too ;)

For those who are interested, here's my implementation:

Vector WhatBotSeesOfEntity (bot_t *pBot, entity_t *pEntity)

   // this function returns the best vector the bot pointed to by pBot can see of entity pEntity,
   // and in case pEntity is definitely not visible from the bot's point of view, it returns a
   // NULL vector. Either the entity is a player, or a bounded entity, or a point-based entity.
   // if it's a player, checks are made on different points of the player's body, starting from
   // the most tactically important one (the head) to the less tactically important ones, in
   // order to determine if the player is visible and WHAT is visible of this player ; if it's
   // an entity which has a bounding box, we check whether either the center of it, or any of
   // its four corners on a flattened referential, are visible, and if none of these points are,
   // we assume that the entity isn't visible at all. Else if it's a point-based entity, all we
   // can check is the visibility of the center (origin) of this entity. In case some part of
   // pEntity is visible from the bot's point of view, the vector position of the best visible
   // point of pEntity is returned.

   static TraceResult tr;
   static Vector v_source, v_targetorigin, v_targetside, v_targetangles;

   if (IsNull (pBot->pEntity)  IsNull (pEntity))
      return (VecNULL); // reliability check

   v_source = EyeOriginOf (pBot->pEntity); // compute source vector location

   // is the target entity a player ?
   if (IsAPlayer (pEntity))
   {
      // always look for the player's head first
      v_targetorigin = EyeOriginOf (pEntity); // compute target head vector location
      pfnTraceLine (v_source, v_targetorigin, 0x101, pEntity, &tr);
      if ((tr.flFraction == 1.0) && IsInFOV (pBot->pEntity, v_targetorigin))
         return (v_targetorigin); // head of target player is visible

      // else look for the player's waist
      pfnGetBonePosition (pEntity, PLAYERBONE_PELVIS, v_targetside, v_targetangles);
      pfnTraceLine (v_source, v_targetside, 0x101, pEntity, &tr);

         return (v_targetside); // body of target player is visible

      pfnGetBonePosition (pEntity, PLAYERBONE_R_FOREARM, v_targetside, v_targetangles);

      if ((tr.flFraction == 1.0) && IsInFOV (pBot->pEntity, v_targetside))
         return (v_targetside); // right arm of target player is visible

I don't use EngineSetPVS and EngineCheckVisibility because I've found strictly no documentation on it and thus don't know reliably what it does *exactly*, when it is supposed to work and when it is not. If you know it, please tell me.

Hint: in order to get all the bones index numbers for a model in a specific MOD and their names, there's a simple trick. Open Milkshape3D, use Tools->Half-Life->Decompile Normal HL MDL file, select a player model, and decompile the References and QC files. Then open the generated files with Notepad... 8)

well, have you ever looked at halflife in software mode with the faces being displayed in reverse order?..showing the faces around corners

basically, if your stood somewhere, this tells you what may possible be visible...
so, it should help reduce the amount of tracelines you need todo

obviously, it can't be used instead of a traceline, as its inacurate...it'll say stuffs visible thats hidden round a corner
basically everything that the renderer shows

their are some cases (very rare) where it may fail..
have you seen maps with wholes in them before? where the face isn't shown..that may screw stuff up, as stuff in plane view may not be seen in that case..heh
have to test that

Just when I thought everybody would already use  ENGINE_CHECK_VISIBILITY since years. Sorry couldn't resist ;)
As Tom said using the PAS & PVS is a good way to filter out players so you can skip a lot of slow traceline checks. I'd think it walks the BSP Leafs to do so and it's really fast (but unreliable as well). Remember that you can also use the PAS (Player Audible Set) to skip player checks when listening for sounds.
@ PM: Shouldn't your FOV test go before the traceline check ? :)

If you widen the FOV by about 10 degrees, you can check if an entity is within the wider FOV before doing the traceline.  Calculating the Dot Product of 2 vectors to check if an entity is within the field of view is MUCH more CPU friendly than doing the traceline first.

You're right, but since I can't tell how large the so-said entity is, it can't be much reliable.

For example, large bounded entities such as bomb sites, rescue zones, capture points, won't be necessarily caught by your method. You can thus have the bot pass 2 meters aside of a capture point and don't even notice it.

This should be simple...
As your checking bone positions...check that the line for the traceline is in the FOV _before_ doing a traceline to it :p

as to other entities....
check their 8corners with FOV first :p
if atleast 1 is in the FOV, then its prolly visible

just outa curiosity, does any one know how much CPU the DotProduct takes up, and how much, UTIL_VectorToAngle does... (is it as expensive as SqrRt?)
was going to replace the FOV test with a square FOV test (not a cone)..using the vec to angle
so its more similar to the players screen :p
hehe


Hey Count, had any problems with PVS before? just wondering
I did use the PAS test for audio checks, works well..unless your testing the center of a door, that just opened and left the map
hehe
better check its corners really

The weapon bone, actually, i.e the point that is at the extremity of the weapon (and that the engine uses as the player's GetGunPosition())

Currently it sucks that our GetGunPosition() returns the view offset, because it's plain wrong and unsynchronized with what the MOD DLL itself returns.

Like it or not but the engine actually uses the view offset just as we do. HL and derieved MODs lets players shoot bullets "with their nose", the animation at the end of the weapon barrel is just an illusion. The first position of a 'virtual' bullet in the world could look like:
code:

UTIL_MakeVectors( m_pPlayer->pev->v_angle );

Vector vecSrc = m_pPlayer->GetGunPosition( ) + gpGlobals->v_forward * 16 + gpGlobals->v_right * ( m_pPlayer->m_bLeftHanded ? -8 : 8 ) + gpGlobals->v_up;      // up * -8



Note that this is just for the illusion, the real traceline for the bullet would go from the inside of your players head to the target just as we do now.
  
Did you notice that there is a totally different setup of bones for every weapon ? Some having just 1 bone in the center, some do have a huge count of bones but most of them don't have a bone at the barrel (and why should they in first place?). I'd think that if you desire to have a visibility check for weapons (if that's what you want), you'd either check if the bounding box of the weapon is visible or get the attachment positions of the player and check if those are visible.

Ah, I just can't believe that !

Countless times I was ducking behind a crate and my crosshair was pointing ABOVE the crate, and when I fired my gun it would put bullet hole decals ON the crate... and of course I missed my target.

And believe it or not, but I am prolly unable to get the bounding box of an entity which has none :D

You're just visually challenged :)
No seriously, I think you forgot about the punchangle added to the aiming direction AND the random gaussian spread AND current accuracy modifier applied to each bullets position so it can (read: it will) easily happen that a bullet starts from a different position. 
Btw. you can lookup how decals of gunshots are created in the regular HL SDK, it's not like it is low-level engine stuff or something.

The bounding box of a player is always the same (and always axial), regardless the enormity of the weapon the player is holding in his hands. And the weapons themselves, as being carried by the player, have no bounding box defined in their entvars... your idea won't work.

What about this (if pev-size is reliable for weapons, you could use that instead of the hardcoded Size Table):

code:

edict_t *pPlayer  // the player entity
float fMaxWeaponSize = fParamSize // fed from Table with Weapon Sizes  
UTIL_MakeVectors(pPlayer->v.v_angle);
Vector vecView = GetGunPosition(pPlayer);
Vector vecBarrelEnd = vecView + gpGlobals->v_forward * 16.0f  // to get assumed weapon pos start
vecBarrelEnd = vecBarrelEnd + gpGlobals->v_forward * fMaxWeaponSize;
...
Check if vecBarrelEnd is visible
...

There is no such bone as "eye" in a model. The pent->v.offset *IS* the origin of the monster/player's view point. Using it can also save you a pfn function call since you just have to add two vectors.

This has been already discussed here in this thread.
A working solution is to use a weapon size lookup table ; the weapons DO have bones, but they are not merged with the player's bones. In short, there is no such bone as 'end of weapon rifle' in a *player's* model.

In the P_x model there are just 1 bone from what I have seen when modelling.
It is only there to make the Idle animation work, nothing else.

What I'd like to do, is get a bot to aim for a particular hitbox rather than try and estimate where the hitbox is.

With a bone to hitbox mapping (or visa versa) you can tell your bot to aim for a specific hitbox. You can of course do the same thing by aiming at a specific bone but it would be more natural to have a bot aim at a hitbox location decided on by selecting the correct bone. If there is more than one bone for a hitbox than it would randomly select one of the bones in the hitbox.

Note that the trace_line function will tell you what hitbox group has been located. This way you can tell if your bot is aiming correctly before firing the weapon.

If anyone has the bone indexes mapped out for cstrike player models please post them.

Here's some info on bones and hitboxes that I found which may be of interest http://www.summerblue.net/games/cs_report/1_1_introduction.html

Holy shit that was fast! Thanks PMB!

I modified my initial post to mention that the trace_line function will tell you what hitbox has been located, this should be a very fast way to decide when your bot is actually aiming where you want it to aim.

If everything works, then hopefully I can have bots aim accurately. Using current methods I get cases where the bot will seem to get confused and aim incorrectly at the target, or it will actually point at the target but the aiming system tells the bot there's nothing to shoot at.

This is a very interesting hint indeed! To my shame I must say that I completely forgot it, but now here's the time to change a couple of things in my aiming code then :D

Is there already a bot out there that has such a control in its aiming system ? Wild guess: none (who will tell me I am mistaken ?)

There will soon enough! I'm working on it tonight. You should check out my sniping system. I've managed to get the bots to reliably zoom in and out, along with delays to wait for the zoom to fully complete before firing. Using FOV was a problem, because for weapons like scout and AWP after firing a round, the zoom goes out but the FOV does not change, so a delay was needed to wait for the zoom to come back. You can check it out on my bot server. I also have some nice combat going on now.

One question, what about the missing bone indexes, such as index 8? Are these invalid or just redundant?

All you need is a traceline to determine if the gun is pointing at the desired bone before firing. Why waste a good shot?

As far as I can tell, yes. I don't understand their use though. There's almost 67~70 bones where 20 would have sufficed. Maybe it's to match those of monsters that have a greater number of bones, for example. Dunno. I guess we would need to ask the Valve guys.
