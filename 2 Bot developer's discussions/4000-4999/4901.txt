I had a problem with HPB_bot on FreeBSD. I tried for almost two weeks to get a working bugfree bot like I had before my last disk crash and I had a hard time getting it to work with STEAM and counter strike 1.6 on FreeBSD. I got a surplus of help from these forums, but I had one more problem. It probably did it for you linux wizards too, I dunno. The MIN BOT MAX bot option in the config did not work. The bots would fill the server rendering it useless, and the temporary workaround which was to comment out those lines and add "addbot" lines to the config really sucked because if I changed maps, the bots would not join, so I had to do it manually and even if I did, over time the bots got sleepy and dropped one by one until the server was empty. I got a programming friend, a member of my website to look at the code and fix the bugs. I have the working bugless binary on my FTP server. I also am a sick bastard and overdo EVERYTHING until its perfect so I have both a zip file and a folder in case you want to download one or all of over 560 custom kickass counter strike maps for yourself. I am telling you now dont waste your time or my systems. So be warned. If you leech, and your right, I wont know because I dont need to, you will be immediately blocked by my system's firewall automagically if you have more then the set concurrent connections. Im not telling you how many either so I guess you have to be considerate now dont you. :) Damn 56ker's and your linux box with WGET. And i'm not removing the firewall rule that blocked you because you emailed me and said it was "an accident" Even if you dont want the bot you may want to go snag my HPB_bot_names.txt because I searched the internet for a file of botnames and found one. My text now has around 986 bot names oppose to the stock 10 or so, and they are all fairly cool names. (pinky, tinkerbell, sally.) *kidding. Although small this is my gift for everyone who helped me get this going on these forums, and the multitude of people who will come here looking for help with this because they know as well as I do HPB_bot is the best and they want it, so hopefully they will see this and it will save them a lot of time. Dont get me wrong, the bots are not much smarter then a "top of the shelf" box of dirt, they run around like an ethiopian with a lunch ticket and run into walls like a blind man in a blazing house fire, but they are fun for me none the less because quite frankly, I suck. If I were to play online I would get beat down like a red headed midget stepchild by a bunch of ten year olds with nothing better to do then play on mommys damn compaq all day. (Christ at least I hope they would be kids with all that free time.) and with that, download and enjoy. And BotMan thank you for giving us this great gift, and it bothers me that you no longer support it because I know with you on the job it would only get better but I fully understand and that was rather nice of you to have it be open source to help that factor out. At least I have a working bot now that you bet your ass I already burned on CDR with all the maps etc. And now I share it with all of you. I wont be on these forums anymore because well duh? I dont needem. The stuff be fixed. :) So if you want to get ahold of me for whatever reason, love letters, death threats, preferably death threats cause love is just no fun, go to my website, hit irc.unixhideout.com #unixhideout or do it the old fashioned way and email me. One last thing. You definitely want to read my README I have in the directory. You will most likely want to edit the HPB_bot_chat.txt file as I am a twisted bastard and I have the bots say some not so nice evilbadscary things, and because it was for my server it spams my website and my irc network a few times which obviously you could and should remove using your fav text editor. Enjoy, play fair, kill people. And with no further ado.. Damn html dont work on this forum?

y'know, it would have been even better to post the code changes... Just make a diff of the new source code with the previous one, and dump the output here.

He went to sleep but I'll ask him tomorrow first thing. Does linux have a recycle bin? Maybe he hasn't emptied it. *chuckles* I dont program so I had no use for the code. Not to mention I couldn't mess with it and compile it if I wanted to cause all I have is my beloved FreeBSD. He compiled it on GENTOO linux. I need to get my ass a linux box. Even if I get a hard drive and plopped linux on it and dropped it in my box when I wanted to boot it. I did that before but the only hard drive I have "hanging around" now thats worth a stamp is used to ghost windows so im not reinstalling every god damn week. I just ghost the drive whenever I make significant changes to the system and its not pissing and whining at me. Works great, I cant remember the last time I reinstalled. I cant believe I didnt think of that and I do apologize for being so selfish. I guess I was just so happy to finally have a working binary. That would have been smart of me though wouldnt it heh.. I hope he still has it. I wanted to play a game of counter strike but he said his network at college has some virus and its as slow as windows NT running a java app because of it. (actually, thats my line but he used it the uncreative bastard.) As a result, I told him he was a bitch and would just blame his massive beating on lag anyway. (he probably would have kicked my ass with his 1000 ping and my 5 ping but I wont tell him that.) And it worked out OK cause I said I didnt even kick his ass yet and he was blaming lag. That's ok though. Why? Because I have bots to sex0r now.

I apologize for not getting the src when I could have. He says he no longer has it cause he had no use for it and dumped it. I asked if he could redownload the src and do it again so I can upload it for you guys but at that point I do believe he got selfish or something and said why should I fix someone else's code and I am not going to pursue it cause although the kindness of these forums helped me, hes the only one that ultimately got me what I was seeking so I cant complain. If I did that it would be looking a gift horse in the mouth as they say and I dont practice that no more then I practice staring at a rottweiller. I guess we should just be grateful that we have a working bug free binary which is more then anyone else here in these forums or anywhere else on the net for that matter could offer the ones here like me that, when speaking about programming, got the shallow end of the gene pool. I tried the last two weeks of my surfing to get a HPB_bot binary that had fixed these problems and came close with a lot of help but failed none the less. He tried explaining what he did to me too but I laughed at him and said english you bastard do you speak it. (actually it was more vulgar, but there be preschool toys in these forums.) I felt like I was in school again doing a test just trying to understand him. I wanted to slit my wrists and slip in a warm bath with bubbles. I like bubbles. Cant imagine a better way to go. Well. I could but there is the issue of those preschool toys again. I can say it did not take him long. Maybe an hour from the time he downloaded the src off of me until he plopped the binary on my FTP server. I also know he looked at botmans site.  Anyway, I have offered all that I can. Oh by the way. I ended up playing a counter strike game with him. He kept getting his ass beat down by one of my bots and the funniest thing is? the bot that kept slapping him around like a chump was named "schoolgirl" He still kicked my ass with a cheap silenced pistol even though I had a god damn mp5 but my bots whooped his ass So it's all good, and I now have some fuel for any fire his ass wants to try and start with me. haha you got beat by a schoolgirl. Well all of you take care and thanks for your help, enjoy the working binary, and I do believe with that this thread closed.
