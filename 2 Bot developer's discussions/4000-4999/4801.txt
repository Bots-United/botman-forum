You can only create VGUI menus if you have the source code to the MOD.

VGUI menus require changes to the client DLL of the MOD and without the source code to the client DLL, you can't change it.

If you are making a bot for a MOD that you don't have the source code for, you are stuck using the old text style menus (assuming that the MOD supports the old text style menus, which some MODs may not).

Even if the MOD supports VGUI, you CAN'T add your own display code to it.  You can only display what the MOD supports displaying (i.e. NO custom menus).

Unless you have the source code to the MOD, you can't create VGUI menus.

Put it simply, VGUI menus are literally stored on the client. The texts, icons and images in the VGUI menu obviously do not pass through the network when the server tells a client to display such or such menu. And since your bot is a SERVER-SIDE bot only (i.e. your clients don't necessarily have the bot DLL when they play on your server), you simply cannot tell them to display what you want if their client DLL doesn't already know the menu you want them to display.

However, if that mod supports the Command Menu (just like what you see when you strike the H key in Counter-Strike and when you strike SHIFT in Team Fortress), you can add something to the file commandmenu.txt which is located in the MOD directory (for example, c:\sierra\half-life\cstrike\commandmenu.txt)

Yes, but the commandmenu.txt file is read CLIENT-SIDE. Server admins can't force client Bob Smith to display their own modified command menu if Bob Smith has the bare bones unmodified commandmenu.txt. My point still stands :)

However, if you are an admin, will you let your clients to add or remove bot(s) in your server?

Maybe if you are running a linux or dedicated server where the admin cannot be a client.
