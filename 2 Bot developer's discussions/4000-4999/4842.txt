I have a question, not sure if this is the best place or if the metamod forum is better, its more a coding question for hpb_bot so here goes...

Ok so I've built in some in game admin type commands into the hpb_bot that are auth'ed via steamids (formerly wonids). On particular command is a "slap" command which makes a player dizzy like they've been concussion grenaded (tfc conc gren). In addition to the dizzy command I thought it would be neat to spawn a few snarks around this player, so I've added some code to send via a SERVER_COMMAND something like 

sprintf(msg2, "monster snark \"%s\"",
         STRING(INDEXENT(i)->v.netname)
        );

SERVER_COMMAND(msg2);

but I get this in my logs...

Error, bad server command monster snark "[STF]Billy"

Am I doing something wrong? Is the "monster" command not available from inside HPB_bot? I have metamod loading hpb_bot via the localinfo deal. Is there a work around?

SERVER_COMMAND() would only work if pfnAddServerCommand() had been used to register the "monster" command.

You could theoretically move all the "monster" command stuff from ClientCommand() into a new function (let's call it MonsterCommand) and then use pfnAddServerCommand() to register the MonsterCommand() function for the "monster" server command.

Inside the MonsterCommand() function, you can use ARGC and ARGV to get the command line arguments.

Once you've done this, your changes to the HPB bot code should let you do what you originally wanted.

EDIT: Dooooh!  Nevermind, I forgot that the Monster plugin already used the pfnAddServerCommand() to register the "monster" command line command (so that rcon stuff would work properly).  I'm not sure why SERVER_COMMAND("monster") wouldn't give you the proper results.

Just a double check, did you put a '\n' at the end of your string that you pass to SERVER_COMMAND()?
