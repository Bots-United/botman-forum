Redirect the output to a file like this:

exports hl.dll > output.txt

Then you can open output.txt in a text editor.

that's a good idea, but why dont you try with the oldddddd command named more.exe (is in the windows 98 cd)

For more you have to follow the exports output into the input of more, to do this you need to use a pipe, i.e.

exports hl.dll | more

And it will display them all in more without writing to a file or anything

Can't you just use /p or is it \p after the command to stop the scroll at the end of every page? and then spacebar I think to continue with next the next page?
Can't remember exactly been a long time since I did much in DOS ;)

no thats only for viewing the directory ;)

the program must set an argument called /p that will do this
