Hi,

I'll try and keep this brief. I'm studying BSc A.I. and i'm currently in my Final Year, i've decided (can't change now!) to design a relatively simple Bot for Half-Life (simply because it has such a huge modding community), i'm fairly good with C++ and since i don't intend to aim as high as creating a super human like bot i'd think it'll suffice.

Now, i just need some advice on whether it's actually a good idea for me to start a Bot in HL? I mean, even though it's a pretty old game by now it's still pretty complex, would working on a even older game like Quake/Quake 2 be a better idea??

Also, can anyone give me decent (recent and NOT dead!) links? Lots of pages i went to all contain dead links, or they haven't been updated for 2-3 years!

All Advice is Appreciated!!

Ak.

Well, to make a bot from scratch, you need to know how Half Life Works. Best way to do this is LOOK at botman's source code for his HPB Bot which is downloadable at http://www.planethalflife.com/botman

AND/OR the Half Life SDK which is downloadable from http://www.voodoofiles.com/4335

 In there it will show you alot of things that you can then implement yourself, but differently.

As for the Game Preference, I think you should stay with Half Life. Bots in Quake (that I have seen) aren't all that intelegent no matter how hard you try. There are a few things the Half Life can do alot Better than the Quake games.

Stick with Half Life :D
