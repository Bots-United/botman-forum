First, thank botman for his great HPB-Bot. It gives me so much fun.
Well...It seems that when the HPB-Bot is running in Oppofing Force CTF mode, they don't want to capture the flag.
I have checked the source code. It seems quite easy to correct this, and, I have already done this. However, botman, I don't know why you didn't do this.

They will capture the flag on maps that have waypoints.  The HPB bot only comes with waypoints for one OpFor CTF map (CRASH).

Maybe some people would be interested in seeing these changes, if you were kind enough to post them here ?

I meant that I found the bots would not capture the flag after a successful capture. What caused that is in Opposing Force, after someone captured the flag, the "v.owner" of the flag entity still remains. So we need more than check pent->v.owner.
We can do it like this to work this around:
if(...... && pent->v.origin == pBot->pEntity->v.origin)

Really ? Didn't notice yet... but now that you say it, I see that even my bots don't pick up the same flag twice... gotta fix that right away, thanks a lot :)
