You may remember that I was once trying to build a complicated texture database in my bot code to know which footstep sound to dispatch when my bots were walking on any texture, and for the right ricochet sounds to be played.

I was reading the materials.txt file myself (this is a file that associates a texture name to a character that describes the type of material the texture is supposed to represent, f.ex. 'C' for concrete, etc.) I was asking the engine for the texture name under the player's feet, using the costy pfnTraceTexture() function, then I was looking for a match with the returned texture name and one or the other slot in my texture database, and given this information, I was able to get the character describing the texture type, and according to it, to tell what footstep sound to play. If you want to look at this complicated code, have a look in my RACC template on my site.

Anyway I've just found out that there is a looooovely function in the gamedll interface that does 80% of this job for me, and much faster than I could possibly do.

PM_FindTextureType() will return a character describing the type of texture the texture name passed as a string pointer represents. No need to build a big database of textures anymore. ANY gamedll is supposed to feature this function, so it's definitely one to use.

This function is very simple to use:
code:

   // pseudocode
    texture_name = TRACE_TEXTURE (from_center_of_player, to_9999_units_below_center_of_player);
    if (NotFound (texture_name))
       GiveUp;
    else {
       texture_type = PM_FindTextureType (texture_name);
       switch (texture_type) {
          default:
          case 'C'
             PlaySound (footstep_sound_concrete);
          case 'N'
             PlaySound (footstep_sound_snow);
          case whatever
             PlaySound (footstep_sound_whatever);
       }
    }



w00tage :D
