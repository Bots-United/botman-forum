What about this?

HL<->BOT.DLL<->MOD.DLL

looks fimiliar? Perhaps it does, except for the fact the BOT.DLL only does what an outside .exe file does. This guy i told about aint giving up, he was talking about sockets and such. Now, i just see this program as just another process to make bots think. This time its detached so you have a seperated think program giving instructions to the bot.dll so it performs for that game the handled instructions. Like a layer. This is not even about writing the same AI for another game.

Again, is this sufficient? possible? buggy? I am total clueless and found the idea quite ambitious and a bit strange. Nevertheless i am wondering if this would be possible...

Yes, that would work.

There are several people that have contacted me about wanting to control Half-Life bots using external applications.  In one case a guy wanted to use a virtual reality glove to control a bots movement.  The glove was connected to a Silicon Graphics workstation and he didn't know how to get the glove input into Half-Life.  I told him to create a Windows socket interface inside the HPB bot code, and create a socket application on the workstation side to send data back and forth over the network.

Make SURE you use non-blocking sockets (use google.com to search for "windows non-blocking sockets") otherwise the game will come to a screeching halt waiting for the network socket to receive data.
