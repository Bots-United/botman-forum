Hey I'm developing some ideas for a major research project for school, and I'm thinking of doing some bot AI stuff, mainly relating to squad tactics etc.. anyhow what I was wondering if there is anything similiar to Gamebots (UT) for half-life?  If you haven't seen Gamebots before, it allows a client application to interface with a server running the game for AI purposes.

I haven't seen anything like this publicly available for Half-Life, but I have been contacted by two or three people over the years that have wanted to do this.

Most times I just recommend that they create their own socket connection to the server and create a plugin (via metamod) that takes commands from a client and uses that to control a fake client (bot) on the server.
