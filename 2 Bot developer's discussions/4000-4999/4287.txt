Are you talking about audio speech (as in spoken words) or text speech?  You can do both.

If you want to do audio speech you need to have ready made audio files and simply play these files either using the EMIT_SOUND functions or "play" client command. And you need to send net messages across if you want to make the message look authentic such as a speaker icon on the screen with the bot name, and the speaker icon above the players head that is speaking. PM has done this in his RACC bot, I guess you could check that out http://www.racc-ai.com

The easiest way to get a bot to talk is using the text messages. You can use botmans UTIL_HostSay in his HPB_bot to get an edict to talk, this is done by sending network messages again but you need to decide who wants to receive the messages and what the full message looks like (even the *DEAD* in counter-strike has to be added using this method and (TEAM) when using team messages)

Another way for text messages is using the client command "say" or "say_team", but this wont work properly with Botman's FakeClientCommand function, again you'll need to look at PM's Racc implementation of FakeClientcommand and GetArgsv etc...
