Subject: building a better tfc bot

Wondering what others have done in the area of TFC (or any team based mod really) to make the bots perform better. I've done some mild hacking in an attempt to improve the bots. 

For example, in bot_navigate.cpp we have some checks that determine if the bot is seeing a flag, if the flag has an owner, whether to attack the flag bearer, or head for the flag (ball?), etc. 

Well if we add on to the end of this checking:

code:

               // check if it matches one of the flags...
               for (i=0; i < num_flags; i++)
               {  
                  // is the flag for this team (or any team)?
                  if ((flags[i].edict == pent) &&
                      ((flags[i].team_no == (team+1)) || (flags[i].team_no == 0)))
                  {  

BUNCH OF CODE


               }
               else
               {
                  // WE SHOULD DEFEND THIS FLAG
               }  



The else would tell us that this flag is not for us to capture or for any team to capture. This means its a flag we should defend. I added code in this area so that bots will first approach the flag. Then when there is no waypoint closer to the bot than the flag is to the bot they will CAMP/DEFEND the area for some random time (30 secs to 3 mins). I also do checking so that only the heavier classes will defend this spot ie hwguys, demomen, soldiers and pyros. 

In another spot in botmans code I see that we do some checking. If sniper the some % of time we will go after the flag (goal item) and the rest of the time we will snipe from a sniper waypoint. Same with engy, go for flags or build/upgrade/repair things. Beyond that it said 40% of the time lets go for flag, other 60% I guess we are wondering around aimlessly... 

I modified this so light classes (scout, spy, medic) will go after the flag a much larger % of time. heavier classes will go after flag much smaller % of time. 

A third modification I made was for heavier classes. This % of time they are not going for the flag I have them find a random sentry gun waypoint. If its a good sentry location it is also a good defense location. The bot then heads to that spot and upon reaching it will CAMP/DEFEND for 30 seconds to 3 mins before moving on. 

These were really quite simple things to code but seem to make a world of difference in how the bots play TFC. Its not teamwork like the foxbot or sturmbot has attempted to implement, but a definate improvement IMHO.

What ideas have others come up with for making these kinds of small improvements to the bots?

I've done a lot of simple "AI patching" like this in my first bot (RACC preview), which happened to show very convincing results from time to time. You may want to have a look at the source code. But remember it was a 100% waypointless bot.

and i would get this source from where? Your website seems to be some kind of anti-American propaganda...

I never stated it was available on my site. You could probably have found it elsewhere on the net.

BTW. You don't read my site correctly, it is no "anti-american" propaganda, I can assure you. Being against a liar and a hypocritical state administration does not mean being against the people who live in, else there would be no more germans on the surface of the planet right now. 
The real site is still down in protest at the moment.

I don't think you and I see eye to eye on *that* subject. I'd be happy to have a discussion with you about it but *this* is not the proper forum for such a debate...
