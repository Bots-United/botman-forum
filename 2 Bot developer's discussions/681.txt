I want to make my bots buy weapons. I know u have to do a FakeClientCommand or whatever. How do i do a fake client command? And where do i do it?

Can botman or some genius point me in the right direction?

What I did (although I've not tried to get the bots to buy weapons yet, just pistol ammo)  was to look at the other examples of FakeClientCommand - look at the code for players joining teams. You should put the buy code somewhere that is only executed at the start of each round (or when a bot is in the buyzone and less than a minute has passed from the start of the round).

You also have to know the actual commands that players use in CS to bring up the buy menu and make their selection. Use the 'bind' command in the console to fing out these commands. For example, 'b' is bound to 'buymenu' and '1' is bound to 'slot1', etc.

The hard part is getting messages from the server to tell you that the menu has been displayed, I don't know how to do this yet. Can anyone else help/expand on what I've said?

I would recommend you use "Search" to look or "buyzone" and "buy" to find examples and discussions about how to buy weapons.  This has been discussed many times before, no sense re-hashing it again here.

If you want the answer to your question, take some time to read the previous threads.  You just might learn something in the process.
