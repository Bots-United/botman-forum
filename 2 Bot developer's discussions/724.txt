First off, Ive decided to make it so my bot doesnt fly and is not retarded :(

Instead, Im going to try to make an intelligent bot.

One of the major thins Im stuck on, is the waypoint system. I hear people saying something about Floyds waypoint algorythm. Where did he post the info on it? 
My bots are working surprisingly well at the moment, the only problem is they dont find the waypoints like they are supposed too. So Im trying to figure out a system to use.

Now, Ive figured out how to get medics to heal you and implemented that in.

I want to implement botmans' team "use" system that he had implemented in his original bot (when you go up to a bot on your team and hit your use key, it will follow you). I examined the code botman had in the sourcecode to his original bot to see how he did it. But when I adapted the code and added it to the bot it gave me a million compiling errors. Help!!!

I think I know how to get the bots to toss grenades, but its a bit buggy. They seem to enjoy spamming with grenades rather than using them wisely. Any suggestions?

Last thing, this isnt a problem but a preview of what Im adding to the bot;
once I have the moving from waypoint-to-waypoint system in, Im going to add a "detpack waypoint". That waypoint will send a signal to bot demomen that they should set a detpack in that location and then get out of there. Im thinking of doing the same kind of system to get engineers building sentry guns.

HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi Matt,

1) Do a search on floyd up the top there.

2) I don't think you can do the use business because you need to extend classes and functionality in c++, but the hpb bot is in mostly c. I got my bots following through typing text messages. You could also have a command that figures out what bot you're aiming at and pops up a command menu. Then bind a key to the command.

3) I haven't tried grenades yet. Doesn't look too hard tho. Looks can be deceptive.

4) With the detpack thing, you chould keep a list of which points have already been used, so they don't bomb them twice. Then, after they are used, they become a valid path for other bots to use. (so you can have a path going through a blocked tunnel that they won't use until it has been bombed). I'm not sure what to do about those pesky human demomen though. 8)

good luck,

Matt, I know you're anxious to get your bot working, but try not to work on too many things at once. :)

Here's the link that I've given other people on using Floyd's algorithm to find a route from one point to another...

http://home.wxs.nl/~faase009/HaFloyds.html

...it's a fairly simple program that prints the path from A to B, B to C, C to D, etc.  You will obviously have to figure out how to convert this to use the waypoint structure included with my bot code (unless you plan to rewrite it as well).

Botman, does it mean that if we type the code into bot.cpp, the bots will be able to follow the waypoints?

You will have to modify the code that is shown in the link I gave to work with the HPB bot waypoint code.  You can't just cut-and-paste it in to get the bot to follow waypoints.
