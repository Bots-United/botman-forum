I just released my waypoint converter program. The website is http://nuclearbox.com/wpc/

It can be used to convert waypoint file from one format (say POD-bot) to another (SWAT-bot for example). See the website (about page) for more info.

Marcus,

question (you probably heard this one before):
if waypoints mean different things to different bots, how useful is it to convert waypoint files between bots?

The number and type of waypoints put into a map are typically derived from the kind of AI the bot developer tries to develop. For example, a bot with poor movement code still functions well if it is given a dense network of waypoints. On the other hand, a bot assuming only few waypoints (because it doesn't precompute a Floyd/Warshall shortest path table) will perform poorly on that same set of dense waypoints.
If waypoints are annotated with 'ambush', 'defuse' etc. flags, things will get more complicated.

In the two years I've been working on my bot, I changed the waypoint format some five times, to accomodate new needs from the AI.

I hope your efforts will pay off, and bring some benefits to CS bot gamers, but I have some doubts.

William

The most important information stored in waypoint files is the position of the wp. That is the same for each bot. 
Regarding flags: most cs bots for example have (or should have :)) flags like bomb spot, hostage position, rescue zone, etc. which can be converted. The flags which aren't supported by both bots (for example, IIRC POD has door waypoints, NNBot ignore waypoints) they can be added manually which is still a lot faster than doing the whole map from scratch.

I guess that's true: POD has a lot more waypoints in a map than SWAT for example. But I don't know if it's a problem.

I already discussed this above.

Its quite easy to change the converter DLL if the format changes, so I don't see that as a problem.

I hope so as well :) But one of the main reasons I made the program is to convert POD files to the format of my own bot, so it certainly 'pays off' for that. I also learnt a lot about (dynamic) DLL loading and stuff :)

Hi Marcus,

thanks (bedankt) for the reply. I had not thought of converting waypoints for personal use, which makes a lot of sense.

Still, another warning. In addition to the waypoint density, you might run into troubles with the waypoint links (valid direct connections from one waypoint to another). At least, my AI is pretty keen on not allowing connections to by-pass a door, and will do suicides if that condition isn't met. (See the http://www.botepidemic.com/aid/cgf/doc_routes1.shtml#doorproblems for an explation).
You can easily handle this problem if bot developers correctly state their AI's assumptions to you.

Take care,

William
