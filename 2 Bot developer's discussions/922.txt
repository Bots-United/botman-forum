Hi
if you want to edit the ingame menu ,just edit the entrys in the "Titles.txt" file in your TFC directory.

I think he means the in-game waypoint menu. Look in dll.cpp and you'll find it in there if you follow the pattern you should be able to add, delete or change the ones already there.

If you want to edit the VGUI menu, just look in the tfc folder at the file called "commandmenu.txt".  Edit this file in your favorite text editor (Notepad, etc.)  It contains comments about how to change things and is pretty self explanitory.  I suggest you save a backup copy of this file before you start changing it.
