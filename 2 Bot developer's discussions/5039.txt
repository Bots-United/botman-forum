--------------------------------------------------
What mean "ONE PERFECT BOT WITH ONE SMALL PROBLEM"? OKAY , LET ME TELL YOU . Today , I spend some time to add more functions and additions to my bots , and I test it , wow , its perfect , very perfect , their navigation is extremely smooth , and they don't need waypoint system to let the bot navigate through the map , when you first use the bot , you can't play with it , you must start a LAN server and let the Terrain Tracking System (I create it !)to scan the whole map and put in waypoint automatically and then it will automatic restart the game and then you can play with the bots ! Their combat movement is good also (not best , since I'm not a PRO coder),they are more human like , and use sniper better than all the bot I try (sorry this may make some bot creater angry),they snipe and shoot , no waiting , if it does not kill the enemy , it change to pistol to protect themself , then they change back to sniper rifle again and try to aim and shoot the enemy (sounds cool , huh ?) , one of the addition to my bot is they will try to finish you with knife if they "see" you run out off ammo or they run out of ammo , one more , when the T plant the bomb , and a CT kill the T and the bomb are going to BOOOOOMM , the CT will run away to a computer generated waypoint called safe-waypoint with knife in hand ! But the DAMM thing is 
"I DON'T HAVE A NAME FOR THIS BOT !!!"
Anyone with suggestion or idea you wish to be added to the bot please reply , and I want to say something here , that is ...

DON'T ASK ME ABOUT WHAT ARE THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE BOT , BECAUSE IT IS VERY TOP TOP SECRET AND CANNOT BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC , SORRY IF THIS WORD MAKE YOU ANGRY OR DISSAPOINTED , BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHARE IDEAS WITH ME , I WILL BE READY AT ALL TIME , WE CAN SHARE OUR IDEAS AT THIS FORUM.THANKS.

****NOTE
I CREATED ALL MY CODE MT SELF , INCLUDING THE TERRAIN TRACKING SYSTEM

Well , I think I will not , it is still under my development and I am still fixing some bug on it ,
When it is done , I will release it (not the source) to public , hey cheese , my keyboard "Caps Lock" key is damage , so I must type in CAP letter , sorry , huh ? the problem ?
I have been said , that is
"I don't have a name for this bot"

hehehe. I see.

Just look for an ordinary name that might end with "OT" or something that ends with "B" and make it say "BOT" at the end!

e.g. instead of Camelot, Camebot!

Don't worry , I won't remember it , but I still cannot think a better name for my bot

Note : My bot like to have frag with knife 

And I want to name the bot base on this special thing of my bot , any clue , botman and cheese ?

slashbot ? it is pretty well , but I still want more idea and combine them to choose the best among them , what is your idea , Botman ???
Or your brain is DEAD , just for fun !

meleebot ? too bad , too ugly , but anyway thanks , cheesemonster , 

Hey , I found a "bug" on my bot , a big DAMM "bug"
"THEY DID NOT GET EFFECT BY FLASHBANG AND SMOKE GRENADE ! HOW TO FIX IT ???"

And later I found one also...

"THEY FIRE THE ELITE (DUAL BERRETAS) LIKE AN MP5 , WOW ,TOO HARD FOR PLAYERS TO BEAT IT ! HOW TO CHANGE IT ALSO ?"

fixing those minor '''''bugs''''' shouldnt be a problem for someone who wrote an almost perfect bot

and if it is still a problem, look at the open source bots :P

I side with Aspirin, it shouldn't be hard for you ;)

for smokegrenades:
Use a few TraceLines() and check for grenades using FindEntityInSphere() or better keep track of grenades as soon as they are launched ; I suppose you know how to use a TraceLine() and a FindEntity() loop if you've written such a perfect bot.

for flashbangs:
hook "ScreenFade" network messages the way the HPB_bot does them, and blind the bots according to the duration of the fade passed in the message. Not a big deal for a genius like you.

I am impatient to see your bot in action. Really. Hehehe.

LethalBot ? MetalBot ? FusionBot ? Sniper Squads ?

Have a little imagination ;)
...oh and work on your credibility, too.

hmm why am i not believing you.... oh you asked last week how to make a bot :) 
So you are able make an almost perfect bot in a whole week W0W! Then I don't see any problems with these missing features(not bugs).
Oh and a tip for your caps.... hold shift to make the letters small again ;)
But yeah you really should post it when its done :)

I know somebody will ask this , as you know , I going on a three day exhibition which teach aall things about C++ , Alghorim and bla bla bla , and maybe I will let my bot in action in a few weeks , so please wait silently , Pierre-Marie Baty and see my excellent job in bot programming ,
and thanks for the bot names !And thanks for your "imagination" , but sorry because I am working on the bot code myself (no people help me !)and I don't want another people see my own top secret source code !

For a name, pick something that's personal to you (that has special meaning for you, maybe something that is like a secret joke or hidden message).

The name doesn't have to end with "bot" or have "bot" in it anywhere.  People will know that it is a bot without having "bot" in the name.

You could call it something like "slash-a-rama" or "evil-slasher" or something like that (if you wanted to go with the knife theme).

If you have a list of 3 or 4 names and you can't choose between them, maybe you could make a Poll thread on the NukeBox website to let other CS players pick the name...

1. Click on "Other Bots" forum.

2. Click on "New Thread".

3. Check the "Yes! post a poll" check box and fill in the number of selections in your poll (the default is 4).

and the capital B ? who can tell why there is no capital B in botman ? ;D

oh sorry, it's maybe "top secret confidential defense" too...

@3colors: I don't doubt a second of your "excellent job in bot programming". I'm awaiting your "exhibition" which will teach us "aall things about C++ , Alghorim and bla bla bla", with great impatience. What pathfinding algorithm are you using in your bot, by the way ?
 Is it Z* or Chebyshev ? me, I'm using a modified Marconi algorithm because I'm a l33t h@x0r. I was told Chebyshev works best. Which one are you using ? :)

"I spend over a month to complete it and you want me to name it like this"

"I going on a three day exhibition which teach aall things about C++ , Alghorim"

This is what i think
1) You are 12 - 14 years old and have ripped Pierre-Marie Baty Bot
2) You are a german that just need 2 feel loved

DAMM you said I'm only 12-14 year old and I ripped
Pierre-Marie Baty Bot , WTF are you kidding , I'm 29 years old , I'm new to C++ I admire , but before this , I am a profesional programer in BASIC , FOXPRO , J++ bla bla bla ... and I only go studying C++ for a few days and I can fully understand the C++ , because I have got good understanding in other programming system , and you said me ripped Pierre-Marie Baty bot , don't worry , after some day of releasing my first bot , I will release the source code to the first bot ,(maybe a good news for bot programmers!),and then I want to see if you are still said I ripped his bot !!!

Hey RedLink , did you know that why I ask that question , because I create the bot system all by myself and it is not based to another bot source 
so maybe I forgot to add some important function like FIND_ENTITY_API() in some of the codes and the game crashes so that is why I ask botman what files are needed to run the mod properly also without the bot code !

RedLink , maybe you don't understand , when I ask that question , I have a almost complete bot code but it have some weird problem and I have no clue
about how to fix it, so I ask botman how to make a bot and mention that I am new to bot
programming so that botman will give me some tips 
(but sadly , no) , after that I visit the link page and I get a bunch of new idea there , then I
combine my code and the idea I found and it works great !!! And Pierre-Marie Baty , as you know , I 
create a whole new pathfinding system by combine the code I found and some of my original code so I have no name for it !!!

AND ONE THING REDLINK 
"I AM NOT FROM GERMAN !!! AND I AM NOT 12-14 YEAR OLD !!!"

Don't yell like this, are we shouting here ?
I *really* don't doubt that you're a good programmer, I was just asking a question.
Is your custom pathfinding algorithm closer to Chebyshev or Marconi ? both are fundamentally different, as you know, but you must have based your work on either of them to build your own pathfinder. Which one have you started with ?

My pathfinding system is base on the Marconi , because my friends (bot programmers) told me that is better and more easier , so I think some part of my pathfinding code is base on the Marconi system , and I am not shouting , but , I like to use CAPS and EXCLAMATION MARK (!!!) so please understand , I am not yelling !

Oh my God.... how... fascinating !

You know, I would never have known that Marconi (a scientist of the beginning of the 20th century who worked on the atom) and Chebyshev (a Russian mathematician who wrote in particular a theory on digital signal filtering) also wrote algorithms for pathfinding, and this, even before computers existed, if I hadn't meet you !


wow.


These scientists rock all, don't you think ? Come closer. I'm gonna whisper a secret in your ear.


The Marconi and Chebyshev algorithms don't exist.

They don't.

Forged them.


Now stop this. Please.
(om*g howdya want to keep your serious with kids like that hehehehe)
