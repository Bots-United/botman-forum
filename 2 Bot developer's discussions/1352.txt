Ive been trying to get back on track with bot coding and ive just picked up on a bug thats been in SWAT for ages. 

When you issue a fakeclientcommand it doesnt appear to always terminate correctly or something.
When I try to change weapons it tells me;

unknown command tf_weapon_knife

and to make it worse none of my command binds will work. I know this is similar to the fakeclientcommand bug fix posted a while back, but even with the fix applied nothing will work.

Its probably why my bots dont appear to always change weapons correctly.

it could be so simple that you only havent defined the tf_weapon_knife

try changing it to cs_weapon_knife

Thats the thing! Im not calling the TF weapon knife!

All that code was commented out, it seems that the memory is not being handled properly since the only place that this string appears actively in my code is the weapon array definition for TFC (which Ive left intact because removing it caused tonnes of errors, plus I want to port over to TFC)

Not just that, but most of the time its a different message and sometimes it actually does a bots actions (i,e. buys armour and a sg) without me saying to.

Its a memory mismanagement.... Thats all I can think off.

check your autoexec.cfg and valve.rc see if they have anything like that in it...

no they dont.

In other news please read what is probably near the top thread on this board "SWAT Bot - Force Recon"
