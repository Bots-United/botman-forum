Last time I played TFC I noticed 3 guys using cheats (SpeedHack etc). Everyone on the server was very upset (me too) and so I thought "Why not try to do something about that?".
So, as the bot programmers have certain control over the HL server with a DLL, why not try to make an Anti-Cheat DLL? Speedhacks and so on would be easy to eliminate (the player moves way to far as possible -> kick).

Yes you can check which weapons a player has and if that weapon isn't possible with that class (tfc) than you can kick the player.

I think that is one of the goals of the Punk Busters site is to release cheat fixes much more quickly than Valve is able/willing to.
