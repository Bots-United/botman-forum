I decided to make this an extra thread since it seems to be a different affair than the "ghosts":
Another bug that I noticed on the DS when enabling logging: the game seemed to miss that some bots re-connected after leaving the server first. I logged the ClientConnect() function in my code and it obviously got executed for every joining bot, but the server somehow doesn't realize it in all cases... Again, no idea where to look for the bug. 
The real problem is that my bot is not running stable on dedicated servers with heavy traffic, after some hours it freezes with full RAM and CPU usage. I'm checking for memory leaks in my own code right now but haven't found anything yet. The fakeclient patch by Leon Hartwig doesn't seem to apply for my bot since I don't use a bot class that extends the BasePlayer class. Rather I have a pointer to the Bot class in the bot_t structure (which is properly freed when bots are disconnecting). Any ideas of what might be the problem? Unfortunately I can't reproduce the freeze on my machine, since my internet connection is not fast enough to set up a DS and the problem only seems to arise on internet servers...

If it's Internet only it *might* have something to do with Bots not being netclients but then we couldn't do anything about it. I don't have a clue yet, sorry.

I have experienced the same problem with my bots (with different expressions though). Maybe you will be interested in looking at the thread I just posted, Tobias ("I fixed the ghost bots bug, but..."). I think the engine doesn't even destroy nor reset its client entities when a client is disconnecting and just leaves it "as is", and is just reusing it as soon as a new client joins. This is definitely a lack of cleanliness from Valve developers IMHO, and is the cause of my problems (but maybe for yours too). I don't have a clue on how to fix it cleanly yet, I'm just asking for ideas.
