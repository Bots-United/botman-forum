Well my bot is very dumb at the momenet all they do is crowbaring everything. They never attack with weapons. They have to wait til they are looking at you dead in the face then they attack!

How can this be fixed?

they fire all the guns with me apart from 2 firing bugs ive noticed which im sure botman knows about first is the soldier rocket launcher he always seems incapable of firing more than 1 rocket and sometime the hw guy warms his gun up but doesnt actually fire.

Good work botman keep  it up

...And the sniper doesn't know he needs to stop running before trying to fire the sniper rifle.

Hopefully these will get fixed soon.  :)
