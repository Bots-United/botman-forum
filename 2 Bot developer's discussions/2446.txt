I just want to thank Botman for his  GREATTTTTT new toy....

They really rule and this is just 0.1 ....................... I have just tested it on Half-Life maps yet but it rules....... Now the less famos mods can get some waypoints they aren't maybe as great as the pro waypoints but they still RULES... thanks BOTMAN...

yeah and a question i tested the bot at xfire2 the problem is that it is a wall (dont know what it is on English) that the bots try to shot true with the pistol they can't so they fire fire fire and fire to they get out of ammo...

I dunno what you mean here, do u mean your bot shoots at walls for no reason? Make sure that youre bots arent trying to shoot breakables etc beacause their origin is 0,0,0

He probably means there is a func_wall entity (like a fence or rail or something else blocking movement and gunshots) and the bots can't "see" it because the tracelines don't hit brush model entities.

There's not much that can be done about this in the game since I still don't know of a method to get the Half-Life engine to have tracelines hit brush model entities (other than loading up the BSP data yourself and going through all the traceline crap yourself, YUK!).

use TraceHull.. that's not a line, but it shouldn't be too difficult to adjust algos to it. If you use it with anything != point_hull it is blocked by func_walls and other things.

Found something that should be done..

in your traceline_draw() function it might be an idea to add to the start glDepthFunc(GL_ALWAYS); and to the end glDepthFunc(GL_LESS); that way it should draw the trace line thru anything, glass, etc

"add to the start glDepthFunc(GL_ALWAYS)..."

I had it that way to start with, but it was too difficult to tell where the point was if it hit a thin wall and you went to the other side of the wall.  I figured it was easier to "find" it if it only showed up when it should be visible (i.e. in the view frustum).
