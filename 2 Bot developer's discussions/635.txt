Hey, I was thinking of an idea for waypoint path code... What if we stored the angles the player was looking in when the waypoint was placed?

If this is done in an "Autowaypoint" fassion, then we should end up looking at the next waypoint if they are placed correctly.

It would also help for ladder climbing.

But, how will this affect memory in terms of Kb?

Will something like 2Kb seriously affect the engine? (Even though I do not think a waypoint file gets this big if formatted correctly)

thats not necessary redeemer...I believe I have found a way to use pathwaypoint create1 and create2 points to navigate the ladders at about 90% sucess rate(I have seen humans navigate worse)...

My test waypoint files get about 60kB big (and they ARE formatted correctly): there are a lot of things useful to store for your waypoints and you shouldn't worry about memory consumption on this topic...
