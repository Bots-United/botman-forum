First of all it have no sens. You shouldn't give people so crappy (sorry if it's all what you can make) code. You give people code with many bugs and makes that they will spend many hours before they understand it and fix it.

On the other hand it is good that you want help other. But you should just explain them how some things work.

Maybe at the begining you should relase stripped code (LOL - I don't know if botman have some any objections) which will be stripped from all func like aiming, navigating, finding waypoints etc. It should be also compatible with CS 1.0 so there should be links to new weapoins and #defines for them (i dont remeber but in weapons.h int 11 12 and 13 are in CS 1.0 for new weapons). Then you can publish your func.

And at the end... First 5 topis is yours and I feel like you have just spawned this forum (or take overcontrol LOL). Make it on your site. And send the message (reply) to your one topic (like new tutorial).

I hope you aren't angry on me.

I agree with Aleksander partly: you should not just post plain code, but explain HOW the 'beginners' could implement it so they will understand and learn from it. You also force them to implement it 'your way', which is, in my opinion, not the best way at all.
It's very kind though that you're willing to share you're code (not that I need it btw :))

I think it's ok, what DY does, except flooding this forum. The first you've to learn as a beginner is to read the data, got from debug_engine. All other things like adding elements to existing structures should be easy, if you read a bit of the strucures of the HL-SDK or the HPB - template source (If you can write c/c++ code).
And if you write a little function logging all entities with some of their variables, you'll get a lot of information.
I think DY's code fragments are just a kind of inspiration, and you should be able to write that on your own, if your bot should be better than the compiled HPB-template code does.

That's my opinion too. Code as inspiration...like: "That's the way u do it" ;-)
I think all of the people in this forum are able to code the things they wnat to have,but maybe some could use some pseudo code.Just for giving a direction,an inspiration, i mean. Code with declared data members etc. is too narrow for giving directions. It says: Do this and modify it.

All of the code I gave out worked except one problem with the buying. I forgot to mention one bot_t variable and yabb didnt like some of the double = signs and they appear as one at places.

The bomb planting had a bug in it which was intentional I have a lot of anti-radio spamming code in there which had to be stripped out to make it understandable.

Every code example has been greeted warmly and only a couple of complaints...

IF YOU DONT LIKE MY CODE DONT USE IT.

Im currently cleaning up my code and then im doing a source code release which Im sure will not be taken well by some.
