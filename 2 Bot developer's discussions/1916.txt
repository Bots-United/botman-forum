OK, im trying to write a weapon-banning addon for firearms, and im using your stripper addon as a base(i will give you credit ofcourse).  I changed the library to load, and I changed all the LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC calls to be correct for firearms.  Basically, what I have right now is a do-nothing hook.  I tried to test it, and after I selected a config from the menu, the game just exited.  No error, nothing, just whole thing exited.  I was just wondering if anyone has ever had this problem / how they fixed it?

Try running it in the Microsoft Visual Debugger to see where things are going wrong.

P.S. Bill, can you fix some of the weird bugs in Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer for me?  Thanks!  ;D

You could download the botmans exports program Ive compiled for u :-) I've also made it print out LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(..); so all u have to do is direct it to a file and copy/paste...

eg. run it like : exports.exe mp.dll >C:\func.txt

To get your code build in MSVC in debug mode, look into the extdll.h file. If you see something like

code:

// Allow "DEBUG" in addition to default "_DEBUG"
#ifdef _DEBUG
  #define DEBUG 1
#endif



If you are not using the DBG_EntOfVars and DBG_AssertFunction routines mentioned in the SDK util.h, comment out the #define DEBUG 1 line. Then you should be able to compile with debugging switched on.
