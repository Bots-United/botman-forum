Can anybody tell me what is going on? I know that there is a button behind that "func_wall" entity, but can any of you tell me what is does? :D Or has Mr. Dario Casali added a myterious button in that kick ass level?

The winner who can tell me what the button does gets a carrot :D 

Has anybody else suffered with this?? :D

maybe you draw a beam to the bmodel origin of the button, then you know where it is :)

about what it does : every button has a target, so there is a FindEntity function with which you can see what entity is targeted by this button.

...or you can use the BSP tools to dump the map file entities.

But, not every button has a target.  Some buttons get added during the development of a map and then things get removed during playtesting.  Sometime buttons and triggers aren't removed before the map is released.

yeah, ok not every button ... but in that case you just get a zero pointer and that's not problematic :)

:) The grill covering up the flames (on doublecros) actually turns out to be a button, I thought it was a func_wall entity, as all entities (door, wall ect) allow you to change the rendering mode (Been awhile since I last created a map, so can't tell you exactly what it's name is in worldcraft/hammer) so that parts of textures don't show up, like a blue area on a ladder texture.

Because of this I was lead to believe that the grill (shown in the screenshot that I've posted a link to) was a func_wall entity. It's actually a func_button entity, that needs to be shot (Like in DMC)

I've added a check to see if the buttons pev->takedamage flag is DAMAGE_YES If this is the case you need to shoot the button.

So, Now I know (But didn't when I made the post) that the grill is a button and my bot was stuck using it :S Now it hits it.

(the grill is actually part of a secret area on doublecross)

I thought this info might be useful for anybody making a DMC bot, There arn't many mods where  you have to shoot a button anymore :|
