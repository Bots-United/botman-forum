I'm having trouble *just* as the map is one step away from loading, it says something about "info_firearms_detect not detected" when i have LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(info_firearms_detect); in my linkfunc.cpp

Hi,

Just put this  line in linkfunc.cpp
...
LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(info_firearms_detect);
...

And make sure u link all other entities
in there as well.

I think Noodles was saying that he already had LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC(info_firearms_detect) in the linkfunc.cpp file.

Just MAKE SURE that it's spelled correctly in the linkfunc.cpp file.

if you are using Ming

delete "HPB_bot_ming.def"
then compile agian

Half-Life is still quitting, just after the sky renderings are loaded up, info_firearms_detect is still coming up after deleting the ming def.

----
"info_firearms_detect entity not found"
