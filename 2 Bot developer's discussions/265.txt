Does anybody know how to make ALL the bots run at the correct speed with the Bot10src? (if you have this bot proggy have a look to see if you can see this problem) I'm going mad over this one, I am new to C++ but the class stuff seems fine to me (each bot aims in different places.. maybe thats to do with CBasePlayer?) I know the variable "f_move_speed" is a new one to the game, so I was wondering, do the bots have the same trouble with other new varibles? (Such as users, and lifts, hev recharger use time and so on). I would like to use the HPB BOT, but I am in the process of making a complete mod ("Hostile Takeover" which is based at: www.geocities.com/mattkimbo/) so I want just one mp.dll file. I know the bots (Well one of them :) ) runs at the correct speed, based on the msecval, "gpGlobals->frametime * 1000" but why just one bot!!???
