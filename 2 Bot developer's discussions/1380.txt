Well I'm making a bot for the mod Runaway Train now. And I want them to capture trains, but how can I determine the origin of the train? The train is a FUNC_TRACKTRAIN (I know that because I decompiled the bsp for that :)

I used VecBmodelOrigin();
But it didn't work I think or it is something else.

Anyone any ideas??

This code from plats.cpp (in CFuncTrackTrain::Next) leads me to believe that the pev->origin (or pEdict->v.origin) should be the current origin of the train platform...
code:
      Vector nextPos = pev->origin;

      nextPos.z -= m_height;
      CPathTrack *pnext = m_ppath->LookAhead( &nextPos, pev->speed * 0.1, 1 );
      nextPos.z += m_height;

      pev->velocity = (nextPos - pev->origin) * 10;
      Vector nextFront = pev->origin;

To Cheesemonster:
You have to download it its very cool. How longer you stay on the train, the more points you get. And you can set all sorts of traps for the player who's on the train :). The site is: www.planethalf-life.com/rat
It is not much to download :)
It's really fun over LAN :D

To Botman:
I'll look at that right away, but can I determine the origin or can't I? And is it possible to get the bots to run towards a train another way???
I'll post some code to make my point some clearer.

F*ck My English is worse :(

Bye

Hey,

I just got an idea.
I can look for the path-entities if the train is moving and let the bots pause there and then climb on the train, maybe I'll try that :)

Good luck getting them to jump onto a moving object.  I can barely get them to jump onto a stationary box!  :D

:)

Well I got them to walk towards the path-entity (not very hard) and they spot the train if it comes running towards them.
Now to get them to jump in time ;).
Should take a lot of time :(
