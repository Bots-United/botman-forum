Didnt know under which heading to put this. but i noticed that the waypoints provided with your latest copy, the file extension is ex: 2fort.HPB_wpt and 3rd party extension or just plain 2fort.wpt. I was wondering must i rename the 3rd party waypoints to HPB_wpt? or does the prog read both files? Thank you for listening to me yap my mouth.
