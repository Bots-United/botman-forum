To aim to the head, the target should be

Vector vTarget = pTarget->v.origin + pTarget->v.view_ofs;

and not just pTarget->v.origin

Oh yea thats a good one, a russian boy who codes for half life and is 14 years old. Give me a fewkin break. 1st of all, russians dont have a good pc for hl, 2nd they dont have engine c++ russian language. Third, this non-russian person is trying to create a hack. Like anyone wants to. So basically answering hes question was dumb.

That was my side who doesnt like hackers, and is paranoid at everything. Now my good side's turn: Well, I just wanted to ask why would you wanna have a bot who aims the head ? So that he would own you / other bots / other online players when you spawn him in your server ???

Getting bots to shoot at the head is a good thing.

Anybody who plays against bots SHOULD want them to shoot at the head every once in a while.  If you don't want them to shoot at other player's heads, you should prevent human players from shooting at people's heads as well just to keep things fair.  Bots are people too!

bruk ma, I don't see your point.
Isn't the purpose of a bot to simulate the human players' behaviour ?
OR are you trying to say that every russian that is 14 years old can only be interested in developing hacks ?
Let's not make unallegated accusations about anyone just like that. After all, the HPB_bot is a venerable server-side bot. Nothing more...

There is thread in here about finding the origin of "bones". In that thread I posted a modified version of the bot aiming routince that will aim exactly at the origin of whatever bone you specified. 

Do a search for "bones" to find the original thread with the new routine it.

Passing the bone index of the head to this routine will force the bot to aim exactly at the head, or whatever other body part you want. 

My tests demonstrated that this aiming function is a huge improvement over the original random "offset" approach. You can easily make it less accurate to simulate weaker human players. 

The latest (mEAn) Bot.Admin mod now uses the improved aiming routine. You can check it out for yourself from here http:://www3.telus.net/mean
