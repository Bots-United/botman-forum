I'm trying to understand how bots work in conjunction with a third party mod (i.e. Counterstrike).  What would really help me is the source for a dll between halflife and the mod without anything related to a bot in it anywhere.  Is this as simple as replacing every function with one or two exceptions in dll.cpp with

void myFunction( edict_t *pEntity )
{
   (*other_gFunctionTable.myFunction)(pEntity);
}

or am I missing something?  If so, which functions should not be tampered with?

Thanks for any help in advance.

take a look into h_export.cpp, I guess that'll help a lot :)

You could take a look at metamod (www.metamod.org) since this is basically a "shell" that hooks between the Half-Life engine and a large number of MODs.

Metamod allows other plugins to be loaded and it will "merge" them all between the Half-Life engine and the MOD game DLL code.

I've pretty much gotten a good feel for it.  I wanted a shell based on the bots that I could compare to the actual bots so I understood exactly how they hooked in, but I traced a lot of the code and have a good idea what is going on.

Thanks for the advice though
