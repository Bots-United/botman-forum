If I wanted to simulate that something happened in game when it really didn't how could I accomplish that. For example, I'd like to be able to apply the effect of the concussion grenade from TFC to a player on command. I know how to interpret console input from the client, but after I receive the command how might I apply the conuss'ed effect to the player entity?

You could spawn an entity right next to the player (if that does what you want).

For client side effects, you could send the network message to a player that handles the effects you want.  Turn on the engine logging stuff in metamod or my HPB bot code to see which network messages get sent to players when certain events happen (like grenades exploding, etc.).  Note that this will NOT damage a player or effect any items that they are carrying/using/etc. it will just be the visual and audio effects and nothing more.

yeah all i want is hte visual "dizzyness" created by the concussion grenade which I am going to use with an admin "slap" command. I dont use metamod. How do I turn on the engine logging in hpb_bot?
