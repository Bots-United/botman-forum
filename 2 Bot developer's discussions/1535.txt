I had the same problem when I added it to sven-coop. We must both be making the same mistake. take a look at my thread at:

SZ_GETSPACE allocation errors are another way of saying you're out of memory.

When you're doing add-ons to any game or anything (AND REGULAR GAMEPLAY IS ENHANCED TOO!), you should add these strings to the path you connect to half-life
-heapsize x
where x is equal to about 60% to 85% of your total system RAM in Kb (where 1000Kb = 1MB of RAM).  So, for example, I had 256MB of ram and have found that 81% works best for my system when I am doing work like tihs so it looks like this:
-heapsize 210000
(0.81 * 256) * 1000 = 210000
That will allocate that many Kb of memory STRICTLY for Half-Life and no other program.  additionally, you may have to lower or raise this setting depending on how many programs you use in the background and other things like that.

-zone 4096
this allocates more memory from your heap to loading files such as configs and what not.  I've found it's basically a catch-all fix just about anything type of command line.  It works really great with the heapsize command above!

Also, these commands will boost general gaming performance by allocating more memory to specific areas so that the half-life engine doesn't have to mess with it.

That does not help at all :(
I am sure crono will have the same results.
I think we did the same thing in the code.

I found the function which crash HL :

g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove( pEdict, pEdict->v.v_angle, 0.0,0, 0, pEdict->v.button, 0, pBot->msecval);

You can try to comment it camus but you'll see that the bot won't move, is invisible,... bugged at all...

I don't know what to do :(

I've also gotten the "SZ_GETSPACE: tried to write to an uninitialized sizebuff_t" error when pointers were screwed up.

Try going back to the original HPB bot template source code and modify things JUST A FEW LINES AT A TIME.  Don't cut-and-paste a whole bunch of stuff at once.  Add ONE SMALL function, rebuild, test it out.  Add ONE more SMALL function, rebuild, test it out.  Etc., etc., etc.

It's kind of slow going, but it may be the only way to determine what you changed that's causing it to crash.

I prefered to adapt the bot in the server code but I still have a problem :(
How can I make the bot choose a team and a class ?

Please help me

Hmm. This crashing bug is only a problem for certain mods. I tried the same dll on a different mod(ffl) and it was fine. The differences are that all the bot config files etc. are not in sven-coops folder and sven-coop has different dlls, wads, and models. Hmm. It could be the models.

BTW, I only changed what I stated in the other thread and I added some things to linkfunc.

SZ_GetSpace has to do with allocating memory from the process itself. If you use a MOD that doesn't properly allocate or deallocate memory, then you will recieve this message.

Hmm. So I guess the HPB_BOT is somehow causing this bug to appear. I wonder if any shorcuts/cheats/bad structure were used in creating the code :(

I'm having this problem too...
Are there any fixes yet?
