Ok....A little off topic....But I've been unable to find this info anyhere.....just clue me in if you can. I have an idea of just making a simple menu system for Counter-strike which I could just hit one simple bound key i.e. F1 and it opens my very own menu system i.e. the BUY menu......with several options etc.....can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks so much in advance......and e-mail or replies are welcome...

If you are talking about creating your own VGUI menu then you probably can't do this (since it would require replacing the client.dll with your own version and then you wouldn't be able to connect to an Internet server).  If you are talking about creating one of the old style text menus, you could do that, but the modified code would have to be running on the server (not the client).  Is that what you want (i.e. running your own server)?

What I wanted to do is to make a buy-script sorta but instead of hitting lets say F1 to buy my MP5 I wanted to hit F1 and a small text only menu came up with all my favorite buy items and/or radio commands. I would think this could be run on the client side only since it would only make a new menu right? Thank you for all your help botman....

It would be easier to write up a shopping script than getting all the trouble of cracking HL's DLLs (which will obviously take a long, long time)... :D

I've see scripts like this done before.  The "menu" is actually just echo commands with the text.  Then the script assigns F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5 to other aliases to buy items.  It's all done with scripting, no code is required.
