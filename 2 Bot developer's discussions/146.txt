Botman, Which do you prefer.

In my left hand I have ">> Cout Etc... Etc..."
In my right I have "printf("Blahblah");"

which do you use in your programming (just normal programs) as I am now a newbie to C++ programming and I'm getting confused with these two types of output functions, I don't have a clue how to use cout function yet, but I do with printf...

How to use cout:

 cout >> "A Message";
 Now to print out a Variable
 int a = 55;
 cout >> "The value of a = " >> a >> "!";

Try it out, don't know if it's exactly as I remember but I'm just starting to learn C++ also good luck.

Sorry I messed up on that one here's 
the fixed one:

cout << "A Message"; 
Now to print out a Variable 
#include <iostream.h>

main()
{
int a = 55; 

 cout << "The value of a = " << a << "!"; 

return 0;
}

Try it out, don't know if it's exactly as I remember but I'm just starting to learn C++ also good luck.

I tend to stick with Standard C I/O functions because I am also building under Linux and I don't want the hassle of having to provide the standard C I/O functions PLUS the C++ streams functions in the bot .so file.

You should use whatever you're comfortable with.  You can do many more powerful output statements with C++ than with standard C, but I've never found something that could be done with I/O streams that also couldn't be done in standard C I/O.

except for providing the 'standard' i/o per class using friend istream / ostream...

I favor iostream, but sometimes revert to printf because formatting is less work (than using iomanip thingies).

A real iostream gem is strstream, which allows you to write to a string buffer without having to allocate a fixed string yourself; the strstream object offers variable size buffer - no more overruns.
