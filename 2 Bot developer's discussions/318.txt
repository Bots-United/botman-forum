I made "cheesy's waypoint guide" (how to make some good waypoints) on my waypoint site at

http://www.waypointwarehouse.8k.com 

If u'd like to make some waypoints after that inspiration then submit them to me on the site!

:D

Hey housemuzic, you're REALLY starting to tick me off.  Tone it down a little or you will get IP banned.  If you don't have something nice to say...

Yeh it IS a little advertsing :) I've put a "getting started" part in it by going through lots of steps. And of course the common pitfalls which can make the waypoints look nasty and ugly....;)

You know you have done something bad when you've pissed off botman, he usually has lots of patience. ;) Watch it housemuzic, he means business!
