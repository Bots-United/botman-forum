Hi, thanks for the e-mail. Now I know how to compile the dll file but I'm a long way to devp a bot.

Anyway I just want to ask. What is edict_t in the
source code?? What type is it and where can I find it in the source code.

Can you give me some tips on how to look through your source code, like what to find and what are the key classes that you must know??

thanks a million.

edict_t is the structure the engine uses for entities.  Search the engine and common directories for things that you can't find in the dlls directory.
