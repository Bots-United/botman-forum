Hi...

Ok I would just like to know where is the code that start the game and initialize everything when a new game/map is loaded.

Is it GameDLLInit() or StartFrame()?

This is because I want to initialize something during that period. I dont really know where to find the part.

And one more thing is, where is the point that the waypoints have been loaded to the map?
I saw sth about DispatchSpawn but weren't so sure about it.

Plz Help..

I think it's better if u look from where waypointload is called .... and that is I think from dispatchspawn ...

When talking about Counter-Strike, you should check it in the dll.cpp at:

edict_t* pfnFindEntityByString(edict_t *pEdictStartSearchAfter, const char *pszField, const char *pszValue)
{
//   if (debug_engine) { fp=fopen("bot.txt","a"); fprintf(fp,"pfnFindEntityByString: %s\n",pszValue); fclose(fp); }
         if (strcmp(pszValue,"info_map_parameters") == 0) 
{
// New round
}

}

you could set a new round flag when the info_map_parameters is called.

For an entire new map/game, you should check at DispatchSpawn as @$3.1415rin suggested.
