mmmm.... i don't think botman is supposed to be back yet, but he answered some questions... well cool
1. In some maps for frontline, when the bots are outside, like on the ship deck in flf_fox the traceline function seems to go all weird.  As far as i can tell, it doesn't return a value, since although there appears to be nothing blocking them the values of the tr.tracefraction are less than one (at least it seems that way)  is there some way i can tell when the trace is going out to the map edge instead of hitting a wall or a box?
and secondly
2. If i want a function to be called at the beginning of every new map, will it work to put the call in StartFrame() inside of the if loop labled:
      // if a new map has started then...
      if (previous_time > gpGlobals->time)
{
//my code here
//other template code here 
}
will this be called even the first time a map is started, or only when a new (ie second) map is started?
note, i'm using template 1

thanks,

Dan

1. I beleive that TraceLines that extend beyond the end of the world return a flFraction of 1.0 (indicating that they didn't hit anything).

2. You can put code in one of two places.  The DispatchSpawn() function will be called with a "worldspawn" class at the start of each map.  But none of the other entities (including players) will exist at this point.  If you simply want to initialize some global variables that players would eventually use, you can put them in the DispatchSpawn() function (at the point where I initialze and load waypoints and precache the waypoint sounds).  The other place is, like you said, in the StartFrame() function where I check if a new map has been loaded.  All of the world entities should be created by this point (but not necessarily players).

I have just one more question:
could someone tell me where on a door the vector value is?  ie: is it on the ground, in the middle of the door, on the hing or what?  
And what are the differences between the three door types?  i know the standard func_door, but for instance what kind of a door is on the personel carries used in FLF_village?  and could you give some examples of a momentary_door and a func_door_rotating?  what about the sliding doors that open automatically?  are they a different entity?
(as you can see, i'm working on doors :) )
thanks

Hi,

The origin of a door is (0,0,0) you have to use VecBModelOrigin(edict_t *) . That puts the origin smack in the middle of the door.

You could use botman's "find" command for the apc, but they look like func_door_rotating to me.

sliding doors a func_door

momentary_door is not very often used in multiplayer. Remember in Half-Life when you're in the dam, you have to turn the wheel and keep it held down until the grates open, then make a run(swim :) ) for it while they're closing? Those grates are momentary doors.
