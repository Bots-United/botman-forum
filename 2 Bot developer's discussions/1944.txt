Mostly, the servers one want to play is full and you'll have to type retry until you are accepted.

Would it be possible to make a bot, which automaticaly would type retry until your connection is accepted?

I realise, it would require a check on the messages which is sent and displayed to the console.

It would be simpler to make a little application that checks the number of current players on a specific server.  You can obtain this information using the published network protocol in the Half-Life Standard SDK.  See my NetProbe web page for the source code to a C program that will connect to a specific server and download the server specific information (current map, max players, current number of players, etc.)...

...once you know a slot is available, you could spawn a command line shell that would exec hl.exe with the necessary command line arguments to connect to that server.

Just to nice to the server admin, you probably don't want to ping the server any more often than once every 10 or 15 seconds.

GameSpy has a "busy server redial" feature which does this (at least in the registered version).

Yes it has, but it does not work correctly always. Besides, for my use, it unuseable because
it needs to start halflife when a slot is free. Starting halflife before trying to join is too slow - the free slot would be occupied by the time its ready.

Halflife needs to be started beforehand. Then it somehow needs to tell halflife to try joining the server.

The biggest problem for me is to find out whether the connection has been accepted or not. I can't get the text from the console and I just wondered, if that problem could be solved by making a clientside (or a serverside) bot which would pass out the text to a textfile or as a Windows message.
