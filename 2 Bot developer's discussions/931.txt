Merry X-Mas everyone :)

I use the WaypointDrawBeam function very often and sometimes the beams I drew disappear and reappear radomly, mostly, when many beams are in the same area.
Is that a error in my code/graphic card/HL or a non-resolveable problem?

I had that problem too. You can solve it by only drawing the waypoints within the FOV.
