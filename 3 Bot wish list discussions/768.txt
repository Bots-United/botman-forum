Maybe a chat room isnt necessary(hint!) The forum is good enough for now...just as long as you post arent removed(hint)

botman isn't the one who made the chat room in the first place, it was matt, and as long as matt keeps it up is as long as we are going to have it. i think its a nice feature if someone would actually go there.

P.S. ryan, its supposed to be "can't you get that through you think SKULL"
