Could you give each bot a quote and they would say it sometimes when the bot kills someone?
It could go in the bot.cfg along with the bot! (or something)

For example, if i add my friend "duckdoo" as a bot, he would say "KISS ME FAT BOY!!!" after he killed someone... :)

Actually in the next release I plan on having a "bot_whine.txt" file where the bots will say things when they get killed (just like on a real Internet server).  You can put in your own text and anywhere a %n appears it will get replaced with the other player's name.  Examples would be...

"Hey %n, why do you keep killing me???"
"CAMPER ALERT!  CAMPER ALERT!  %n is a CAMPER!!!"
"%n, I let you kill me because I wanted to rest my mouse hand"
"What the... %n is using a HEAD SHOT SCRIPT!!!"
