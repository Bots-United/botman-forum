Sorry, that would kinda suck. Then it wouldnt be realistic. Usaully when you ask someone on a server if they would followe you or attack someone, you usauuly get answers ranging from "My cats name is Muffy" to "Go f*** yourself you friggin twat! Take your head outta your ass! Im gonna kill you in front of your whole family you f***ing twat mommas boy, rat a** piece of s**t!!!!" :)
