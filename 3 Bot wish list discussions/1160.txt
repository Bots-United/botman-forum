i THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER ONE OF THESE FOLLOWING THINGS:

*Spies disguise and feign
*A more advanced waypoint sistem
*you can tell the bots to atack or to defend by putting a comand in the console
*THE BOTS PLAY GOOD "THE HUNTED"
I THINK A LOT OF LIKE ENJOY PLAYING THE HUNTED(LIKE ME) ILL BE VERY HAPPY IF YOU CAN DO THE BOTS KNOW THE RULES OF THE GAME

i ALSO NOTICED A VERY GOOD ONE BOT   THE FOX BOT YOU CAN LOOK THIS  PAGE BY LOOKING IN THE LINK 
BUTON

HE CAN BUILD SENTRY  !! SPIES DISGUISE AND THEY EVEN KILL YOU IN THE BACK WITH THEIR KNIFES!!!
THIS BOTS ARE VERY INTELLIGENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE SCOUTS TRY RUN FOR THE FLAG INSTEAD OF FIGHT

FOR MY OPINION ITS BETTER THAN THE HPB BOT

Huh, no consolecommand please, a menu or a chat message would be a lot better and easier to handle

yes you are rigth my English is terrible butt at least i can understand it. but im not norwaian(wathever)


about the console comand i think its better because in a map like " 2fort" you can put atack underwater or in the bridge  or protect the flag

foxbot does have these features but i think botman actually trys hard to make the bot more realistic and other features which we would never think of because we dont code the bot and see what its not doing.  For some reason ive always prefered this bot, even though other bots have more advanced features. Guess I can just feel that theres been alot more hard work gone into this bot to get it as real as it can get.

Botmans intention was to let other coders make a new bot with different features.  If he didnt want this he would never have released the source code would he?
