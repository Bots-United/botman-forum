HPB may not support it, But AgroBot does, -- agrobot.aus3d.net/AgroBot
I don't know how well it plays since i don't have Science & Industry..

The hpb_bot cant be compatible with everything, you should look for bots that are specific for a particular modifation instead of a bot that can just play some mods partialy and one mod completely :)

When you like normal HL teamplay then you`ll love it but you`ll even like it if you`re TFC-Fan. But the Agrobot isn`t working in S&I, he joins the game but he don`t move ???

Hi,

The ODD_Bot does not currently support SI. It crashes after you kill one of the little suckers:(. But other than that it is fine. I am currently working with Papasnewbag to fix the problem.

Thanks,
