Can you make waypoints for the sniper bots so that they move with the rest and increase the bot veiw for the sniper since he is a long range fighter. In anrodiot bot the zones that he uses the bot don't come off of them and if a  player or bot are on the other side it will starf or something.

Bots using sniper weapons don't really need to change the field of view (FOV).  They can "see" all the way across the map just as easy as they can "see" 10 feet away.  The accuracy of the weapon is the only thing limiting them from killing someone at 10,000 paces.

In the next release (due out in a couple of weeks) there will be waypoints marked as "sniper spots" where snipers can go to and "hang out" for a while waiting for any unsuspecting target to come along.

I probably ought to work on fixing the bot's sniper weapon ability a little bit too since they don't seem to use the TFC sniper rifle very well at the moment.

The bots use the crowbar because the crowbar does a LOT of damage when the bot is close up (and it doesn't use up any ammo).

Yes, it already does that.  Look in the bot.cfg file to see about the botskill level.  The default skill level is 2 (set using "botskill 2").  You can change this or specify the skill level when creating the bots like so...

"Can you train the bots to do tricks like rocket jumbing?"

I tried training them before, but now I've run out of "bot treats" to train them with.  :)

Additional features will be added to the bot over time, gauss jumping (in HL and OpFor) and conc jumping (in TFC) may be added later on.  Right now I'm just trying to work on getting them to navigate the levels well enough to be able to get to a goal as quickly as possible.

To make them rocket jump, just make them face the ground, run a bit, and fire the rocket launcher :-)

By the way, i've heard there is bots in the original quake team fortress (there even in the source code)

The only prob is that i dont know how to add them.
Are they only available in a special version?

When making waypoints how dou put a waaaypoint to allow a bot to go up a ladder?

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
The HPB bot Alpha 3 release currently doesn't support waypoints on ladders.  I am adding that as part of the next release, but haven't decided how much of the source code will be released.

Note that when you are on a ladder, the player's movetype gets changed to MOVETYPE_FLY by the Half-Life engine (as soon as you touch the ladder).  If the bot notices that it's movetype is MOVETYPE_FLY then it should assume that it's on a ladder (since you can't really do a traceline to figure out whether there's a ladder in front of the bot or not).

That's my plan.  There will be a "bot_whine.txt" file where you can put phrases that the bots will say.

Hey,

 How hard is it to put in camping and sniping points, and 'Grenade' points (where a bot is most likely to throw a concussion grenade).

 Also, do you have any plans to implement 'Flocking' in the bots? This would work well in CS, but TFC would ultimatly be a harder bot to create.

Btw, its good too see you pay attention to your forums

My next release of the HPB bot will have "sniper waypoints".  These will be waypoints with a tag marking them as a good sniper spot.  Bots with sniper weapons will search the list of waypoints for sniper waypoints and head toward them.  They'll hang out at those positions for 20-30 seconds hoping to get an easy kill.

To add tags to the waypoints just modify the waypoint.h file and include new flags (like W_FL_SNIPER, W_FL_SENTRYGUN, etc.) then add code to look for those types of waypoints and do whatever action is required at those points.

In the source code where can I find the bot "FOV"


--------------------------------------------------
09/27/00 at 05:09:33  Reply by: botman (botman@mailandnews.com)
--------------------------------------------------
The FOV for bots is the same as for players, 90 degrees.  I have a function in the bot.cpp file called, surprisingly, BotInFieldOfView() that returns the number of degrees between an entity and the direction the bot is looking.  So anything within 45 degrees (to the left or right) of where the bot is looking would be in it's field of view.

Nope.  The only changes are:

1) New waypoint format with path finding code.  Bots now know the quickest way to get from one point in the map to another point in the map (as long as waypoints exist).

2) Pause waypoints (for doors) and Sniper waypoints (just long pauses).

3) Marginally better ladder usage code.  The go up ladders okay, and try to go down ladders without falling (the just aren't very skilled at doing so).

4) They know how to navigate underwater now.

5) They know how to capture the flag/keycard (at the flag/keycard base or dropped on the ground) and return the flag/keycard to the capture point.

6) They know how grab the ball in PUSH and carry it to the goal.

7) I'll try to fix the sniper weapon firing problem (they don't know you can't run and fire the sniper rifle at the same time).

8) I may add phrases that get spoken when the bots get killed.  This will be a text file that users can cusomize.

9) I may add a "bot_names.txt" file that will allow you to create names for the bots.  They will choose from this list when spawned and won't duplicate names already in use.

Numbers 8 and 9 depend on whether I get everything else done before tommorow afternoon or not.  But there won't be any additional weapons supported, no tweaks to the weapon firing code (except possibly the sniper).  There won't be any special skills implemented (like sentry gun or dispenser or spy feigning).  Disquised spys still won't fool the bots (they're too smart for that!).

I did fix a few minor bugs that no one has complained about and one major bug (bots used to shoot at observer positions like the camera position in the map PUSH).

Yes, that will happen later.  I will expand the waypoint menu to provide other types of waypoints.  I also plan to convert the menu to VGUI format instead of the traditional text menu, but I had already got the text menu working and didn't have time to change it before the release.

No.  If you don't specify a team then all teams can/will use that waypoint.  The team specific tag is in there so you can create waypoints that only 1 team should be able to get to.  Like resupply areas or flag/capture points.

Currently the sniper waypoints are not sniper only waypoints.  I will probably change things in the next release so that there are tags for each class on the waypoints where ONLY that class will visit the waypoint (you can combine two tags together on the same waypoint if you wish).

I didn't get time to add in the bot_whine.txt file stuff.  With the waypoint "bug" that I had, it took me almost one whole day to figure out what was actually happening.  I managed to throw in the bot_names.txt file stuff the morning that I put up the release (it was almost completely untested).

I've got SOOOOO many ideas and so much stuff that I want to add in that I can't seem to find time to do it all.  But as long as I keep having fun doing this stuff you can be sure that I'll keep releasing new versions.  Keep the ideas and questions coming!  I've always tried to be open to suggestions and value any comments that anyone may have.

Keep up the good work man, they keep getting to be more and more fun. Here are some things that i wish for, some of them are obvious so forgive me.

1. Medics using medic kits
2. engies building sg's oh yeah and dispensers
3.farther line of site for snipers
4. have it so the bodyguards don't try to kill the hunted
5. teams 3 and 4
6. rocket jumping soldiers
7. somehow make it so some bots are basically defensive campers, like maybe have it be an extra option when making a bot 
8. grenades? is the reason why they don't use them because it would just be a spammy mess?
9. also if the bots would know to attack sg's
10. somehow if the spy thing could work
11. and if when the bots are poisoned they yelled "MEDIC!!" and "Excuse me, I'm in need of medical attention!"

Ok, now i digress, but in a perfect world all of this would be possible. Thanks for taking the time to listen to us Botman, keep up the good work.

I have *my bots throwing grenades everywhere.
It can be fun, although they have a tendancy
to blow themselves up. Programming the bots
to stay away from grenades is going to prove
to be a very difficult task.

It is also quite easy to get an engineer to
build a sentry gun. The hard part is getting
him to go back and upgrade it.

Either way, I'm sure you will see these features
and more in future versions of HPB bot, they are
not impossible.

Kye.

The sniper problem of not slowing down before attempting to use the sniper rifle will be fixed in a future release.

I will eventually have a bot_whine.txt file that contains phrases that the bots will say whenever they kill someone or get killed.  You will be able to customize the phrases to be whatever you want.
