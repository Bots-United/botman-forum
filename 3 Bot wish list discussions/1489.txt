On my wishlist this year, I would wish that someone would make a beta 5.2 bot!
I pray to the heavens and stars above, 
please santa bring me a beta 5.2 bot for me to love.

I think Pikachu was attempting to make a CS 5.2 bot, but I haven't heard anything about this in a while.  Maybe Pikachu gave up on it.
