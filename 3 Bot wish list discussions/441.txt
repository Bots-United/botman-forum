OpFor CTF support means that the HPB bot will support op4ctf_xxxxxx maps (i.e. the bot will understand how to play capture the flag in Opposing Force).

"the other thing i tried in the console didnt seem to work"

What "other thing"?

P.S. I think your SHIFT key and your punctuation keys (. and ') on your keyboard are not working.
