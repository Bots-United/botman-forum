You do realize that you don't have to have a bot written as a metamod plugin to get it to work with AdminMOD and metamod, right?

See the AdminMOD documentation on how to run bots with AdminMOD (and metamod).  The only thing you need is a Linux port of the bot.

Look at the documentation on AdminMOD on the AdminMOD website (it is also a metamod plugin).  It explains how to use bots with AdminMOD/metamod (you don't NEED AdminMOD for this to work, it's just that the AdminMOD site has the documentation on how to do it).

If your running linux then you want to get the bot code from this site:

http://planethalflife.com/botman/downloads.shtml

Then you want to check out halfd

http://www.halfd.org  //very cool must check out

Further that, and as botman points out, there is more information about making the HPB_Bot work under linux *WITH* adminmod/metamod at the adminmod website, http://www.adminmod.org/

HTH
