In case anyone is still looking for a bot for Gunman Chronicles, one was made.. Here's the link - dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=4428Gunman Bot

And here's 4 waypoints for it - home.earthlink.net/~halflife12/Gunman_Waypoints/Gunman_wpt.zipGunman_wpt.zip

The bot dosen't know the wall health dispenser's & i don't think it use's the grenades. And it dosen't change the weapon mode. (By weapon mode, i mean "pulse/err whatever the other modes are for the guns". It does use all the weapons!)
Other than that it's actully fun. Since the author say's he's not really a coder, seems he got it working good enough to have fun.. :)

They do spray paint! You just have to download botmans V3.0 of the HPB & extract it to your Gunman folder, than just run the "bot_logo.exe"..
They do everything the HPB_bot 3.0 does.
