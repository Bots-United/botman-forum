Yes, the HPB bot supports Counter-Strike, but they bots don't buy weapons.  I only implemented Counter-Strike support in the HPB bot to show that it could be done over a year ago.  There are many other bots that are MUCH better at CS than the HPB bot is.  See my "Links" page for URLs to these web sites...
