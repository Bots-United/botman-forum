Click the <font color="Red">HPB Bot Menu Preview</font> Link to get the waypoints & map & see ingame screenies.. It's 4 Team play and is fully supported.. Plays nice! The Teams must get their flag to the Church & try and keep it there for as long as they can.. I've seen All 4 Teams do it!!

The Link,
grubber.hypermart.net/Grubber's GCM

cheesemonster, botman, if you want you can take any part and link or upload it to the warehouse\botman's bots.. Only if you feel that it's any good..? Or worth it. :-)
I just kinda started a site so that i could just upload my stuff as soon as i finished.. Plus sometimes i forget to burn my own stuff, so haveing a site helps in case i delete my Half-Life i can always retrive it.. hehe..
