Hey, how about a meta-mod plugin to grab, hold, copy, move, delete, etc.. entities?

DrunkenFool did it for AdminOp ( http://www.adminop.net/ )

I just think it would be rather fun to put a bunch of entities all over a map and make things from them :D

eh... why not just use admin op then?!!! Or get them to make it for metamod since they've already done it!?
