My wish is that the next thing you update on the bots botman is that weapaon.cfg thing you talked about in another thread, and that you get the medics to use their medkits and try to get the engies to built sg's and bots to know how to destroy them (u must be sick of hearing that).
Oh yeah, and could you also work on the bots using their grenades and the bots not recognizing u when u r disguised?
Damn, that was a huge wish list!

In my bot which is actually not release even though I posted I did :)_  

 The medics can heal you when you're hurt and also can use it against the enemy team. :)_

It's really funny seeing a medic infecting the other team!

hey brian L how comes you dont have a website about your little bot?
Oh and in your readme file it says to extract to c:\sierra\halflife file when you really want the tfc folder because your zipfile doesnt include the tfc in teh tree :)

When you extract it to the C:\Sierra\Half-life directory the files will be put in the right place.  I'll have a site up soon, I'm not very good at making webpages. :(

At the moment I'm really working on the bots using weapons correctly, (ie. - Combat..).  Now I got the Snipers to snipe & Hwguy's to use the Assault Cannon right :)  I also need to work on a new Waypoint Navigation System because this 1 I wrote up in 1 min sux.[/i][/b]

Why cant u use botmans waypoint?
Is it cause your coding was stripped from Botmans Alpha 3?

Get the engi to build an sg!!!
Everyone says its easy for it to make one but i never seen it anywhere!

I used Botmans HPB_Bot Template Source so there was no navigation, & no weapon selection in there I added it all myself from error to error :)

And also the site will be up soon, all I need now is to find a good Server For my page.

You should get it up on a site!
Nice idea that the medic does actually serve its purpose.

I found out from your bot that if there are two medics and another class in the water you cant ever drown!

And that's another idea maybe I could make the Medics follow you for say 120 secs, for cover if you get hurt :)

Ive done that b4 cause me and a mate, he was a HWGUY and i was a Medic and i stood behind him just giving him enegy while he walked and shoot.  Every shot was taken by him not me so i never really got hurt.  
Quite easy cap flags on Epicentre doing that!

you really need a website, it is good to see some competition to botman, just to keep him sharp

bah no compotion is needed, simply beacase no one can work as hard as botman.

The thing is botman is doing this cause its a challange.

Botman works hard because he has to answer this forum, other forum and emails,once done that begin coding his bot.
And lead his real life.

All i can say is botman u have everyone's surport.

Damn i wish i knew how to spell LOL :-)
