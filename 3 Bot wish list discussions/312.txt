I brought this up before and I remember someone else bringing it up.

Why not make your bot compatible with Op4CTF? All you would need to do is make it so they randomly pick teams and classes (which your bot already does for TFC) and just include the code for capturing the flag.

Please! 

If you do not, I will be forced to kill one forum member every half an hour untill my demands are met

Ohhhhhh, if you start shooting people in this forum can I be first?  PLEEEEEEEEEASE! :)

I've looked at a couple of the OpFor CTF maps and most of them look WAY more complicated than the bots can handle.  There are many places where you have to crouch and jump through windows or over railings or use the tenticle to grappel your way up to locations where the flag or capture point is.  There's lots of ladders and buttons that the bots have a hard time dealing with.  In general the whole environment is NOT bot friendly.  I haven't been through all of the OpFor CTF maps so maybe I only randomly picked the worst ones.  Are there any OpFor CTF maps that a nice simple flat layouts with few doors, ladders, water, or other obstacles that things difficult for bots?

Another thing I've noticed about many of the OpFor deathmatch maps is that they are WAY TOO dark.  I crank up the gamma and brightness on my monitor and everything gets washed out and it's still hard to see in many areas.  I can't believe that people like playing in maps that are constantly this dark.

Yeeeah. 

The "way too complicated than bots can handle" phrase got my attention. I know that too,some MODs for example can be too Hard for bots to play well. honest but true. 

It would require brain implants for the bot to get around every complicated obstacle, crouch to spot A & rocket jump to place B and so on or not to do such action at all..., talk & spam (like real humans), change moods (happy, pissed or boring), Truth is that Bots  Brains are lots of IFs and Else´s. =)

I also have a problem with darkness on maps. Its not the maps though, its my lousy monitor :p

I dont think that the snow ctf map is too difficult. It seems they would be able to manage that as long as they dont use the grapple.
