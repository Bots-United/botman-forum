Most of the things I have in mine so far I found out myself but some not?

I'm a newbie at Programming Also but I've been reading books for (1/2) Yr. so far.  I need to take a college course if I wanna get into it I guess. :)_

I can't seem to figure out bots buildin sentries though!

I asked botman this a little bit ago and he said that he knew of someone who was also making one and he said that he would post on his news site when this guy released it
