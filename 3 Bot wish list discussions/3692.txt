Isn't there anyone out there that is working on finishing the MONSTER plugin for MetaMod? BotMan can't do it anymore since he has hardly anytime. So many people wanna spawn GARGANTS and ICTHYOSAUS. I have alot of programming experience unfortunatly with BASIC and PASCAL (Until Next Year When I Start C) so I am going to at least TRY. Oh and is there anyway to stop the helicopter from spinning and constantly flying up?? I wish I could spawn monsters in the air without having to make .cfg with coordinates and everything and to have flying Controllers...Oh well. I'm gonna try to see if I can do anything.
