well I know the first thing somebody is going to post is: BoCBot

well that project is no more and the bot has too many problems for it to be of any use to me.

What I am looking for is somebody to create a bot for Firearms and with a few options

1) Ability to load with dedicated server AND auto-load on EACH map change

2) A simple to use/create waypoint system for creating waypoints (like HPB with the auto-waypoint tool)

3) Bots arn't completly stupid (you don't have to shoot them before they notice you)

4) Bots can aim well and with settings for changing the bot reaction time so that you have a chance even when they aim for the head.

mainly these bots will be used to training and practice, I promise a 24/7 dedicated server for testing and not only myself but a few of my members for testing / bug reporting.

If I could code myself I certainly would, but I know more about VB then I do C++ so thats not really a good option for me.

Please if anybody could spare even the time to convert HPB for firearms that would be awesome.

It is actually Military Command bot and Marine_bot that are under development.
Thanks Pierre, Yeah I will get all the SDK's in a week and we will see what I can do about it :-) But I have gotten interested in coding now so I reckon this will be a bot that will be kept on in the production lab...

And Sorry that I'm under noob Coder instead of Sweeper, Expect a change when I'm on with coding..

Yeah I think I will need testers, I'm also wanting brutal ones that really takes the software to the limit...

Contact me? I'm everywhere www.ausfx.com www.firearmsmod.com www.politicsforum.org www.ja-galaxy-forum.com

On thoose sites I am known as Sweeper... Not so hard not to meet ;)

Not anymore at www.nuclearbox.com
Still I am looking for a host though so...

I also have E-mails:
Mercenary_aim_@hotmail.com (Best to use, also for MSN)
Sweeperthemerc@Yahoo.no (Mobile mail, access when travelling)

So there you have me, Ausfx is the site where I am most active (2000 posts anyone?)
So if you got a question contact me but not any HUGE mails... Hotmail hates them and I will never get it :( Lovely getting something else than all that forum reply mails I usually get :)
