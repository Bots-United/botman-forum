once the hpb bot came out there were dozens of ones that spun off at the same time that were aimed at strictly counterstrike play.  how come there arent more toward tfc.  from what i have read at the site, i think that it would be interesting to play the nnbot in tfc.  does anyone agree with me or am i completly off my rocker

There is one other person who is working on a TFC bot.  They and I have been sending e-mails back and forth every once in a while.  There isn't a website set up yet (so don't ask for a URL) and the last I heard the bot was several weeks away from being released, but as soon as I get news that another TFC bot is available, I'll put a link to the site on my Links page and post a news item about it.

I do aswell.
CS is TOO realistic in some areas(or very stupid)

It also takes a LONG time to load (at least on my machine).

the reason CS takes too long to load is because the code and stuff is not as optimized as TFC's code

I am making a TFC bot.
I have alredy got a (very) smal website. The bot will have a special learning code. It will learn form battles and if you exit TFC it will save his skills for the next game the bot will play in.
I think the first release will come 2 weeks after botman uploads the new version of the HPB_bot.

No, I wasn't him. And you don't have to be impressed by my website becouse I am still working on it. And I haven't got much time to work on it. I will make the website better when I have the time.

all i was saying was dont go around pushing your site when it is barely a page and there is no information, there is more information on it now so i think that your bot might be a legit project, keep working because it looks good

Man, Ares, your bot looks like it may be pretty sweet. I like the menu you have, it looks really user-friendly. I wanna see how your bot turns out, because it looks like it might be damn good.
