O.K this is my unofficial review of this mod. Please take note, that all of DoD's reviews were positive. Not one was negative. Please remember this.
Download - horribly huge. 70 megs. LONG WAIT.
Graphics - Superb. Textures, Models, Maps ets. are all very nicely done. NO question.
Maps - Great gameplay and look good. Just a few touchups.
Gameplay - Fast-paced teamplay. Let's just say it feels EXACTLY like Saving Private Ryan.
Bugs - One major bug is the spawn bug ( if you play it you will now what it is when it happens to you ), but other than that it's pretty bug-free.
Internet Play - has great netcode, but is still affected by lag. I do good, but a bot for others ( and myself *ahem* ) would be perfect.
Overall, this mod can soon have more servers than TFC. After a few more patches... WOW! This is a professional ( almost ) mod. I suggest reading the many reviews for it and deciding if you want to make the bot or not. Trust me. There was all ready 200 server sready for play on THE FIRST DAY. It will grow; I guaranteee it. BTW Go download it.
OTHER NOTES:
- Includes the following weapons
Colt 1911 ( Standard Allied Sidearm )
M1 Garand ( Allied Rifle - powerful )
Bren Sub-Machine Gun ( Allied )
BAR ( Allied Heavy Machine Gun )
Frag Grenade ( Allied )
Springfield ( Allied Sniper Rifle )
Luger ( German standard sidearm )
Gewehr ( Axis Rifle - Accurate and powerful )
MP-40 ( Axis sub )
MP-44 ( Axis heavy rifle )
Sniper rifle
Stielhand ( Axis Stick Grenade )
Knife
-Netcode
-Realistic damage
-Rare bandaging times (Meaning the only time you have to bandage is once in a VERY RARE while. You almost never bleed because (a) You'll either be killed outright and (b) The wound will be too serious to bandage fast enough.) The bandage also is quick. Just press one button.
-Intricate radio system
-GREAT SOUNDS!
-Good, VERY LARGE, maps.
-Good teamplay
-Stamina system (Doesn't do any good for you to jump anyway; you will most definitely be shot.
-Easy levels to waypoint (Must add defend and storm waypoint like in FLF)
-Easy to learn objectives ( like just capping territory by walking over the flag )
Basically, this mod is great for everyone. I recommend that EVERYONE go download it ( I'm on 56k and I downloaded it in about 3 1/2 hours )
So anyways, botman, please consider adding DoD support; I don't think it would be too hard, since you all ready have all the defend/cap code in FLF. BUT, play it first COMPLETELY! Then decide.
Thanks for reading.

Yes, I have played DoD and ran into several problems with the initial release.  See this...

http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=1057

I had ZERO problems with the first release of Front Line Force.

This MOD is good if you like realistic gameplay MODs.  I don't like realistic gameplay MODs.  I don't like MODs where one or two shots from a weapon will kill you.  I don't like Counter-Strike because you have to sit out the game for 5 minutes waiting for all the campers to die after you get killed 5 seconds into the round.

I love MODs with wild and crazy weapons with almost no realistic gameplay.  Half-Life deathmatch is GREAT with the egon gun, gauss gun, and snarks.  Rocket Crowbar is just plain HILARIOUS!

Unfortunetly everyone seems to be making realistic game play MODs lately (except Arg!).  Nobody seems to be making MODs with jetpacks and vehicles that shoot snarks.  Nobody is making a MOD with freeze rays or guns that shoot sticky stuff to slow the player down.  Nobody is making a MOD with Holo-Duke type decoys where you can toss out a virutal image of yourself to fool the enemy into thinking that it's you.  Nobody is making a MOD with a hyperspace button to allow you quickly "warp" out of any danger areas.  Nobody is making a MOD where weapons will occasionally blow up in your face and kill you instead of the enemy.

If somebody comes out with a unique MOD that doesn't have the same gameplay as everything else out there then I'll probably add that MOD to the HPB bot.  I'm not impressed by having lots of weapons (if they are all realistic projectile firing weapons).  I'm not impressed by having realistic sound effects.  I am VERY unimpressed when a MOD is released and it crashes frequently or has severe lag (like OpFor) or has very poorly done maps (bad weapon placement, same old textures, high rspeeds, etc.)

I won't be adding DoD support to the HPB bot.  I don't add things to the HPB bot to make everyone else happy.  I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.  I add things that I want to see added.  The reason that I released my source code in the first place was to allow people to add a bot to MODs that I wasn't willing to create a bot for.

o my gosh botman, i thought i was the only one who likes those kind of mods. everyone is syched when some reality mod comes out, i just say no way.  i like mods where the lesser real the better. fantacy is better than reality in my opinion

 i just like whatever they do a good job an has a good fun factor , but it doesnt matter if it is real or not , hehe maybe they could make a fantasy guns mod with realist deaths to it? or vice versa , that would be TFC....well sorta

"Rocket Crowbar is just plain HILARIOUS!"

Yes it`s a really great mod! What about adding improved RC support to the HPB_Bot (cuz the RC-ingame bot sux)


"Unfortunetly everyone seems to be making realistic game play MODs lately (except Arg!)."  

I think TFC is the perfect solution. Realistic game elements mixed with cool things like the tranqualizer gun.

"I don't add things to the HPB bot to make everyone else happy.  I'm not trying to win a popularity contest."

Then i don`t understand why you`ve added CS support it`s a realistic mod isn`t it and you said that you don`t like it !?!?!

Well from my position: I like a mod depending if it`s fun or not. If realistic or unrealistic doesn`t matter to me. So i hope anyone else will make a DOD Bot, we`ll see......
