i use botmans bots for opfor and they kick ass. however, i just got goldeneye for half life and i cant get botmans bots to work on it . bots for goldeneye would totally own and totally above all kickass. i don't get to go on the net very often so i use bots. would it be possible to make bots for goldeneye? its the best and with bots it would be that much better

i mean a program that will automatically add them like botmans where you can change the stuff in the config file and you don't have to use the console to add them.

And the goldeneye bots suck!!! They stand jumping against a wall, and you can safely go up to and blow their head off. Somethimes their walking a random direction, and if they sees you (even trough a small, small hole in the wall) they uses 0.3 seconds to headshot you. They have no waypoints!!!! Come on! Somebody who know how to do it, make a new better bot to them!
