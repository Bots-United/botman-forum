...actually do more than just put your health back up to 100%.
Cant u make it so the bot can heal to a greater %.
ie the hunted can be a maximum of 200%

that would be cool, and get the medic and some other solders and hwguys to stay back to defend the pres. that would be cool

i think its 50 points over maximum so hunted can get up to 100 (200%) and weaklings like scouts get 125 (166% or so)
