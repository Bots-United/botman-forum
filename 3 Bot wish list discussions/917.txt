Botman makes sure that every release doesn't have major bugs, so if he added a sentry point and sentry support for the engineers straight away, then many bugs could be encountered! Let's just do things once at a time, eh?

Yes, the bot shall be able to place sentries sooner or later, and when they do i am sure they will Know how to upgrade them and point them correctly. All in due time i am sure.

funny way of putting it but I think he meant spys shouldnt be so agressive and actually disguise themselves

hey!! dont flame just because im not speaking english that well (take a look at my signature).
what i meant was that spies act like hwg - they just follow their waypoint and start shooting when a enemy is detected (that sux, they should disguise them selves and not be a soldier but a spy!!
