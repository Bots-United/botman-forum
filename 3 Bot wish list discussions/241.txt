Yes, if you play as a spy, don't try to fool the bots.  They're too smart for that!  :)

I'll try to fix that problem in a future release of the HPB bot, for now just don't disguise as the other team.

If you have been disguised then you could go into an observer mode until you throw a grenade near an enemy or shoot etc...

Man, I'm full of ideas today!

nope.

type "observer 1" and no bots will shoot you but the bots will shoot other bots, unlike the "botdontshoot" command!
