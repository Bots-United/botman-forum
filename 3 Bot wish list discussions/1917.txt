1st thought, is to do with FLF.
Do you think that maybe you'll ever try & give the bots the ability to speak the messages so that you could hear/see their mouths move. 

2nd thought "FLF" ..
I'm rusty with FLF, but their's a map that the bots need to destroy things on. I opened my manual, ok it's "flf_chion" ..  Are you possibly planning for future support to have them play this map?

One last question, waypoint menu has # "3 Prone".
If i add that it means the bots would lay down? I know i should just try it.. And i will as soon as i'm done with this post. ;-)

In ending i'd just like to say that the HPB plays FLF Great!! I downloaded a waypoint pack from the warehouse a while back & a little tweeking here & their is needed, but they're as [Pizza]MonkeyBoy would say - "Fragalicious"! 8D
************************************************************
Now about tfc.
Seems the other 2 bots (FoXBot & Oddbot) have done script type files to help the bots do maps like cz2, warpath, Avanti .. etc. etc. To help the bots better do the command points.
Do you think that maybe you'll go the same route & implament some sort of scripting system to have the bots better understand these type of maps?

Please note that i'm NOT saying "because they are doing it that you should also follow suite" .. Just curious if you might try and throw something together that would help the HPB_bot better understand such things. There's little tricks that can be done as i see how Cheesemonster does this in warpath & dustbowl AND i believe mooncheese.. So it's pretty important! But i guess it could be avoided.. 
That's all i can think of at the moment.. 8-) THX botman!

"Do you think that maybe you'll ever try & give the bots the ability to speak the messages so that you could hear/see their mouths move."

Do players do this when they chat?  I've never played FLF on an Internet server so I don't know if they do this or not.  If they do then obviously something else is happening between the server and the client other than just sending the text message.  I'll have to look into it and see.

"Are you possibly planning for future support to have them play this map?"

I probably won't do much more with FLF other than to support new entities as they get added to future releases of FLF (so the server won't crash).

"If i add that it means the bots would lay down?"

No, I was going to add a prone feature to the HPB bot (that's why I added it to the waypoint menu), but currently the bots don't know how to go prone.  I may add this in a future release of the HPB bot if I run out of other stuff to add in.  :)

I have always wanted to add some kind of sequence tag to the waypoints so that they understand that some things have to be done in a certain order.  This will help make some maps more playable (like pushing a button THEN going through a door), but probably won't help much with maps where you have to capture things in a certain order especially if the other team is uncapturing those same things in the reverse order.  The sequence thing is a little difficult since you could have more than one set of sequenced waypoints in a map (i.e. one set may be push button then go through door, another set in the same map may be turn valve then go down into acid filled pool (now drained)).  It will be difficult integrating this waypoint sequence tag with the existing waypoint structure.  If I change the structure I need to do so in such a way that the older waypoint files will still work properly.
