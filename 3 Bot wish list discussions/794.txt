Due to my limited bandwidth I'd like to restrict human players to 5. If I set maxplayers to 16 I need to have min_bots 11 to limit human players to 5. The problem is that I want all the bots on one team and 11 (max_bots) is a bit much if there are only a few humans. A max_human setting would allow me to lower the min_bots and add bots as humans join.

Just a couple of observations. 

Players say how dumb and easy to kill the bots are (skill setting is 1) but don't seem to realize/care that the bots are capping and winning (I don't have much time with them yet, 2fort is where I noticed).

Cpu usage 70-80%, looks like 11 bots 5 humans is pushing both my box and my bandwidth (Linux dedicated and 128kb up limited cable)

not a bad idea...I like to run a listenserver with 8 slots for bots and 8 slots for humans.

What kind/speed CPU do you have?  How much RAM?

K62 300/128

It looks like I lied. The worst I saw tonight was slightly over 70% on flagrun. Flagrun is noticably the most cpu intensive map I run.

16-20 bots is about the max you can get out of a 300 Mhz processor without getting some serious lag.  I've got at PII 300 w/64 Meg and usually run about 12-16 bots when testing.

Back to the original question, I think the best way to do what you want is to have a scaling factor on the min and max bots settings.  For example if you have between 1 and 5 players add 2 bots.  If you have between 6 and 10 players add 4 bots.  If you have 11 to 20 players add 6 bots, etc.  I'll look into whether it would be fairly easy to change the max_bots and min_bots stuff and make it based on the number of human players (and still be able to support the way that it currenly works).

I run rh linux on celery 300A w/64 megs ram. Running web server, e-mail server, ftp server etc.
hlds_l with a map voting system (hlds_ld) and the HPB_bot. 8 real players, 4 bots. With all of the crap running on this box my free CPU ranges between 44 and 49%. Memory is another story, using 60 megs memory and 35 megs swap. The half life server with all its features uses 50% of my memory and cpu.

This information taken from the "top" program in rh7.0

Don't sweat the scaling factor. After a few nights I have realized that mixed teams are better, you need humans to throw in some unpredictability.

Are there any waypoint discussions? I've noticed things like:

casabah - The bots never? go upstairs, easy cap route.

flagrun - Killer bot defence inside the forts.

badlands - The bots always go the bridge route.

2fort - Pretty good but bots always go for flag and don't hassle the snipers. Unusual amount of water traffic.

crossover2 - Pretty good though the bots seem to get stuck in the water if you blow them off the bridge. Snipers seem to fall to the basement after 1 shot from cap point.

dustbowl and avanti - Not to good, bots don't handle stages of defence (and don't cover the underground on the last dustbowl cap).

On 16 - 20 max bots. My first experience with bots was on a server with 20 bots and the lag was incredible.

On the K62 300/503+. It has been an excellent box for everything and should continue to be an excellent server for some time to come (if I could figure out why my 700 Duron/KT7/Raedon locks up I'd be a happy camper).

On RH. As you said 50% cpu for HL w/bots. I also run a bunch of other servers/stuff and the average load on my box is almost nothing (currently cpu 1.5%, load .02). When running a HL server w/ bots I see anywhere from 30+ - 70+% cpu depending on the map (/.wpt?) and number of players/bots. I have no complaints, just observing that bots need a bit of cpu.

Botman, I wonder if a chatroom would help reduce the noise level on these boards (or maybe -10 posts for every pointless one :).
