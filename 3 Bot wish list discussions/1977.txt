i have been waypointing the maps for opposing force CTF for the last week and i can get the bot to capture the flag and stuff but the bots dont know how the barnacle gun works ,they dont even use it in combat and you need it  to get things like the penguins in op4ctf_wonderland, possibly you cauld add a feature like a sniper waypoint and they fire the barnacle in the direction you were facing when you placed waypoint,this cauld be very usefull in maps like biodomes as the bots havn,the the best of skill in the art of jumping off ladders

No, the barnacle gun is too difficult for the bots to use properly.  I've tried making it work, but the problem isn't attaching to a point and getting pulled towards it, the problem is knowing when to let go (and which way to drop after letting go).

Sniper aiming is easy, you just stand there and aim in a general direction waiting for someone to come by.  The barnacle gun is harder to use than ladders (and ladders are pretty simple for humans, but a big pain in the ass for bots).

yeah i know,are you going to be working how the bots use ladders ,they can get on well enough its just getting off is the problem. A good example of this is in op4ctf_biodoms ,you should try and get the bots up the big ladders and off again safely. I tried for about 3 hours one day and the bots only made it off in about once in 50 tries

after the third hour of that crap I said "ah F**k this!"

I am always working on trying to get the bots to become better at using things in the map.  Things like ladders, water, jump pads, buttons for elevators or lasers, moving platforms, breakable objects like windows or crates, and mounted sentry guns are all things that I would eventually like to be able to get the HPB bot to use efficiently.  However, none of these things are easy to get the bots to use.

There are about 2 or 3 dozen different areas where I would like to improve the HPB bot's skills, but I don't have time to work on all of these all at once.  I pick one or two items and work on those until I am happy with them (not until they are the best they can be, just until the work well enough for me), then I add them to the next release.  Then I'll pick another one or two items and work on those.  Sometimes I'll go back to something I had worked on several months before and work on improving that a little bit more.  The whole process takes time, a lot of time.  There aren't very many bots that do all of these things well because there aren't that many people that have the time to spend working on all of these things.

Just be patient and things will get better a little at a time.
