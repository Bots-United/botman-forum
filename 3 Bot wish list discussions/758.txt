why don't you get a few yourselves together and perhaps botman too, if he's got some time, and get on a server and take out your frustrations that way. Heck you could even spawn a few of the bots at the same time :)

Botman seems to have a strange visualisation that everyone has a static ip address....

Once I get the latest patch (Im at 1101 and need 1104) than I will kick all your arses!

Here will be the deal, I will host the server. It will be password protected (Ill reveal the password once I get the latest pacth), AND anyone from the forum can join in. It will be on map "2fort" or "The well". 

When ready, Ill post the date, time and password. And if not many people show up, Ill fill the rest of the server with bots.

I take challenges seriouisly 8)

One last thing, I will be ALONE on the blue team, everyone that joins the server will have to be on the red team (well, I might have 1 or 2 bots on my team to make things fair).

Ill be back once Im done downloading [SM]:)[/SM]

It'd be good if btman made a client side bot {^_^}
Only problem would be that everyone wuld have to have the same client.dll
