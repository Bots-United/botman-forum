Now that TFC , FLF , HLDM , OPDM and HolyWars are all resonably good (they play the game well enough).
Does that mean you will now start improving the CS bots ?
Ive been thinking that you may as well remove it becuase you have done very little to the bots.
I think pretty much everyone just wants the HPB Bot for TFC or FLF etc and that no one would mind if you got rid of the CS Bots.
I know its only like 40 bytes or something so wouldnt save any room but still.
Then again its your bot so  you can do what the hell you like :)
