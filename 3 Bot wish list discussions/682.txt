There are several people at my office that know who I am and what I do, but only 2 of them actually play Half-Life and MODs.  We get together every once in a while and have a LAN fragfest and I usually get my butt kicked!  :)

I spend so much time coding/testing the bots that I don't get much time to actually play on-line.  My style of playing has been effected by how the bots play and I have a hard time switching modes to deal with real human players.

I don't do any of this for the fame and fortune (I haven't seen ANY of the fortune yet).  I do it because I think it's fun.  On the day that it stops being fun, I'll hang up my mouse, stop making bots, and move on to something else. 8)

Oh ppl means people O.K.

Well Botman i think you should add more teamplay to your bots. In CS they should go in groups of three and storm houses together etc. .But they should take care of each other, so there is one bot looking back, one bot sniping and one who opens the doors and storm in. That should solve your Bot<->Realplay problems.

Uhh actually Botman is the person who created the Half-Life mod bot craze... if it wasn't for him there would be no bots for Half-Life mods...
