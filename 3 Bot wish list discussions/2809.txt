I think almost every MP3 player for Half-Life is based on FMOD...

http://www.fmod.org/

It seems to be pretty straight forward, load the DLL, map the functions (using GetProcAddress), then call the functions to play, pause, etc. the tracks.  You only have to develop the user interface you want to use.

I do believe that this REQUIRES you to have a soundcard the supports full duplex audio channels (otherwise Half-Life will have exclusive access to the sound stream).  Most older 8 bit or 16 bit sound cards don't have drivers that support full duplex audio channels.
