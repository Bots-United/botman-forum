Botman,
firstly, i must say you rock.
secondly, for your included waypoints would it be possible to include a text file indicating when they were created/modified and who by.

and anyone from waypoint warehouse reading.. would it be possible for the creation/modified time to be added on the list??

i think it would just help out us gamers deciding if we need to download new files or not :)

ya me too, the waypoints i make usually turn out to be the best of all, some of the other guys who make them never even take the time to try them out fully and don't know what happens in battles.

I know godamn well you aren't talking about me, because i test my waypoints out a lot. And i have been playing TF since you were in grade school. So i know that i know how the battles flow.
