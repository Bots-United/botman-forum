Whatcha think botman.. Think maybe something to think about? What i mean is when i'm online once & a while you'll see a player lag out & go into like a suspeneded state.. Frozen in time.. They can be beaten & infected till there armor disapears. Then when -0 They dead if they regian connection. So it's nothing to do with bots latency of 5, let's just pretend that a bot's connection has been broken for a few.. hehe.. But if you do decide this might be something intresting to do "If Possible", then i think maybe you should probably add a switch in the bot.cfg so people could turn on or off this function, incase they don't like it.  

So whatcha think? If yes then of course you should have it in each mod. If no, well atleast i thought of something different.. ;D

ps, 1.6a ROCKS!!!! Thank You! If ya ask me, i think they build those sg's ALOT faster now.. Lots of Great improvement i see besides that though.. ;)

I had better add to that this would be like a pretty rare occurance if it were a 30min round. So you'd probably only maybe see 1 lag, sometimes but rare 2 in that 30mins.. That's the way i'd say it be.. Anyone else think so..?

this is actually a 'way' to code lag... nice idea.. i'll think about this for my own bot :)

hmm, well, some players who have very instable connections lag more then others. I think adding a 'lag' variable to the bot will make this more real so that real laggy bots simply lag per 2 seconds (for example) and some bots do not lag at all.

Of course when they lag it'll be possible to send them a sweet headshot via the AWP right.? 
That'll come in handy for this map --> http://csmaps.zeroping.com/engine_files.cfm?Page=4&File=3849 ;D

But even so if you do have this lag thing in the next version of your bot, even when playing above map for 30mins say, i'd probably only would expect to see it happen maybe once.. Right.? Ya think.? Maybe twice.?

Why the heck would you want the bots to lag ?

Good question.

If you like lag so much then you should be playing on an Internet server.  I myself HATE lag and don't see why you would want to be frustrated that way.

he wants the bots to lag.... not himself. if he wanted to lag him self he could just use fakelag. he wants the bots to lag  so that it is more like a real internet server. and even have some bots that freeze from time to time
