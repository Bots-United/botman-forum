What we all want in a bot (simple question)
Lets give it a skill of 1 to 5 where 1 is the easiest and 5 de harder:

In lvl 1: we want the bots to miss alot... i.e.: you are running away from 3 bots and the bullets hit right next to you... in the wall... everywhere... like a james bond movie.
also the bots should stay in one place like guard for lots of time so you can come and back stab them and watch them blead to dead!!! (use lower power weapons too)

In lvl. 2: We want the bots to hit more (BUT NOT IN THE HEAD like in some mods where in skill 1 bots sucks and skill 2 the kill you with one shot)
in the arms and legs... (use lower power weapons and grenades) 

In lvl. 3: the bots should rarely hit in the head but snipe and take cover when fighting, but not yet fight in groups. (use all weapons if awaible)

In Lvl. 4: The bots should move in at least groups of two and duck and cover... but make amush and stay more in a defensive position...
(use all weapons of course)

In lvl. 5: Atack alot in groups 70% of the team... the other 30% defensive... jump... duck and try to dodge and hit in the head alot (when enemy close enough and duck...

That's it... the perfect bots!!
