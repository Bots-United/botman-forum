and more importantly Battle of the Millennium!

Actually I think you WANT a bot for Gangsta Wars and Battle of the Millennium.  There's a difference.  There is none for either one of these MODs as far as I'm aware.  I won't be adding bot support to either of these MODs.  Anybody else want to create a bot for any of these?

botm has its own bot too, but it's like alpha 1.. it sux totally. i guess i gave up on that mod when i've waited 6 months for a new version and still got nothing.
