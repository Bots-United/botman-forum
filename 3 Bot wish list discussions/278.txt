The bots (at least in Opfor) often use the glock, even if they have the shotgun, or mp5...
and they aim directly for the head, killing you in a sec if u dont like to strafe...

Yeah, I'll have to agree. None of Botman's bots really have realistic aiming (sorry). It seems all they do is lock onto you and shoot, there's no way to avoid their shots because they are like locked on.

I agree to! It also happens when you blow the bots into the air and they still have perfect aim!

You can adjust the bot skill level in the bot.cfg file.  If you want them to have fewer headshots change the skill level from 2 to 4 or 5.

It's not really headshot kinda thing, it's more of a perfect shot in the middle of your chest while on fire and in mid-air kinda thing. I think it would help if you put in a randomizer thing. Like it randomized the bot skill levels.

That will be available once I make a bot_weapon.txt file to make the weapon usage configurable.  You will be able to set the base accuracy level and be able to set the percentage of time each lower skill level is used.  For example...

skill_1_aiming_percent = 10
skill_2_aiming_percent = 30
skill_3_aiming_percent = 50
skill_4_aiming_percent = 10

10% of the time it will get headshots, 30% of the time head/body, 50% of the time body shots and 10% of the time barely hitting anything at all.

I think that would be better this way:
25% - miss
75% - hit

25% of the hits- legs or arms
35% - body
30% - chest
10% - head

Its only an idea, I dont know how the aiming system for the bots work, and I dont know how to make bots.... =P

And using the navigation system can u make the bots strafe?

You don't have that kind of control over the shots.  The weapons in the MOD have a random spread.  Some MODs (like CS) have accuracy based on other factors (like player speed, jumping, falling, crouching, etc.).  You can't guarantee a head shot or arm shot or leg shot.  All you can do is adjust how accurately the crosshairs are positioned (at the head, chest, legs).  Sometimes when you aim at the head, you hit the chest.  Sometimes when you aim at the chest you hit the head.

The bots movement is controled by 2 parameters you pass into an engine function.  One of these controls how fast the bot goes forward (or backwards) and the other controls how fast they move to the right (or left).  Currently I only use the forward movement (the side movement is set to zero).  The bots will face in the direction they want to go and run forward at full speed all the time (except when they are pausing).

You could make the bots circle strafe or zig-zag as they run along.  I don't play this way and haven't attempted to make the bots play this way either.  TheFatal (of Jumbot) made an interesting comment several months ago that bot makers tend to make bot play the same way that the authors play.  Making them play any other way seems unnatural and weird.  If I ever do try to make the bots strafe it will definitely be something that can be turned off.  I absolutely HATE it when the bots play that way.
