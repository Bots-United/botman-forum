Hey Botman, did you go to any sites to learn how to put this bullenton board on the web? If so, where?

/me is having a bit of trouble getting it working...

No, I just downloaded it and installed it according to the directions in the readme.txt file.  I did have to change a few of the file permissions to make what gamespy.com recommended for executables.  YaBB said use "chmod 755" for YaBB.pl and "leave as is" for the Sources Perl files, but these should all be "chmod 710".

Make sure your directories are all "chmod 777" and your .dat and .txt files are all "chmod 666".  When transfering the .txt files make SURE to transfer them in ASCII mode and when transferring the .dat files make SURE to transfer them in BINARY mode.
