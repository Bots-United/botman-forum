I would rather you not.  Gamespy.com is nice enough to host my webpage.  They make the money necessary to buy servers, disks, network bandwidth, etc. from the advertising.  If everyone downloads my stuff from your site, they don't get the advertising revenue.  I don't get a penny from the ads on my site, but please don't take anything away from gamespy.
