I think I told this to Botman quite a while ago, but Im using his Bot #9 in my mod Arsenal.

I just recieved the hard news from my coder;

the bot will not be included in the first release due to unexpected errors and lack of time.

NNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Me wants bots! Me game is crap without bots!

Sorry to post this on this forum, but you dont have a Bot Gerneral Discussion forum (Hint, hint).

Sorry to hear that mate, well keep it up dude!!
Dont let it bother, just think it this way: now you have more time to "tweak" the code :) and make it even more better!
