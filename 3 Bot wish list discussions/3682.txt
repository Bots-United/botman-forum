This question has been asked like probably over 5 times here. Check previous threads. But anyway's, as far as i know there is no bots for S&I..

The ODDbot is a dead project now & the Creator "Spyro" said he just got lucky that his bot supported S&I, he never intentionaly added support for it. But that was Loooooong ago.. I think it was around maybe the 2nd or 3rd version of S&I.

To bad S&I don't download botman's source & create a bot for their mod themselves. There's something maybe you should ask them to do.

VS "www.planethalflife.com/vampire/Vampire Slayer" created a bot useing botman's source & so did "www.planethalflife.com/globalwarfare/Global Warfare"..

Yup, you should ask their coder if he'd code in some bots.. I'd even download it then.. ;D

Sorry, but I read in the forums of S & I, that they find that the game has to be played online and don't want to create a bot for it.

One of their forum-members once created a simple bot for it, but it's already discontinued.
