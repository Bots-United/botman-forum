Keep in mind this thread was created 2 YEARS ago.  Some stuff has changed since then, but it should get you started in finding out what you will need and what you need to learn about.

There already is an <b>ESF</b> bot out. Also, <b>DMZ v1.8</b> comes with it's own bot so there is no need to make one for it.
