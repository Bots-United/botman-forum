The new HPB bot kicks some serious ass! It puts up a damn good fight!

I dont think their is anything more I could want in this bot.

Well, thats not true. It would be kinda cool if the bots could fly.....

Or make the bots strafe would also be good. Flying would be awesome, lighting even better, but strafing.... DAMN!!!

Yes house, i think that the grenade thing was part of the latest patch.  It was to stop the "Spectator grenade exploit"  Maybe it was the patch before that, i dunno.

Wouldnt sg's mean you would have to have sg spots so that the engi's only build sg in certain places rather than randomly?

Yes, but they could also just place them randomly.  Remember, BOTS ARE STUPID!  :)
