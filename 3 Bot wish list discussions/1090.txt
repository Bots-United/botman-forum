OK in another thread Botman told me that he is working on getting the bots to spray logos in the next version when they start building sg's etc. He told me that the logos will come from the /logo directory (you know where the ones that came with the game are). So I brought up a point about the color logos and those being a .wad file that are pre made textures, not .bmp files like the ones that came with the game. I am trying to convince him that basing the logo spray on the pldecal.wad file would be better. Heck, probably easier for botman to set up too. 

What do you guys think, wouldn't it be better if they spray the full color logos that we've all learned to make from reading the color logo tutorial at http://www.cyber-rat.com?

I even offered to make a Botman's Bots color logo that he could use as the default spray for bots. The bots would spray that advertisement unless the server admin changed replaced the pldecal.wad file.

Comments please? I'm hoping enough of you express an interest in this to get Botman's attention. K?
