Is it possible for you to add a "Botton waypoint"to the waypoint tags menu?

You mean "Button"?

That was in there originally, but I found that I don't really need a specific button tag for a waypoint.  If you place a waypoint fairly close to a button AND get the bot to approach the button head on (by placing another waypoint a bodylength or so straight out from the first waypoint and deleteing all but one of the waypoint paths), the bot will "see" the button and will press it.

The real problem with buttons is that they are usually linked to something else (like a door).  The HPB bot has no concept of a sequence of events (FIRST you press then button, THEN you go through the door).

What I really need to do is have some method of sequencing waypoints so that the bots KNOW that they have to do things in a certain order.  There's just not very many situations where this is required so it hasn't been real high on my priority list of things to do.
