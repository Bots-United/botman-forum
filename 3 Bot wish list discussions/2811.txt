Hmpf.

You're a programmer, aren't you ?

So download one of the open-source CS bots source code and add the stuff by yourself. It's not so hard, though.

hahaha in fact i'm a very good programmer best for my age i know every language from html (hyper text  markup language) to Java to C to C++ to MSVC++ and everything else and i need to kick some clan but hehe and anyway I Don't have any programming programs know where i can get a free c++ editor i'm 13 here in Nj it cost 250.00 for c++

I made one but it was crap and just drove round in circles... and at the time I was a n00b programmer :)

damn, you must be a Gooooooooooood in programming and Ze UlTiMaTe lEEt HaX0r aren't you ? So if you are a very good programmer WHY (and this is a question I expect an answer for) don't you do it yourself ? Don't ever tell us that's because you haven't found any colorful C++ editor ! When I was 13, I was doing my programs with DOS edit and some years later it took a long time I give up EditPad Pro (shareware) and the Borland compiler (free) to MSVC !!!

Continue to make us rolling on the floor laughing Louis. I'm not even certain you would write a correct Hello World in C++, on the way you are talking about yourself.

By the way. Make bots use a vehicle is simple.
1-Make them detect the vehicle entity (tools exist for you to know which one it is)
2-Make them head up to it (simple: set yaw)
3-When close to (use vector lengths), make them climb in it (square to vehicle then IN_JUMP)
4-Make them take control of the vehicle (pBot->pEdict->v.button |= IN_USE once)
5-Make the program avoid to process standard bot nav code and process vehicle steering stuff instead (just like BotOnLadder() does it for ladders)
6-Add enemy detection and shootup stuff to the previous code.

To the eventual programmer: Good luck
To the l33t H@X0r you are: you can write this in five seconds, can't you ?

I'm still laughing... It would have be more simple to say "hello, I'm 13, I'm new in here, I don't know very much in bot programming but I do want to learn, could someone tell me some hints to help me in coding stuff that would make bots use vehicles ? Thanks very much for your help." But I forgot you're the UlTiMaTe LeEt CoDeR, you surely don't need any help from a newbie like me. And I AM a newbie in programming. But not a lamer. At least, I think so.

There is a big problem with making find the vehicle controls becasue they don't seem to be detected by FiindEntityByClassName/FindEntityInSphere

Thats the entity "func_vehiclecontrols" or whatever.. That was my prob, so it made it 100 times harder.

The vehicle controls are probably like the brush model used for the func_train controls in single player.  Since brush models will always have (0,0,0) for the origin, you have to use the mins and maxs values to calculate the world origin.

You should be able to loop through the entities by name (UTIL_FindEntityByClassname), then calculate the origin yourself using the same thing VecBModelOrigin() does (using average of mins and maxs) to determine what the world origin of the vechicle controls would be.

Cheesy > If my memory is not false, they ARE detected by UTIL_FindEntity()'s. They just don't spawn in the result of the 'search' function because this one looks for VISIBLE entities in player's neighbourhood. I also saw this behaviour when trying to look for doors origins, and train controls. So I made a 'asearch' clientcommand that would report ALL entities (visible or not) in player's neighbourhood. Then, as Botman said, you can use VecBModelOrigin() to get approximatively an origin for this entity. That's what I did with door origins (look in the Bot programming questions forum for the thread 'door detection'). It's not too hard, after all.

Well Okay I might try it again :) The only problem is that CS quits when you try to debug.... which makes it much harder to fix problems.
