Botman, did you ever play Rocket Crowbar?  I'll stop the questioning right there before I go too far and bother you with another "can you add support for such-and-such mod?".

Yes, I LOVE Rocket Crowbar!  I was always going to add RC to the list of MODs supported by the HPB bot, but I have always wanted to improve the skills in regular Half-Life (like using mounted turret guns in stalkyard, or knowing how to long jump or gauss jump to hard to reach areas, etc.) before I tried to add another deathmatch MOD (although DMC seemed like it was too easy to pass up).  One thing I used to like about Rocket Crowbar was that the MOD never changed.  For a long time there was only this one release (that barely had any bots at all).  Now they've begun changing the MOD and that makes it much more difficult to support.  MODs that go through lots of changes in a short amount of time trying to attract more people makes it very difficult for bot developers to keep up with the changes.  It's very easy for a person to get used to a new weapon or new item or new method of game play.  It's very hard for a bot to do that.  I may yet add support for Rocket Crowbar, but I wish they would get to a version that they were happy with and leave things at that.
