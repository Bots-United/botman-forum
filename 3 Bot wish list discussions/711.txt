I was thinking bout making a spam waypoint for the bots!!! hehe I know it sounds dumb but to get that full normal experience you would probably have you would want some bastard spammers! Like the sniper waypoints and bots just throw all greandes theyve got. You can make a command to put bot spamming on or off!!!

Hmm maybe you could do it so if the bot hits the point and it can see someone from the other team it would spam. You could use the same code for aiming as for this possibly. Just switching some stuff around. But hey I know nothing about this kind of coding so oh well.

The problem with this is the bots might just run there and spam while the bots aren't on that stage yet. You might get bots spamming there own team...... kinda like newbies.. hey Matt theres an idea for your Teamkiller bot! hehe ;)
