Hello botman and everyone else i want to know if there is a PVK bot if not im turning to you botman becuase your bots are the best.  I want one because i think the mod would be great with a bot. Why not just play it online...well the netcoding is bad and if were good i only get a good connection occasionally with my 56k so could you please make one if not i can understand how buisy you are with the bots you currently have.  And finnallly if anyone reading this knows where i can find one let me know please

I'm not aware of anyone working on a bot for PVK.  There was a discussion here about making a bot for PVK...

I won't be adding other MODs to the HPB bot.  I barely have enough time to work on now.  Everytime I add a new MOD to the HPB bot, I have to keep updating things when a new release of the MOD comes out.  One of the reasons I like Half-Life deathmatch and TFC so much is that Valve doesn't keep releasing a new version every 2 or 3 months, which makes my life easier.  :D

If there was a really unique MOD (i.e. wild wacky weapons and gameplay) that came out that I REALLY loved, I would probably add support for it to the HPB bot.  I thought Arg! was going to be that way, but I just didn't like it very much at all.  I don't care much for DoD, Firearms, PVK, or many of the other MODs that have been released in the last 6 months.
