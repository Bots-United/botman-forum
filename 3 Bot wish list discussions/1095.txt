Can anyone give me a link to where i can find a bot like this? i have TFC-Bot which allows the console in TFC to be printed into an IRC channel. Now all i need is anouther bot that will allow IRC to TFC Communication. A group of servers called JEC has one that they custom made. Thats the only place i know that has what im looking for. Thanks =)

All you need is to use a standard irc client component and parse whats being sent.
