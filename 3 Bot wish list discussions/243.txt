It would make it less of a hastle if the bots would only be a sniper in sniper maps, so that you wouldn't have to manually create the everytime you want to play a map like that.

Yes, that is a known problem and one of the things that I need to be able to parse from the map file structure (to determine which players are valid).

One problem I have is currently the bots keep the same classes they had when a map change occurs.  If you create a soldier, a sniper, an HWguy, a pyro and a medic in the first map.  Those classes are ALWAYS used in all other maps after the time limit.  If you switch to a "sniper only" map then they would all have to change to snipers and the next map to load would have them still all as snipers.  I could probably store the original creation class and pick that class (for that team) if the map allows it, otherwise temporarily pick a random class from the valid classes for that map.  Each team could have different allowed classes (for example in PULL, one team is all snipers and the other team is all civilians).
