Hey, I was just following up on a previous thread, and I think this issue is a pretty valid issue. Aimbots in counterstrike are more common than not. I was wondering if it would be feasable to have some spectator bots that join the game as people join, and go into first person mode to view each person, and check to see if their aiming is somewhere alon the lines of a bot's aiming. So inother words it would check to see if the aiming cursor stuck on the enemy perfectly etc. It could use visible information like where sounds were located, so if the cursor was fixed on the sound origin you could suspect that they were using a sound based aimbot, which is very real to this date. You could have it automatically start a suspicion vote using adminmod or something alike, to ask if the player should be kicked. I believe this is a very real/ possible option, because on some servers there aren't many admins to start the kick votes from suspicious activities, and could be modified to catch the real blatant hackers. Anyway a start in the right direction with this project would be nice, because it would give a foundation for a little weaker programmers like me.

I have some other ideas to mess up aimbot users which I think is possibly valid, not as much as the aimbot detector, and it would be really nice if botman made some small beginning onthis project,  Iam sure alot of us out there would be greatful. The other idea I had was possibly have something that sends fake user, like without a user model, so normal players wouldn't notice anything, but aimbot users that have esp also would see somebody show up, and they would aim at it, and the next thing is send fake informaiton about sounds without actually spawning sounds on the map, like what stripper does just like with 0 strength so normal people couldn't hear them, spawn the "step" sound all over the map in the same concern of the fake player location idea. The OGC hook interprets the origin of sounds, and checks to see if it is a weapon firing or steps, and displays text on the screen at its origin, but at the top rendering level, so you can see it through walls, and it puts color coded boxes over player entities so people can see people in advance, and due to the color coded boxes, they have a huge advantage. Again botman, I would be very greatful if you could attempt to develop something like this, even if it slows servers down.
THANKS

That would be very sweet. Sounds pretty doable too... I don't know enough about the HL mechanics to be for sure though. But I am pretty sure you could do the aimbot thing.

Aaargh robber you stole my secret idea for an anti-cheat ! ;D nevermind anyway, I've no time for it (a bot to grow), so it's OK :)

I don't think it would be needed to create a bot and let him go in spectator mode, it is much more simple to do this :
At each frame, loop through all players, and for each of them issue the following checks :
- Trace a line from this player's view_ofs, in the direction of his v_angle
- Does this traceline ends up on the <b>exact</b> center of another player entity (i.e. the exact head / the exact body ?) - even more if we ignore walls...
- Does the v_angle changed in a 'inhuman' way ?
- Add your ideas here...

However I don't think it would be a good idea Botman did a little work on aimbots, because many greedy lamers would certainly rip off his code to build their own aimbot, i.e. exactly the contrary of what we want. I know Count Floyd did try to code a client-side bot, I think he succeeded but he never released anything, thanks God for that ! ;D

If you have a problem with ripping code I am actually pretty experienced at fixing that. YAY, I have taken a course in encryption algorithms and c++. Lets say I know how to keep the petty hackers out of a file. I am no specialist though, one trek assembler freaks could figure it out though =(. But I don't believe there are hackers that have that skill, and waste their time on games, they have bigger fish to fry.
Only release the plugin with decent encrypiton in a compiled .dll do not release the source. To add more security, purposely make the code obvious to be detected if ripped. Anyway OGC is already made cs a hugely augmented gameplay, Color coded boxes, self hooking, undetectable (for now, possibly with some help not for long), and essentially nobody would settle for a standalone aimbot, they will go for the big guns. Also there isn't really anything like the aimbot detector, or fake information out there in the gaming community, so if you didn't make it a huge production, just to a few people and don't release the source, I am sure it would brighten the eyes of some true CS gamers, and keep the hackers puzzled. Remember, there isn't really any good aimbot detection out there, and it would be very nice to have a tool like that. *resorts to childish begging* ... well maybe not. Anyway... to understand exactly what is going on out there, and realize why gameplay is starting to falter, you must see what you are dealing with... OGC really has made gameplay everywhere undesirable. Also you should really consider what p1s19 mentioned about somewhat spawning fake entities, and from all the context I have seen on many developer sites, who better knows than botman?

think about it...

OGC is essentially a monster of a client side bot... Imagine your computer bots set to the worst settings, and the OGC users, if they wanted, they could be worse... Can you say 360 degree aimbot, thru walls, no reciol, speed hack, respawn hack, abitlity to see sounds...
 People think, computers don't... help stop the lameness

I've already made a proggy to observe human behaviors. It checks when people shoot other people through walls, too good aiming and in-human turns etc. It will also create a log file and has the ability to automatically kick players.

If you want the source just ask ;)

I dunno if it will work in 1.1.0.9 becuase of the getAuthId function, i havent updated the program since the new update.

oh btw it is specifically designed for counter-strike ;)

oh yes Cheesy, I completely forgot about your proggy, if I had reminded it I would have given the URL... very good idea btw :)

thanks :D

Actually I just noticed this a minute ago...

check out: http://csnation.counter-strike.net/

hurrah!

edit: lol... "Dropped beast from server" ;D

Oooh, I like the aimbot prog u made, I read up on the readme, but I haven't tested it yet... i would like it to where it started a kick vote for a player instead of kicking them automatically tho, if you wouldn't mind giving me the source, that would be great, I have a file hosting server, so if I fix it up, I will post it. Also this is kinda off topic, but kinda on topic... When I start up a dedicated server it goes to downloading the security module, and can't do it... so my server won't start up. I am behind a linksys router, which has a NAT firewall built in. I don't have a software firewall, and I can host just fine in listenserver.. hmmm   help?

Infos about how to configure firewalls for HLDS to work may be found in your HLDS readmes. Actually you need to do this :
QUOTE:

6) I am behind a firewall.  What ports need to be opened for hlds?
 
Incoming UDP to local destination 27015.
Outgoing UDP to remote destination 27010, 27012.
Outgoing TCP to remote destination 5273.
Outgoing TCP to remote destination 7002.

You can disable the auto-kicking feature in the program ;)

anyway Ive uplodaed the source here:

(The latest one with win32 DLL included and Ive fixed the stuff for HL 1.1.0.9)

thanks, you all are tha best. I think for the most part, valve has recently tackled the big cheats, so I will hold off on the anti-cheat stuff for my server, but I am keeping the copy of the aimbot detector on hand, for the future. Thanks, Like I said, I will post the edited version that I make, if I am happy with it.

just a little FYI - I rarely encounter cheaters, I could count them on one hand...

Me, on the other hand, I get accused of using an aimbot more often than not

In the new versions of Counter-Strike the para is dead accurate the first 2 shots, so I snipe with it... it's obvious the SOME people would say I am cheating, but not on THAT degree!

So I stopped for a few games and used nothing but shotguns... I got accused of cheating with that! How do you cheat with a shotgun? lol...

Anywho, this isn't to show off, but I'm just saying, that when you think someone is cheating, IMHO they probably aren't

See my first post on the thread, it describes methods I believe can tell reasonably accurately if a player is cheating or not.
We are not speaking about "humble opinions" here, we are dealing about facts. I don't think a good player always aims at the exact pev->origin + pev->view_ofs of his enemies, right ?
