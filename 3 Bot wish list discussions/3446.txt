I have a couple problems with your site. Basicually downloading problems with TFC levels for the HPB Bot.

I have a list of levels from your site that work and don't work. Maybe you can remove the non-working ones. Most of the non-working ones are giving me "Error: No info_player_start on level" messages.

Here's the list;

These are the current TFC maps for the HPB Bot I can download from WaypointWarehouse.com

just goto the http://www.clanakb.org/cgi-bin/maplist/maps.cgi and search for the map you want. I might update the links sometime but ive not updated the site for ages.
