This website wasn't set up as a Half-Life coding tutorial website.  There are already plenty of those (see my MOD FAQ).  Also it's fairly difficult and complicated to create bot tutorials where you can explain the concepts in a brief manner.  It's much easier just to look at the source code to see how things can be done.

Dont forget your readme.txt that pretty much sets you up.
