Anyone know where to get some good bots for the Judgement Mod of HL? I've been working on some waypoints for the HPB Bot and RealBot, but I'm short of time and have a LAN party coming up... We will add bots to teams as "handicaps" to make the teams more even and I hate to just have Cannon Fodder... Rather have some AI to them...

Any help or suggestions are appreciated... Just post here - I'll check each day... Thanks...
