TFC Wishes;

1. The bots dont always engage in combat, if out of ammo they run away and take cover to reload or get a new weapon out.

2. Have them use special skills! That would rule!

3. Make it so that they will recognize enemy sentry guns as enemies and have them attempt to take them out.

4. Make it so they dont recognize you as a spy

5. Make it so they talk or insult you once in a while


CS wishes;

1. Make it so the bots buy weapons depending on the map, ie. if its a closerange map like De_vegas they will most likely buy a shotgun instead of a sniper rifle

2. I dont care if they give radio commands, but I think it would be neat if they listened to your radio commands, ie. if you radio for backup the nearest bot to you will run up to help you.


Just my ten cents :)

Whoops, forgot to add one thing;

could you please make them compatible with Op4Ctf? All you would have to do is take the code for the TFC version and change the weapons basically.
