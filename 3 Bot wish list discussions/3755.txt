Subject: Monster Mod: adding other .mdl's?

Has anyone done any work on adapting Monster Mod to bring in monsters other than from the single player game?  Is this something that is even feasible?  I'd love to spawn a few skeletons from DSA into the dark corners of DOD for halloween... =>

You don't need the Monster plugin if you just want to spawn models.

Use my Stripper2 plugin to add models to maps.  Just use the "env_sprite" entity to spawn a model at a specific location...
code:
{
   classname/env_sprite
   PRECACHE_SPRITE(models/whatever.mdl)
   model/models/whatever.mdl
   origin/100 -350 1575
}


There's probably other entities that you can use as well just to spawn a model.

I think there is a monster_generic entity

Yes, you could use that.

You could also use "func_button" and about a dozen other entities if you just want to spawn a model.

Just for my knowledge of the thing, does the monster_generic use some sort of "generic" monster AI too ?

John, if you wanted the monster to have AI and attack the player, then yes, you would need to add that monster code to my Monster plugin for metamod.

Pierre-Marie, the monster_generic doesn't really have any AI.  They will be able to follow scripted sequences, but they won't attack the player.  So you can choose an animation for them and have them move around in a level, but they won't attack anything (and many of them won't even be solid).  See this tutorial for more info...

Yes, in the "dlls" folder.

You should be able to 'diff' the files in the Monster plugin 'dlls' folder and compare those to the files in the Half-Life SDK 'dlls' folder to see the things that I had to change (since you can't just copy the files from the SDK folder into the Monster plugin folder and expect them to work.

A very nice file comparison tool (ala diff) can be found here (it's called Beyond Compare)...

cool i got the comparison app goin
im rather new to this stuff but i'd like to ask what creating a new monster would entail.
from the looks of it i need to:
create a 3ds .max version of the model
create some animations with that model in max
code the ai and its attack stuff
i imagine valve or someone has some good tutorials on this... where should i look?

-thanks in advance :D

That depends on whether you want something just for private use, or you want something that other players can use.

All of the Monster code that I'm using uses the existing models in the Half-Life\valve\pak0.pak file (from the single player game).  All MODs have access to this pak0.pak file and all clients will already have these models on their machines.

If you create a custom model, then players will have to download that model to their client before they can connect to the server.  Many clients will have server downloads disabled to prevent the servers from putting crap on their client machines (so they wouldn't see the models you created).

If you want to create your own models for custom monsters, you will need a modeling tool.  You can use Milkshape (it's pretty inexpensive)...

http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/index.html

...they also have a nice (free) model viewer on their website that you can use to see the animations of models in the pak0.pak file.

There are some tutorials on the Milkshape website for creating models.  I suggest you also look at the Handy Vandal's website...

http://www.karljones.com/halflife/almanac.asp

...and the Valve ERC website...

http://www.valve-erc.com/

...which has quite a few good tutorials on mapping, modeling and coding.

These will have links to other websites that will help you with creating models or code for your monsters.

But the simplest thing to do is just port the existing monster code from the Half-Life SDK over to the Monster plugin and use the existing models.  That way you get familiar with the code without having to learn how to model or create animations or skins for the model.
