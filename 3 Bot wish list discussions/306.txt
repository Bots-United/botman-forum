ok the question for this is in the thread "Wish #1". I don't know if you read this but here is my idea for the problem of bots using crowbars at close range. 


well it just matters, can you make the bots have personalities??? some use guns and some use crowbars??? or atleast make a command for the config file like( bot_closecro "then a percentage" then bot_closewep "then another percentage" but both percentages added together have to equal 100%. if done right then X% amout of bots would use crowbar at close ranger and Y% amout of bots would use weapons at close range.

Why don't you just get rid of the crowbars completely? A bot is supposed to be the closest thing to playing a human being by yourself. If you play TFC online you'll see that no one uses the crowbar unless they are bored or they sneak up behind someone else.

Please read some of the other threads about aiming, weapon usage, and crowbars.

There is a "Search" function at the top of the forum to make this easier.

Crowbar and umbrella fights on hunted is always good fun!
Maybe thats an idea, just pure crowbars as a weapon option!
