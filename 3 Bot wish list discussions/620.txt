hehe, by putting that subject i bet i got lots of people to look at this thread. Hey botdude, i've tried like 5 other TFC bots that i found (took me tons of time just to find them) and by far yours is the best so far. Keep working on it as much as possibal because others arn't that far behind.

One quick comment, GET THAT LADDER THING TO WORK, please, in crossover2 all of my teamates get stuck in the ladder then they just get killed by the other team, then they go back and get killed again, pi*ses me off man!
