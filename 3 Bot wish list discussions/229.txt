I can get the bots to capture the first point ... you just tell them that their flag is the enemy flag and the capture point is well ... the capture point .. but when it gets to round 2 they will get confused as there will be 2 capture points on the map ... 

perhaps (not now but later in development) different waypoint file. could be loaded as the map progresses. This would be the only way the bots could work on dustbowl effectivly. Eg: when CP 1 is captured it would have to load file dustbowl2.wpt or something. Is it possible ... if need be the client (host) the person who is playing would have to load it by theirself.
