Wasteland is a damn fun mod, imho, but it needs some bots, as a lot of servers are filled with jerks and such (everyone knows that).  i just think this would be a most excellent idea.

I agree with dat, WHL begs for bots. The most excellent for offliners.

Yes, that's a great idea !

Vote for this bot on the Multi Launcher Bot website > POLL !

It could be very pretty for players like me using AOL and it's 5000-all-the-day-ping ! :-)

Keep the spirit and good frags !
