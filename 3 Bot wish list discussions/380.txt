Would it be possible to make a kind of mod, where 10 Bots and normal player play together or would the lag be too great?

That already exists.  Download the HPB bot or any of the bots shown on the "Links" page on my website to do this.

You can create a server, add bots, and have any number of real human players join the game (well, up to 31 other players/bots + yourself).
