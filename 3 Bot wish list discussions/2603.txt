is there any idea for implementing a waypoint which can attach to the elevator....? the particular waypoint will always follow the object

You could do this if you wanted to but it would be quite a bit of work.

The func_door (elevator) stores the direction and movement speed in the edict fields (see the Spawn function in the doors.cpp file for details).

You would probably have to create a "waypoint entity" that had the same speed and direction that doors had (along with the same Blocked function to stop/change the door when blocked by something).  This would allow the waypoint entity to mirror the position of the door.
