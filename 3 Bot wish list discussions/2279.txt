Now, first I want to say i might have no clue what i'm talking about here, and I'm sorry if i am. I personally own several low end machines, all below 500 mhz, all runnning the Distributed.net client. Now individually, these systems definatly arn't much, but together they have a decent ammount of power. With the HPB bot on my main machine I can run about 10 bots with ease. My idea is allow the Bots to be controled from other computers. All my computers are networked, Why can't the shitty compaq take a few off of me and control them, same with the PII under the bed. If I could send a few of these bots away and then have seperate clients connecct to the HPB bot on this net wouldn't this in theory allow me to run more except Distributed around?

P.S. Nice to see you in the news group BotMan, Stay around, it's nice to have a new person who isn't a troll

Someone could create a Windows sockets interface between the Half-Life server and several other standalone machines to allow each PC to control one or more bots then send the desired movement and combat commands to the Half-Life server so that it could update the bot's position, viewing direction, weapon selection, etc.

I suspect that there are VERY few people with your situation that have a slow server and some even slower standalone machines.  Because there aren't very many people with a set up like this a developer would have to spend a whole lot of effort developing something that only a very few people would actually use.

You might do better to try to sell the other machines that you have, take all of the combined money from the sale of the old machines and buy a faster machine to allow you to run more bots.

Also note that some bots are more CPU efficient than other bots.  Some have very complex navigation/combat routines that require lots of CPU power while others have very simple navigation/combat routines that don't require much CPU power at all.  Try using other bots that are available for the MODs that you like to play to see whether you can run more or less bots than what you had been using.  The more CPU efficient bots might not be as challenging as the CPU intensive bots, but if your goal is to have more players, and not better players, this might be acceptable to you.

I was wondering if something like this could be doen, like a dedicated CLIENT server :) Tell me if it already can :)) Then the clients server/modem would do all the work and your one will connect to it and should be faster in a way. I dunno. :)
