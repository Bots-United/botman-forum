Yes, I could, but should I really have to?

Since I am the administrator, I can also reset your post count back to zero.  Spamming the forum really doesn't accomplish anything except giving your mouse clicking finger some exercise anyway.  If you want to exercise your mouse clicking finger you should start up a game of Half-Life and kill some bots instead.

YaBB has a special account called "admin" that can modify stuff on the board.  I only log in to the admin account when I want to remove a thread or clean something up.  The username assigned to the admin account is "botman".  Which is the same as the username assigned to my botman account.  I don't normally post using the admin account.

Yeh botman, what`s up with the stars. We really didn`t want that you remove the star system with our little star wars (:-)) I hope you are going to change it back

Sorry, you'll have to settle for a "Posts:" count.

If people start abusing that then I'll remove it as well.

Why doesn't anyone seem to be talking about bots?
I don't particularly like little children either.
Or asians. But before you say im rascist, keep in mind that i am asian. I just dont like us, OK?

I think everything about bots has been talked about. Well until next release anyways :)

*maybe botman should make another board for the children. Be alot more fun than hanging around someone like Bob. Could call it "Absolutely Nothing to do with Bots" discussions

"maybe botman should make another board for the children."

I have actually considered that.  You can post whatever crap you want and you will get a star for every single post you make (up to the first 100 anyway).

I could call it "botman's whiner's forum", where all the little whiners and cry babies can go and flame the hell out of each other.

I think I'll do that!
