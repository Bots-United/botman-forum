I've received much e-mail lately from people wanting to know if I'll do a bot for Day of Defeat or Firearms or Action Half-Life.  I have mentioned before that I will only add bot support to MODs that I like to play.  If a MOD has been out for more than a few weeks and I haven't announced that I will be adding bot support to it, then chances are that I won't create a bot for that MOD.  I'm sorry if this makes you angry, but I just don't have the time to create a bot for every single MOD that's out there.  That's why I released my bot source code, so that other developers can create bots for MODs that I'm not going to support.

I've tried it myself, and I know someone else has and there is a problem, the bots don't move very well. I gave up since I was just testing if I also got the problem with my bot.. and I did.

If I remember correctly everytime RunPlayerMove was called their ideal move speed was about 300 or whatever..I could try I again but I uninstalled etc :s
