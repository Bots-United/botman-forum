First let me say Beta 3.0 is great as I have limited internet access and love TFC :)

Some HUGE difference between humans and bots that may or may not be possible to correct:
1: Bots using crowbar. Lol.
2: Bots charging helter-skelter at enemies (Humans are cowards and like to TRY to dodge incoming fire)
3: Bots using nailgun/Supernailgun. It just don't happen against humans because humans cant hit each other with those guns (LAG LAG LAG LAG!!)
4: Bots shooting pipes/rockets full on and at close range. Make em aim at the feet with rockets and back back to use pipes if the enemy gets close enough
5: Anti-Spam bots? Tell em to throw grens, and then not walk into em!

This is most likely the 1,000,000,000th time these are up, and some are probably impossible to code (Hence the name WISH LIST!!!!)

Keep up the good work!
