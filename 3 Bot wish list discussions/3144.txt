There is a new mod that is still in beta which is looking to be a great one.  It is called Tour of Duty - www.tourofdutymod.com - and is set in the Vietnam War.  There have been many people on the ToD forums that would like a bot.  If you are interested, could you make one botman?  I think you would have to sort it out with the team.

It's not exactly a new MOD.  It's been around for quite a while.

No, I won't be adding support for ToD to the HPB bot.

Hmm, i can't open the Website. Perhaps you should ask the person who creates the <a href="http://www.nuclearbox.com"><b> Akimbot</b></a>. Perhaps he adds a support.
