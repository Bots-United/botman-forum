When I installed HPB 2.1 it installed a tfc bot dll file, a normal half life dll file, a Counter-Strike dll file and a opfor dll file, but when I downloaded the HPB 2.1 source code it only gives you the source code of the HPB.dll file. Any chance of the TFC, CS, OPFOR source codes???

The HPB_bot.dll (found in the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder) is used for Half-Life, TFC, CS and OpFor.  There is only 1 version of this file and it is updated everytime I make a new release.

If you've already got the HPB bot installed you will have to browse into the HPB_bot folder then into the MOD folder below the HPB_bot folder and run the "Remove" batch file, then run the "Install" batch file.  This will upgrade you to the latest version.

The HPB bot template source code contains everything you need to create a bot for Half-Life, TFC, CS or OpFor.  There isn't (and never was) HPB bot source code specific to any particular MOD.
