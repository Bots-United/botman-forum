ok heres a little list of suggestions and things that are kinda bugs in version 1.2 of hpb_bot.

1) Engineers keep trying to repair teammates armor even when they are out of cells (a simple iAmmo/Clip or whatever check is needed)

2) maybe engineers should only hit the teammates twice and then go away as they always seem preoccupied trying to hit their teamamte with its spanner!

3) If there is non passable func_wall, func_door, etc blocking the view between a bot and enemy, the bot should ignore the enemy!

4) Allow medics to give teammates more than 100% Health.

5) Bot skill should be altered a bit more. Newbie bots (Like skill 5) should stand still while shooting, where as a bot with skill 1 will jump and run around a lot while shooting.

SKILLS all classes except hwguy (See below)--- while shooting
-------------------------

skill 1) Jumps, Runs and strafes
skill 2) Runs and strafes less with slightly less accuracy
skill 3) Runs and strafes only while shooting
skill 4) Runs backward/Forward while shooting
skill 5) Stands still while shooting

HWGUYS while shooting with Cannon
------------------------------------

skill 1) Jumps and strafes about while shooting
skill 2) Jumps about while shooting
skill 3-4) Crouchs and jumps while shooting
skill 5) Crouches while shooting

Also maybe have it so that a bot will upgrade sentries if he sees one, not only his own.  Also how hard would it be to have a bot blow a dispenser if an enemy is near it?

Cheesemoster: Full ack :)
Additionaly: if bots have a primed gren in the hand, they should throw it away, also if the enemy is no longer in it's view.
- maybe it's possible, that bots first try to push
a button and secondary shoot at it...(like in well, shutdown1&2 etc.) also, if the button is not reachable from their position (like in engoff)
- Scouts fights too much :) they should go for the flag / for the cap, but don't fight with hwg's or other characters :) ok, one or two shoots, when they passing by, but that's enough :)
they should throw calltrops only on the caprun.

Can you eventually add a system like waypoints, which the bots NEVER will cross? (Avoiding the water in 2fort for example)
- rocketjump for soldiers (seems easy :) )
- faster sg placement and upgrading
  teammates should throw unneeded ammo near sg's
- general improvement of ladder climbing
  (sidestep to leave a ladder etc.)

OMG! it's a lot more than I would write...:)
But I think, you wellcome improvements :)

Oh yeah that was another thing I forgot to mention...

Finding enemies through waypoint paths instead of running straight at them, cos thats what make them fall into water and off ledges etc!

1. Yes, I agree.  I left that part out when I added it.

2. Yes, right now they always make 3 whacks (if you are moving they miss you on one or two of them).  I'll change it so they check how much armor you have and stop whacking you when you have enough.

3. I'm not really sure how to do this easily.

4. Yes, there used to be (still is?) a bug where they wouldn't leave you alone when healing you and you'd go up to 150% or more.  I reworked some stuff so that they are supposed to stop at 100.  Maybe I'll change it so that they will sometimes heal you more than 100%.

5. I'm not too sure about this one.  When I was a newbie (just a few weeks ago!) I didn't stop running when chasing after somebody and firing at them (at least not with most weapons).  I think that BETTER players would actually stand still with certain weapons (sniper type weapons) to get better aim.  One of my friends will almost always crouch and fire to get better aim even in MODs where standing vs. crouching doesn't effect the accuracy.

I have also considered getting the bots to aim at enemies and side strafe following waypoints to get toward and enemy.  This makes sense in maps like 2FORT, but I'm not sure how it would effect some of the other maps.  It might look pretty weird but I'll plan on testing this in a future release of the HPB bot.  I'll probably allow the user to enable or disable this feature.  If you don't like it you can turn it off.
