Hi i want to make a mod called The Simpsons its gonna be a single player and multiplayer. I was thinking for the singleplayer to play with Bart and he has missions and in the multiplayer i was thing about having Springfield Charecters VS Shallbefield (Im not sure if thats the Real name but i mean the town beside them).Also the multiplayer is gonna have Capture the Flag,DeathMatch and some of ur ideas.

We need a lot of experienced good mappers,and model makin people,we also need very experienced coders,we also need a sounds people and good animators, we also need a webmaster to create the site.

Here is a short list of jobs:Mappers, Coders, GFX artists, Model Animators, Model Skinners, Player Modelers, Sound Technicians, Texture Artists, Weapon Modellers, Weapon Animators, Weapon Animators, Weapon Skinners, and Webmasters.

FOX will NOT let you create a MOD with a Simpsons theme.

FOX has already shut down 3 different MODs that tried to make a MOD based on the Simpsons.  FOX is VERY protective of their copyrights and you will only spend time making a MOD that will get shut down as soon as they find out about it.
