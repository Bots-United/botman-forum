hiho .. first of all: hpb_bot is good stuff . thx botman :)

now my feature requests:

1) offset_clients
would it be possible to have a new value offset_clients so min_bots, max_bots can specified relative to the number of clients on the server?

i would like to have one bot permanently on the server who should leave if there are more than a certain number of real players on the server (im thinking of 3-4 real players).

more generally it would b kewl to have an offset_clients number. if set to 0 then min_clients, max_clients work as they do now. if set to eg 4 then first bot get kicked when the 5th player joins. that should be easy to implement and would help a lot i think.

2) ping humanizer
would it be possible to implement some ping range variables so bots dont have that ping 5 all the time? im thinking of ping_min and ping_max. bots pings would then - if randomly choosen - look more realistic :)

3) connect time / scores / frag and timelimits
running config with min_bots and max_bots is quite strange. had players connecting to the server so the bots got kicked, when coming back they have their old score and connection time which is quite confusing for players who have disconnected and then have a look at the stats (eg gametiger.net). so it would b great if there were variables like bot_frags_min and bot_frags_max so the bots disconnect if they got a (randomly choosen) number of frags between bot_frags_min and bot_frags_max. also a bot_time_max number would be nice. after a bot got kicked a bot with a different name, reseted connection time and reseted score should join the game. dont know if that is possible at all?!

Why do i need all this? I m using HPB_bot since ppl wont join an empty server. As soon as someone stays for at least 10 minutes other ppl follow and the server gets filled. ppl realizing they r alone will leave immediatly. MANY ppl realizing they r playing against a bot too. so i would like to hide the bot from being realized as a bot for at least 15 minutes, so ppl stay long enough and the server gets a change to get filled. as soon as the number of real clients rises i dont want any bot on the server at all.

thx in advance,
  doggy

I'm not making any more updates to the HPB bot (except to make it work properly with future Valve client updates).

The answers to your questions are:

1) Sure this would be possible, but I doubt many people would want to operate the server this way.

2) Can't be done.  The engine hard codes the ping at 5 msec for fake clients.

3) This is a known problem with the HPB bot.  I believe other bots handle this scorce resetting problem correctly.  Take a look at my "Links" page for the URLs to other bots sites and try them out to see (or contact the author of the bot and ask them).
