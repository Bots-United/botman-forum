For the possible release this weekend ( Sunday on May 20th.), could you maybe look into tweaking these:

1) Grenades, when the bots throw the grenades not All the time will they release them & they end up killing themself.

2) Possible maybe to get spy to disguise?

3) Engineer, Pleeeeezzz add some type of switch or something so that the engineer will not constantly try and give metal when he has none to give.

The spy really dosen't matter much, but if you could look into the other 2 that would be Great!
Question, Did you ever tweek the sniper so that if your on the opposing team the enemy sniper would be the more potent one? Kinda seems that why, cuz i played about 2 hours on each team and it seemed if the opposing sniper was always the stronger. LOL, i've been playing the Heck outa 2fort 90mins +Plus and the bots have been suprising the heck outa me. It's as if at times they become human like ( Smart ).. LOL!! Ohhh, i just switched back to the New Models & it seems as if they play even Better.. Dam it's Fun\Funny playin with the HPB.. ;D :) ;)

ps, The soldiers play Great with the feet aiming, I Love playin agianst them!

Oh also to add, Do you think you could add maybe a bot_taunt.txt ?

1) I haven't seen them do this, but I'll look into it.  There used to be (still is?) a bug where the bots would spawn and think they still need to throw the grenade.  I changed some grenade code but don't know if that took care of that problem or not (it didn't hurt anything, it just looked weird).

2) Not by this weekend, but maybe someday (I'm not a big spy fan so I don't really consider this a high priority).

3) Yep, that should be easy to fix.  I'll also make the engineer's tendency to upgrade other people armor configurable.  It's kinda annoying seeing them always wacking on their teammates (especially since you almost NEVER see it happen on a Internet server).

4) The snipers don't take into account which team they are on.  But MORE bots one team than on the other will make the other team's bots stronger due to TFC's team balancing crap (i.e. fewer members on your team give you more damage).

5) I can probably add the bot taunting stuff too since I've already got most of the code that reads the text files, and sends the messages when a kill happens.

About Point 3 
I always play Def and espically on FF servers you must NEVER try and help out your teamates.
Most of the people I find on the net dont realise that Engies can repair your armour so they blast the hell out of you !
