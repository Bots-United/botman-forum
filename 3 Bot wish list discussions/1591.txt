1)I waypointed Villa, holding out some hope that maybe i would be able to get it working half right, but nope. As soon as i label one of the 5 capture points in the map and the bots take the flags there, & they'll just hang around forever. And it's a large map, so when all three flag carries make it to their destination they just hang around. I tried doing the tags differently but as soon as i remove "Flag Goal Location" they just become really clueless and don't really go anywhere.

2)Need water support ( Like they used to have ). Their backstroke & doggypaddel are not working. I tried pathwaypoint create1 - pathwaypoint create2 but they just seem to be confused and don't go to the next waypoint. I've even tried putting them closer together but still no go. They just frantically turn from left to right, Sometimes they'll make a couple but then they become disoriented agian and usually be then it's to late and they drown. ( I'm going to keep trying it, cuz they used to be really good swimmers )!

I know that the water problem was bought up once before & i think that you said you had no problems, but that kinda ended that discussion. So i'm really not sure, and i do know my bots won't swim. But they used to be Excellent swimmers. 

I'm very patient & if you think the water really isn't a problem then i'll have to live with that i guess even though i don't want to. 
If the problem is just me, then what's a possible suggestion i could do to try and make them better swimmers?

It's been a long time since I've gone and looked at the water navigation code.  The water navigation code hasn't changed any since the Beta 1.0 release (when I added water navigation) but it's possible that I messed up something in the water navigation when I added other stuff.

I keep trying to find a good Half-Life or TFC map with LOTS of water in it so that I can try some waypoint navigation stuff under water without the bots always trying to attack each other.

Here's something you can try.  Pull down the console and use the "botdontshoot 1" to prevent the bots from attacking each other and see if the water navigation behaves any differently.  There's always an outside chance that Valve changed something to do with water in the 1.1.0.5 or 1.1.0.6 release of Half-Life (and TFC).

I'll go back and look at the water navigation stuff again this weekend (if I can find some maps with water in it besides 2FORT).

I can make you one to test with if you like, what do you want the basic layout to be?  I could make it one big pool, or maybe some underwater tunnels.  Just tell me what you want.  I think that the water navigation has gone awry somewhere, hopefully you can figure it out.  But yeah, tell me how you want the map and i will whip it together.

The only map that i can think of with alot of water would be monkey_l.bsp .. Which could be found at planetfortress.com/complex/PlanetFortress TF Map Complex ( In, New 100 Reviews ). But sounds like [Pizza]Monkey Boy could do Much Better.. Gurgle .. Gurgle .. ;D

Oh, i'm not on the right puter, but in a few i will be & i'll try what you had suggested.. :)

Ah Ha! Here's what i did,
I redid the water in 2fort that comes with the Current Version of the HPB_bot. What i did was use "pathwaypoint remove1" - "pathwaypoint remove2" and removed the path through the tunnels so that the bots would Not turn around and keep pressing forward! I also put above each tunnel a Team Specfic marker so that the appropriate team would go down the enimies tunnel. My bot_strafe_percent was at 8, while i tested to see how the bots would do. They Will go down AND make it to the enimies base and go up the stairs and suprise the enemy team! I'd say there's about a 70-80 percent chance that they will make it and not drown. I was paying close attention and possible cause's for them to drown are,

1) When in water, they sometimes end up in a corner doing battle with the enemy and don't go up for air, so they see the maker above the tunnel which is underwater and they go down while gasping for air already.

2) They are still a little hesitent in following the waypoints (maybe because of the strafe?) which then could cause drowning.

That's really about it. I'm defiently More Happy with their swimming in 2fort now! IMHO - Big Improvement. But when you look at the code and can possibly tweak it, "I think were going to have some Gold Medalist swimmers on our hands"! hehe .. ;) I played a regular game with 14 bots, 7 on each team and i left bot shootin on.
===========================
Ok, so i also did monkey, but just engough to see how they would make for a swim Half around the Lake and head downwards towards the red's Looooong tunnel (which has an air pocket in which you MUST go up for air or drown) and i gotta tell ya, i put 3 Blue classes in to see how they'd do. (I did the waypoints same as 2fort).. First they do a beautiful cannonball into the lake useing the new "Jump waypoint". From there they swim a U and proceed to go down into the water and head through the tunnel. Then they come to the first air pocket which they head up to and take a nice breather and then proceed down the rest of the tunnel (for some reason they don't use the second air pocket, but dosen't matter cuz it's only a short stretch from there which they Do accomplish)! Then it's up the ladder, over the bridge and a nice Jump right up to the flag!
So if you want to take a look at it, i've included it in the zip. I only did 1 respawn so hopefully they'll respawn in the correct room for you. Shouldn't be much of a problem since there are only 2 spawns. And i tried it with 3 Blue bots at one time. Same as above with bot_strafe_percent 8 .. I think i'm going to try to waypoint monkey fully with water support for both teams and see how it comes out. :)

Straffing may be what's causing the problem (but I believe the water navigation wasn't working properly before straffing was added).

You can try setting the bot_strafe_percent to 0 before creating the bots and see if underwater navigation improves.  Maybe I just need to disable straffing while underwater???

I think putting bot_strafe_percent 0 helps a little, but there still touchy.. I was watching & some classes just zipped right through, like Medic & Scout.
