Botman,
Any chance you could add weapon buying code for CounterStrike to the next version of your bot?  If not do you know of any CS bots that do? 
Thanks,
Juhika Bloth

I won't be adding weapon buying code to the Counter-Strike part of the HPB bot and I'm not aware of any of the CS bots that work under Linux.

I'm not sure why none of the CS bot authors won't create a Linux version of their bots.  It's really not that hard to do.  99% of the code is exactly the same as the Win32 version.

AFAIK, there are 2 CS Bots available for Linux:
SwatBot and BobaBot

POD-Bot will be ported over to Linux after my V2.0 Release...

I just modified your code to support buying weapons, I really didn't want to get into writing my own bot but I thought it was probably the best way to get the features I want.  Now I need to decided if I want to do any more work on it.  I just got done doing a research paper on parallizing all pairs shortest path problems and might apply some to "my" bot.  I havn't had a chance to see what kind of algorithm you guys are using for way points?  I remember someone saying something about Floyd...I'm interested in seeing what will work well here.

"My" implementation of the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is included in the waypoint.cpp file in the HPB bot template source code.

I put quotes around "My" because I actually stole the code from here...

http://home.wxs.nl/~faase009/HaFloyds.html

...and modified it slightly.

There are functions in the waypoint.cpp file that use the Floyd's table to get next waypoint in a path given the current waypoint and the goal waypoint.

What did you wind up with as the time complexity (big O) for your parallel all pairs shortest path algorithm?  Something better than O(N^3) I hope!
