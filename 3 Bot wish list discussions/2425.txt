I've also started working on a new project that doesn't have anything that can
be released yet.  The new project will be a set of tools to use with BSP
files.  The tools will include a BSP utility that will aid <font color="Red">bot developers</font>???
in automatically waypointing a map file.



That's from your post on September 29th, 2001.
Now i read more that your really comeing along pretty good and possible release comeing. 

1) But is this tool of no use to me since i'm not a developer?

2) And if it's only for the developers, aren't there email boxes going to overflow with request's from people wanting them to make waypoints for maps?

The main use of it is to make waypoints specificly for your own bot (me thinks) I think once botman has made it anyway then no need to spend a lot of time making waypoints for the HPB_Bot.

The automatic waypoint editor can still be used by anybody that wants to download it.  I also wanted to provide source code that will allow other bot developers to automatically create waypoints for MODs other than what the HPB supports.

The initial waypoint generator will only support Half-Life deathmatch.  It will know about the weapons "weapon_shotgun", "weapon_crossbow", "weapon_snark", etc. and will know about ammo "ammo_rpg", "ammo_sniper", etc. and about healthkits "item_healthkit", and about the deathmatch spawn points, but it won't handle doors, ladders, buttons, lifts, water, etc.

You can use the waypoint generator to create waypoint files for any Half-Life deathmatch map that you want, but the waypoint files WON'T be very good.  If you can imagine blind man creating a waypoint file for a level, that's kind of what they will look like.  The waypoints are fairly evenly spaced, but don't follow any kind of path at the moment.  There's also nothing currently in the waypoint generator that generates paths between the waypoints.  Most of these things will be added later as time goes by.  I just wanted to get some beta versions of the applications out there so that other people could begin to make use of the code that I currently have.

The waypoint files might not be great, but in some cases they might be a hell of a lot better than not having any waypoint file at all.  You'll have to try it for yourself and see.

My intent wasn't to distribute a utility that didn't actually do anything, but it will be several more weeks (or months) before the waypoint generator will be able to create something comparable to what a human could generate.  Most maps will still require some "fine tuning" of the automatically generated waypoint files no matter how good the utility becomes.

Ahhhh. Your Great botman! Always releaseing your source so others can build off of it. Cool, well even if they may not be the greatest i'll have something to look forward to playing around with! ;D And i've got plenty of Great HLDM maps to mess around with! hehe .. Good, cuz Parabot frags me to much! But with HPB i can enjoy my life a little longer. :D
