I cant go by without my daily fix of client commands.

First off, here are some ideas for some specific waypoints;

defensive waypoint- it would actually be two waypoints. The bot could pace slowly back and forth through both waypoints on gaurd untill it sees an enemy. Good for defending flag rooms in maps like "The well".

Detpack waypoint- for demoman. This would signal to the bot that they should place a detpack at that location.

Special jump waypoint- it would tell the bot (depending on the class) that they have to perform a conc jump or a rocket jump to get to that waypoint.

SG waypoint- for engineers. This will tell any engineers that it would be a good idea to build a sentry gun at that waypoint.

Escape waypoint- for civilians. It would be great for maps like "The hunted". It would simply tell the civilian that it should do whatever it can to get to that waypoint which would be placed in the escape zone.


And now for bot chat;

I know most people didnt like the Q3 bots but I always thought it was so cool that if you say something to the bot like "my dog can do better than you" the bot would respond "wow, thats quite a dog" or something like that.

So, generate a text file. The user could type a phrase in the text file that a player could possible say during a game. Then they also write what the bot will respond back if it sees that message typed. 
I think that would work.



Map specfic-

For this you would probbably have to make a new TFC FGD file.
It would be an entity that you place in the map.
It would tell what classes would be better used, for instance in a long range map u would place an entity that would say that it would be a good idea to be a sniper rather than a scout :P




Just some ideas, Id do it my self but C++ is way over my head.

Cool ideas. especially the defense and the sg ones. Also a camp specific waypoint would be cool. so you could put one down for like an hw and he would stand there till he dies.
