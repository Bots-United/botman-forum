No, everything you need is included in the HPB bot template source code zip file (except for a C++ compiler).  You can use MingW32, the free Borland C++ command line compiler (which I would recommend instead of MingW32 since it's faster) or the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

The Standard SDK will be a valuable resource to help you understand how things in the game operate.  You can look at the code for things like ladders, doors, windows (func_breakable), water, weapons, etc.  It will help you understand how Counter-Strike handles these things inside the MOD DLL code.
