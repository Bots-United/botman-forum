Okay this isn't really about bots, more about Botmixer5000. It would be sweet if instead of running different bots at once, Botmixer could merge them together and create one bot, using points that you pick from a menu. E.g. PODbots movement and radio commands, HPB_Bots teamplay, Realbots menu, etc...
I'm no programmer...but most of the bots out today seem to use your original source code, Botman, would that make it possible to do? If it would I presume it would be hard, and take a long time :) *sighs* Oh well, I'll keep dreaming ;)

Can't be done unless the bot developers are willing to release the bot source code.

You can't pick and choose functions from executables and merge them together into another executable.

You'll have to settle for being able to run several different types of bots at the same time.

Oh, and of course the different types of bots won't "work together" or communicate with each other or anything like that.  From each individual bots perspective another type of bot is just another player.  If a bot will typically follow a player around without any intervention from the player, then that same bot would be likely to follow another bot around (but only if this happened automatically and you didn't have to send a command to get bot to get it to do this).
