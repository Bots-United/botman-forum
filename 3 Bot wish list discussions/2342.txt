Metamod is the answer to more than one bot or "mod to a mod" working at the same time.

Will already played with HTPbot a little bit, but that was in April. It would be cool if this could be made to work in metamod.

Part of the problem with Metamod is that it restricts what functions the bots can get at (for example, it doesn't let the bot code touch ANYTHING inside the MOD's DLL code).

Also with Metamod it's impossible for a bot DLL to know if other bot DLLs are running at the same time.  Any bot DLL code that assumes that all players with the FAKECLIENT bit set is a bot will have problems with this.  They will try to manipulate bots that are actually "owned" by other bot code.  The BotMixer5000 code gets around this problem by temporarily turning off the FAKECLIENT bit on bots that are not owned by one of the bot DLLs.
