I have been useing the Monster Mod Addon since it's 3.0 release as an Addon to be used during fun mode which was only no Fridays on our Counter-Strike server.

However, The [FOX] Clan started to transfer over to it's 10th straight game, Ever Quest just recently. The server came down as the clan transfered.

I now play Counter-Strike as a get away game, however something struck me last week that made me put my server back online. It was the simple reason that not only were there zero dedicated monster servers in Counter-Strike, but nobody that had ever entered my server had ever heard about it. This has made me spend well over 24 hours of work to get my server back up and running with about 7 maps with monster spawn points in them.

I shall now bring the excitement to csnation which is the home for all News, Skins, Mods, ect. for Counter-Strike.

Please check out my server at IP: server.foxclan.com
Console: /connect server.foxclan.com

I will post some of my ideas later on this board, thanks for the monster modification plugin, it has made CS worth playing for a bit.
