I think that for a bot maker that this mod www.natural-selection.org would be a great mod to make bots for it seems as if it would be a challenge to do.

So has anyone thought of making bots for it when it is released which should be soon since they are feature complete and finalizing the tests to make sure it is balanced and unbuggy.

I can't it but I can say to all bot developers:
This will become a very good mod:
So i grab http://www.natural-selection.de.vu and I'm going to do my own page for it. Plz support this mod.
