is it possible to put a botskill and/or class after a name in the bot_names.txt file in a later realease becuase it would be better or a bot with a specific name given a specific class or skill etc. this is done in the fabled jumbot !!! :)

i think thats a good idea.


i think the jumbot sucks big time. especially if you have costom models the bots never use them.. and changing the skills doesn't do anything.

You could just use the name and skill level in the addbot command like so (assuming TFC bot.cfg)...

addbot 3 2 Bubba 1

Yeah, like botman said.
I put mine in the mapname.cfg and it works fine example....

addbot 2 6 [Pizza]Officer_Doofy


And Zach Jumbot will use the custom models you just have to make sure that you have the models in your jumbot\models\player folder and make sure the names of the bots match their folders. The way i did it was by changing the large_bots config
to bot models and names that i wanted.  Here is a sample of how i did mine......

Also here is an example of my jumbot.cfg, make sure you have bot_random set to 1  and set bot_skill to 0 so that the bots will use the skill values that you set in the large_bot.cfg

//This file is executed each time the Jumbot gets started up.
//Note that you can change any of these values freely and also
//add values to the file (such as botaccuracy, botfov, etc).

//NOTE: Editing these values (other than bot_num) may cause problems, because
//not all combinations have been tested. Editing this file is done at your own
//risk.

bot_random 1 //Set to 1 to make bots added be completely random.

bot_num 8 //Sets default number of bots to start with.

bot_snipers 1 //Enables bot snipers.

bot_campers 1 //Enables bot campers.

bot_realgame 1 //Sets realistic server game to disabled by default.

bot_objavoid 1 //Enables "intelligent" avoidance of grenades, satchels, etc.

bot_longjump 1 //Bots will use the longjump module (if they have it) to get
               //places faster in standard navigation if this is 1.

bot_gauss 1 //Bots can gauss jump to get to high-up areas if set to 1.

bot_weaprun 10 //Bot runs if weapon's points are less than this value.

bot_keepsettings 1 //If this is 1, bots keep their own accuracy, FOV, etc.
                   //settings from the time they are added. You can have bots
                   //with different difficulty settings in the same game this
                   //way, though you won't be able to change the settings in
                   //real-time for the bots that are added while this is set
                   //to 1.

bot_skill 0 //0 uses the botaccuracy, botfov, etc. cvars. 1 is easy, 2 is
            //medium, 3 is hard, and 4 is very hard.

botcfgfile large_bots.cfg //Sets default name of file to read bot info from.

chatfile exchat.cfg //Sets default name of file to read chat info from.

botchat 1 //Sets if bot chatting should be enabled from the start (0=off, 1=on).

bot_distance 2054 //Sets the maximum distance the bot can see an enemy at.
bot_checkdistance 1 //Set to 0 to allow the bot to see any distance.

bot_tripmines 1 //Bots can place tripmines if set to 1.
bot_turret 1 //Bots can use turrets.

bot_rpgaimlow 1 //Set to 0 to tell bots not to aim at feet with the RPG.

bot_runaway 1 //Setting to 1 allows the bot to attempt to run away if its
              //losing in combat.

bot_hunt 1 //Allows the bot to hunt and track down enemies by hearing them
           //at other spots in the level.

bot_crowbar 0 //Set to 1 to start off in crowbar mode.

speedup 0 //Slower computers should have this set to 1 or 2.

botmsec 0 //Sets speed of bots.

msecdiv 800 //Sets division value for calculating the msec value.

msec_min 10 //Sets msec auto-adjust's minimum value to 10.

msec_max 75 //Sets msec auto-adjust's maximum value to 75.

bot_thinkspeed 0.1 //Setting to 1 will give bots slower reaction time, but also
                   //take a very heavy lift off of the processor.

bot_angleupdate 1 //Keeps the bot's angles updated every frame no matter what
                  //bot_thinkspeed is. Set to 0 to disable.

bot_viewdelay 0.5 //Bots won't react instantly to things if this is set to non-zero.

bot_yawspeed 25 //Speed at which the bot turns.

waypoints 1 //Set to 0 to disable the bot's use of waypoints. The advantage to
            //this is that you will get a good performance boost and you won't
            //need to use JRF files. However, the bot's level navigation will
            //be quite crippled.
nav_autogen 1 //Auto-generates the bot's navigational system information if
              //the use of waypoints is turned off. Not quite as good as
              //using pre-set waypoints, but very good for an "on-the-fly"
              //navigation system.

wp_autoplace 0 //Sets waypoint placement to manual if a level isn't waypointed.
wp_jumpplace 0 //1 makes it so a jump waypoint is placed each time you jump if the
               //level isn't waypointed.

echo "The jumbot.cfg file has been executed."
echo "Set bot_num to higher or lower values to change the number of bots."
echo "See your jumbot.cfg file for more options."

For TFC I Think the HPB Bot is going to be the best ever.  As for half life deathmatch, everyone knows that the jumbot rules all.  Anyone ever play sci-hunt?

but I'd really like the bot to add a random named bot but that bot has specific skill settings etc just by binding a key to "addbot" or something :)
