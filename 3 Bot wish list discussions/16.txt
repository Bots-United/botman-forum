I am hoping that someday I can be playing TFC with bots that act close to human behavior. I am also hoping that they can have a command thing, so I could press \ for example and a menu list would pop up with my team's bots name. I click 1, and then a command list comes up. From get flag to kill Bot 5.

Thats actually quite possible if the bots could respond to messages. Speak to them and they would understand, e.g. say "follow me" etc. The GUI will be possible through Half-life's new command menu system, just press shift and it will come up. All you need to do is edit the commandmenu.txt

Good idea, have a bot command menu similer to that of Unreal Tourny, which is quick and easy to navigate, rather then having to type out "follow me" ever time u want a bot to follow you or sommit

Fatal (maker of jumbot) has something were you type "kill Bob" and it goes aftre specificly Bob, or you can do "Bob Follow" have him start to follow you, then type "watch"  hit a special button, or do something special, and he will remember it and do it every time he passes by that spot, you can actually teach the bots new tricks! If this is implemented into OpFor and TFC, maybe even half-life (enouph bots already) then wowwy! we got a good teachable bot, that can bouth be shown things and learn on its own just bye observing!



+=This is all owed to TheFatal for his jumbot=+

what i wish for most in a bot is that it will still run on my pentium 133, i used to play jumbot alot but as soon as i add more than 8 it slows down a lot, i like botmans because i can add about 20 and have no slowdown, keep up the good work botman!

i disagree with the having to TYPE out the commands cause by the time u;ve typed it u could've got killed, i think the command menu would be better, also u should be able to bind keys to "follow" and "guard here" and stuff.
these are just my views but take a tip from unreal tourny as they are the best bots around from any game.

why not do it like the old TF bots for quake??? 

though they were simply done... the still had the ability to accept commands easily!

IE: romeo follow me
 and he would follow
IE: mr.grim help!
he would leave his post to come assist you

Why don't you look at the quake TF source code?

The type in by say commands are a good idea because it will be more similar to normal tfc play... but it would be great if the bot had a gui command option...
