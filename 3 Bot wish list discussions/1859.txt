What are the odds of you inserting the flock code in the hpb bot?

I had wanted to do this at one time, but I doubt that I will ever get around to adding any kind of flocking algorithm to the navigation.

I probably will also never create a method of having them take alternate paths to a goal (other than the shortest one).
