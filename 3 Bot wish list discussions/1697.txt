I was thinking, could maybe those commands be coded into the HPB or Any bot..

I use the Admin Mod, but only have it installed in TFC, so it would be pretty cool if i could see such things in Holy Wars & the other mods the HPB supports.

Would be cool if bots would/could rockthevote too!
Just a lil something to think about.. :)

Actually I think it would be cool if the Admin MOD/Metamod would not ask fake clients (bots) for a menu selection and would just randomly assign a menu selection instead.

Since Admin MOD/Metamod is the one generating this menu, they should be the one supplying a workaround for bots (IMHO).

 By "Menu Selection", do you mean this for example:

<font color="Red">
<b>Change map to badlands?:</b>
1:Yes
2:No
</font>

If you do, that's gone.. And now the latest Admin/Metamod has, 
<font color="Red">// If you are using bots with adminmod you can set this to 1 It will protect bots from recieving client commands which would crash the server.
admin_bot_protection 1</font> 
Which i do have set to 1 in my listenserver.cfg and it does protect me when i have tried some commands that i tried previously in the Admin Mod V 2.10. 
And it tells me that in the console with the "plugin_speech.sma" that i downloaded & installed it says <font color="Blue">Command can not be executed on client, client is a bot</font>. Something along those lines. But are you saying maybe too that they maybe compiled the .dll with this, so that it pays attention to No Bots? I wish i knew how to write a plugin!? Something seems fishy, because i can't exec admin_stack - slap - gag etc. etc. But why is it that i can exec godmode & noclip on the bots ( I can do one or the other at a time OR both at once ). I think if that's possble, then a plugin should be do-able.
I agree with your HO too!! I'm going to ask a scripter over there about this. Cuz they are missing a Cool plugin that i would like to use & it would be Really Really Cool if the bots could use it too! And that is what i see when i sometimes play at Drippy's 2fort ( i was going to post server ip, but it's not online right know i guess? ), anyway he's got some Great scripts! I don't think he runs Admin Mod though, it's a Linux server, so i think he use's that other program that Spokane use's http://tf.bs-linux.com/ hlds_ld proggy.. 

=========
Off Topic, There's another TFC bot out there.. Have no clue what it's called or i don't even have a link to a website and i forget the server i was on.. Oh well, maybe somebody else might know of it? Atleast i think it's new, when i shot at sniper on my team to get him out of my way, he went Right back to exactly were he was standing ( And He held the sniper rifle primed and ready All the time! )..
