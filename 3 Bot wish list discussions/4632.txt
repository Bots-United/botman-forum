After some waypoints for Half-Life DM, pretty please.

I had a HD crash after playing Half-Life DM for ages and ages, and lost the lot. We use a certain group of maps, and of course I'll be buggered if I can find the waypoints I need.

The ones I'm especially after are:

aeodm1
apohldm5
audion
b2dorm
cameltosis
chemlab (our current fave)
deadfall
finaltube
frenzy
hlclinic (another fave)
lost_village2
metagenesis
misnomer
rapidcore
unrest
vacant_town

If we could get our mits on those, that would be sexcellent :)

You didn't really specify a bot, so i assume you meant the HPB_bot.
In this waypoint pack are the following for the (HPB_bot) from your list:

aeodm1
apohldm5
audion
cameltosis
chemlab
deadfall
finaltube
hlclinic
metagenesis

These are all done by me, Thursday, July 17, 2003.
I play tested each one for about 10-15mins. I seen no real problems.
I'll probably finish the rest of your list!? But don't count on it.
Maybe i'll have some of Peter Manson's maps in the next pack.
