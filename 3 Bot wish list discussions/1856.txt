Just wondering if you were planing on doing some stuff? :


- Bots following clients. Just wanted to know if you were going to add that to your bot. It would be nice to beable to msg it and near bots follow you.

- Fixing grenade throwing bug. When the bot throws a grenade he usualy ends up killing himself when he doesnt know what to do durring close encounters + holding grenade / trying to find paths to get away from grenade on ground.

- Bots using tank turrets ect. LOL way out of the scope rite now but it would piss some people off if a bot had controll of them while playing hl dm.

Bots following other players - Nope, I probably won't add this.

Better grenade usage - Nope, I really don't want to spend the amount of time it would take to get bots to use grenades intelligently.  (See Williams discussion of grenade usage on CGF).

Bots using mounted sentry guns (like in stalkyard) - Yes, at some point I intend to get bots to be able to use sentry guns just like human players can.  Probably won't be in there for several months though.
