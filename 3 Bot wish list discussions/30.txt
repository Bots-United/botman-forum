There are 4 other CS bots, if ya wanna play CS go get them Andiod bot rocks and i recommend that one, I feel that seeing as this is the only TFC bot out there u should concentrate it more on TFC then work on the other MODS as u progress. 

Fix the SG bug casue it makes life to easy :)

I don't agree with you!

Keep on working with the bots for CS Botman! 

I think it is good that there are many bots out there for competition!

yeah carry on working on CS, but make TFC the proiraty (or however ya spell it) there is better CS bots out, but theres no compotition on the TFC scene so get a good bot in so theres no chance for the compotition.

We all know that the Andiod bot is the CS king, the navigational systems pisses all over the other bots, can;t ya convert that system to the tfc bots rather then the traditional waypoint system ?

I don't really play CS and don't plan to add anything more to the HPB bot just for Counter-Strike.  The bots as they are don't buy weapons, they don't rescue hostages, they don't plant or defuse bombs, and they probably never will.

My original intent was to create a bot for TFC and that's what I'm going to concentrate on.  As I add improvements to the navigation code or weapons code, all of the bots will benifit from it, but I am not planning on doing anything that is CS specific.

Yah I think he should stop working on CS, I know alot or people use it.  But I think it would be better to start working on Firearms cuz there are not bots :(.  CS has bots already :).

Ye right man!!
Keep on working with the TFC bot..
Just gotta tell you something botman, I was playing OP4 with the HPB-bot and I noticed that if you got too close to the bots they pulled up the crowbar and started swinging it! =)
So I thought I'd try it out with the Spies in TFC and the did the same thing.. (but with the knife though..) and the snipers too..

But the medics didn't use the Medkit.. well anyway..

-=ADDED=-
LoL, I've noticed something really wierd, dunno if it's a bug or what it is, just thought you sould know about it..
I played TFC at the map "cityhunt" playing as sniper, then, when a couple of HWguys arived, they started shoting up in the sky??
Then I realiced it was the "info_player_start" where the camera starts every time you start a map.. 
(In TFC the "info_player_start" has the same "duty" as the "info_intermission" in DM incase you didn't know =) allthough I guess you do)

hey why stop working on cs bot?? it would be great if the bot will be good. But if think too that the TFC bot should be more important to botman, because there is no other TFC bot and you cant play it alone :(.

Priority.

And anyway, Botman did NOT start out to create a CS bot, and he said that, "I don't really play CS and don't plan to add anything more to the HPB bot just for Counter-Strike".

I agree, does anyone out there apart from Botman know just HOW HARD it is to write a Bot that can detect what MOD it is in, decide what rules to follow, and in TFC decide what the map rules are, and in CS detect what the objective is?  Does anyone know how hard it is to write a bot that supports more than ONE mod?  Before Botman everything that is being discussed in this thread was IMPOSSIBLE.  Botman rules, and that is that.

Yes, Botman does rule. You all better respect his skills. And Yes, TFC should be his main concern. Thanks Botman, and keep up the good work! I can't wait to play ver 4!

My personal favorite is Opposing Force.  Everyone seems to have forgotten about that in all the ruckus about CS and TFC.  I think taht he should concentrate on both TFC and OpFor.  It'd be cool to be able to play OpForCTF with bots.  Right now (haven't actually tried it) I think that the bots would make it a team dm game with only humans going after flags.

There's definatly an abbundance of CS bots going on and I'm sure there's a few bots for TFC coming out soon.  But I haven't heard anything about an OpFor bot.  The bot works OK as is in OpFor DM (I played on bootcamp and they did pretty good).  I'd like it to work for CTF too.

Hi, 

Aah i have an opinion too about this. Let see & compare some MODs first and their special rules/mission goals. The more intresting the MOD itself is the more intresting it will be to make the Bot play that.

CS has 2 types of missions: Saving Hostages/Bombing. Nothing very special in that, i think myself, that im bored to make the bot play on that it feels like too common or something.

Science&Industry: Each team much knock out scientists and bring them back to their base and research weapons and stuff or sabotage research equipment. Totally refreshing goal for bots, or programming this for the bots.

Team Fortress: Whoah! It has tons of things player can do, or to be. If i would work on gaming site it would get 5 Stars, 10/10 for its 
amazing Features. Bots like this one, there is huge goal for programmer to gain, to get them play every aspect of the game well. 

Just choose the mod for bot how you see it,
which you like and which you dont like. There isnt never enough GOOD bots for games, Quake1 has
(havent checked just a wild guess) maybe 100s of bots, and half of them arent so good. I think the Bot fewer has increased since Quake1, Quake2 had maybe even more and Then Half-life and Quake3..and Bots are still appearing rapidly. Just make the Bots if that is the thing that makes you feel good and proud of yourself!

I much prefer TFC but it seems that there are far more CS fans out there! goto www.gamespy.com and look on the left menu bar.  They are holding a vote on which Mod is better.  Seems CS is much better for some reason!

Quake 1 fortress i dont like but i bow down to cause thats where it all started.
Quake 3 Fortress is very poor to say its some how related to TFC.  
Only thing i like about quake 3 is that you can say to a bot "Shut Up" and the bot will reply "Make me!".

Yeah, the veterans say (and still say) that Quake1 Team Fortress is the Real Team Fortress. 
Just guess how much ID Software gains poplarity from its Amazing 3D Engines even the Engine is manipulated & changed but they still get all the fame, and good amount of cash from the license and stuff.

ID Software really opened the gates for amazing 3D shooting games. Anyone remember Doom? :) Chainsaw? :D Once i got scared at it so much that i spilled my coffee all over the keyboard, that pink ugly roaming monster attacked me behind the corner. Oops this is now slightly off topic, so,
for correction!. Go on TFC!

I think he`s right because there are many other good CS-bots like NNBot or Android. But there is no other TFC Bot, and there is a lot of work to do, that the Bot will be good

WELL....
