Hello,

Ive looked at the .dem file format and it looks possible to use the data to control a bot.

A link to description of the file format, it is for quake but it should explain the principle.
http://www.planetquake.com/demospecs/dem/dem.html

But i didnt see the source of botman, so my question, is it possible at all?

Thanks

That's basically what the engine does, but if you want bots to follow the storyline of a demo while people are playing, I think you'll have to write a metamod plugin that will decode the .dem file itself. I don't believe you can directly let the engine do this for you. But it's certainly possible, and foremost it's a very good idea. Lucky that botman didn't thought of it yet, you'll get the pride of being the first working on it. Good luck :)

I belive the .dem file packets are encrypted the same way the network packets are encrypted (the .dem file is basically a file capture of the network data being sent from the server to the clients).  You would have to determine where to find the key to unencrypt the .dem packets before the internal data would be meaningful.

I know that the Half-Life network protocol uses Blowfish encryption (you can see references to Blowfish functions in some of the .dll files in the Half-Life directory.

I assume the .dem file contains the public key somewhere at the start of the data, otherwise the engine wouldn't be able to decrypt the packets when running the demo.

It was my intention to post the idea in the "Wish list" forum :)

It will be enjoyable if you think about coding it.

btw. you know the data of a demo is a network capture so the engine should be able to decode it because it does it when a client connects and acting. In other words you "can" simulate a client that connect to a server and uses the network capture (demo). 
But im not really sure.
