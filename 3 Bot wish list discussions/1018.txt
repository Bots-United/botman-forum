How about a way to set the ping for bots, instead of 5. People see this and go "WTF?" Most people have no idea that they're actually playing against bots; they think they're zombie-like human opponents on the LAN.

I haven't tried this, but I don't think you can change the actual ping time displayed for bots.  I believe that the "fakelag" command will only work on true clients (because it is the client that introduces the lag not the server).  You can make bots appear to have a high ping time by not calling the BotThink() function as often (thus giving the bots a slower frame rate), but the ping time displayed in the scores screen will still be 5.

You might want to put a line in you motd.txt file to explain to everyone that the players with a ping of 5 are bots.  Some people don't like playing on servers with bots (even if the bots are able to kick their booties).

"fakelag" is a console command.  It simulates network lag for LPB's.  See this page...

fakelag: adds artificial lag to one or more clients. Any nice server admin will do this to himself. 

Example: I connect to my own server through the LAN. My ping is 5-10. Of course, some people get pissed, and may even leave. So, if my current ping is 5, but I want to make it 100, I would type in "fakelag 95" at the console. I have a shortcut on my desktop that connects to my server and adds lag automatically. The command line looks like this: "D:\Half-Life\hl.exe -game gearbox -noipx -numericping -console +fps_max 200 +net_graph 3 +connect 192.168.0.4 +fakelag 80."

Warning: only use this on the client side! If you type this in at a dedicated server console, or at a console within a listenserver, you add lag to EVERYONE! Only use it to connect to a server on another computer, whether it be a server on your LAN or someone else's server.

There is another command, fakeloss, that adds artificial packet loss. This number is a percentage. If you wanted 3% packet loss, you would type "fakeloss 3."

To simulate playing with AOL as your ISP, do this: "fakelag 900," then "fakeloss 10." :-)
