Well you'll need to download botmans HPB_Bot template, learn some C++, learn a bit about the HL engine and get a C++ compiler :)

I might try it although I am not promising I'll do it :)
I already have a bot for Rocket Crowbar at http://www.botepidemic.com/rocketcrowbot for a taste of my bots :)

what I mean by that is learn how things work within HL first (for example how to use the entity structures)

You'll also need to know a bit about 2d/3d vectors, pointers, advanced functions, structures and library functions such as the ones in string.h (string compares are useful) and standard output to console etc from c++.
