Hey Botman I need to know if you are going to make Sniper waypoints for TFC and camping spots for CS if so tell me about them!

Yes, I have mentioned this before.  The new waypoint system has 2 types of "pause" waypoints.  One for a brief pause (to allow doors to open in CS) and one for a longer pause (20-30 seconds) to have the bot camp at a sniper spot.

Why is it that you "need" to know this?
