Whenever your ready to release the next version of the HPB, do you think that you could look into the sniper code and possibly tweek it so that when the sniper gets blown off his waypoint a bit and is say behind a wall .... Could you make so he'll go back to his waypoint?

Also noticed with the sniper that, when i play spy and go to the sniper loft in 2fort, i start stabbing him and he lets me continue without turning to try and attack me. I was hopeing maybe you could also look into that too.

And last, sometimes i throw the flag to him in badlands and he dosen't respond ( Anotherwards he won't run it to cap ).. "I know, i probably should run the flag myself and it wouldn't happen! But just a idea of maybe tweeking him to run it from his sniper point if i toss it to him".

About the medic, ( I don't think you 'll like this idea/wish.. But here goes ) : Do you think you could tweek the medic to heal you for as long as you call him without a setting of a certian amount of how much health he'll give.? 
It's not really unrealistic, sometimes when i'm online the meds boost you as far as you can take.. --- hehe, not holding breath for you to possibly do this, but it would be nice. ;D

I'll have a look at the TFC sniper code.  Getting them to head back toward a waypoint if they are away from it shouldn't be a big deal.  Also I'll check to see why they aren't responding to damage and facing an attacker.  They won't do this if they already have an enemy and are charging the sniper rifle, but if they are idle and nobody is in their field of view they should turn to face an attacker.  You could test this out by joining a game with just you (as a spy) and a sniper on the other team.  That way you know there won't be any other enemies for them to be preoccupied with.

I was going to mess with the medic healing stuff to make them occasionally heal you to more than 100%.  I'm not sure if the old bug where they wouldn't leave you alone while healing still exists or not (I haven't see it for many months so I may have fixed it).  I guess it does make sense for them to come and heal you if you call them no matter how much health you currently have.  I should at least be able to get them to do that.  Maybe add some random "over-healing" once in a while also.
