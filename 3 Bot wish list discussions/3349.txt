hullo, a mod id like to see, wuld be one that simulates storms, lighting, thunder, rain, snow, and possibly damage, take health and armor, and even maybe kill sumone if there health and armor is low enuff, and can it be made for a tfc server ? if so, i will even beta test it ;}} <wink><wink>, just curious, i really like the work youve done with the monsterm and stripper plugins, they can totally change and will change the way tfc is played :)
