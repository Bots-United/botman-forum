Ive been looking for a bot for the steam tfc beta program (if you dont know what I mean by steam (im pretty damn sure you know what i mean) then go to game-storm.net). I would really appreciate this bot, but ofcourse I will not hold up my hopes as Im sure many other people would appreciate many other bots.

Steam makes bots (and any other plugin type addon) more difficult because the game that's downloaded through Steam is cached in a separate file.  Everytime you connect to Steam, you could wind up (and many times do wind up) with new data in the file (overwriting what's already there).

I've seen several posts in the Steam forums...

http://www.steampowered.com/

...about how to get bots to run (mostly in Counter-Strike, but should work in any Steam MOD).  People would download the Steam content, then install the bot as though it was being initially installed on a person's machine, then play with the bots for however long they wanted.  The problem was that when they reconnected to Steam and wanted to play multiplayer, Steam would overwrite files in the cache and the person would have to re-install the bots again when they wanted to play with bots again (which quickly becomes a big headache).  I never saw any posts where people were able to download Steam content and then "freeze" that version of the cache so that you could install bots and not have to re-install them again after playing on multiplayer servers.

The moral of the story is "Steam and plugins DON'T go well together".

NOTE: This information was from what I remembered from last year when Steam was first launched.  Steam may have changed in the last 9-12 months and may be more add-on "friendly" now, but I kind of doubt that.
