What's new,

1) Re-did "Commandmenu.txt"
2) Pausable  "Individual" Bot Kicker
3) Temporarly Bindable Waypoint Keyz (With Restore Functionality).
4) Furture Idea's Pending..

----------------------

To get this going and have the best success with this menu, there's a couple things you'll NEED to do
first before you extract any files to your TFC directory.

1) Backup your current "Commandmenu.txt in your TFC directory"!

2) Rename your current "config.cfg" to "config1.cfg" .. It NEEDS to be renamed EXACTLY like that for the menu to be able to
"Restore" your current binds. ie: Each bot has there OWN waypoint binds (Specific to that bot), so when you click the button on the menu for the newly added "Waypoint Keyz" it will bind to your current "config.cfg"! So since some people have there own binds, i don't want to be responsable for ruining them. So when you are done touching up OR done waypointing for that session, (Just hit the "Restore Keyz" in that bots menu), what happens is that it will exec your "config1.cfg" that you renamed & whala, your keyz will be replaced. ((Only thing is, that if you should add any new binds in the meantime, you should add them into config1.cfg also, so that you don't earse them when you re-bind waypoints at a later time)).

I really went all out with the pause function .. hehe 
Don't be afraid to use the Waypoint binds, as soon as you click the menu button to use the waypoints for that bot,
the game pause's and the console drop's and will print out the info on what letter/number the waypoints are bound to and
also tells you what that waypoint does!! Remember to use your PGUP & PGDN keys to scroll in the console.

Which brings me to the pausable bot kicker, (i did leave the kickall.cfg in the menu, but put it in the directory named "Special").
How the "Pausable 'Individual' Bot Kicker"  work's: Click it's button on the menu, it then brings down the console and pause's the game. Also it clear's the previous txt out. Then you'll see something like this: # 2 BillyBob[Twit] 6 -- Which means, BillyBob[Twit]'s id # is 6. So say he is the annoyance that you'd like to rid the game of, then just type kick #6 .. Bye Bye Billy.. hehe .. Ok, but wait a minute here, doing 1 kick at a time is time consuming! So let's say you have 3 that you would like to rid yourself of, then all you'll need to do is type this: kick #6;kick #10;kick #5 (((Make sure that you add those semi-colons! AND the space that you see between "kick and #", if you don't do it correctly, it will only kick the first #)))... What else is this feature good for, Those DAM unassigned bots!! hehe ..  (((You do not need to un-pause the game to do the kicking, that's mainly why i made it pausable, "So that you have plenty of time to view the list")))!!

Also if for some reason you don't have a console when you get into the game, no problem, just open the "Special" menu, and it'll exec console.cfg ... I needed that, as i loose my console for some strange reason when i get online and play with humans.

The Files,

Abot_sig_ref.cfg --> Reference file on how to use the waypoint message.
Abot_wpf.cfg --> Abot's waypoint bind commands.
Fox_fwp.cfg --> FoXBot's waypoint bind commands.
HPB_wpt.cfg --> HPB Bots waypoint bind commands.
Odd_owp.cfg --> Oddbot's waypoint bind commands.
stat.cfg --> The Pausable Bot Kicker file. (Works with ALL of the bots).
commandmenu.txt --> The menu. (Works with All of the bots).
Console.cfg --> For activating the console in the game if you need to.
Kickall.cfg --> Still goes to 100.. (Works with ALL of the bots).
Readme_First.txt --> This text.
-----------------------------------

If you have "All" of the bots or not, it's not going to hurt anything to extract all the files into your TFC directory.
