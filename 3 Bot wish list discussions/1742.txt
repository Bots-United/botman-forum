I seen your reply to the "camp" waypoint, so i thought maybe this could be a possible alternative.

The Oddbot use's these.
If you do think it's a good idea, hmmm .. I was going to say make it so you can tell which bot to guard, but i guess you'd HAVE to do that OR i guess you'd have a team that just Guards & never would leave the base.. hehe...
hmmm, unless if you did add this maybe you'd modify the code so that when these were put into a map that say maybe like a random bot would Guard.

Example: ( Let's say i have Guard waypoint{s} in 2fort basement & uptop by respawn & by entrance ).
Soldier Guards base.
Soldier get's fragged.
Soldier resumes back to normal when spawned.
Pyro now Guards the base.
<i>I would think that this should be left to just 1 bot that Guards.</i>

I Love the way you did the chat by seperating the chats..
Ok But what do you think about this:
[bot_chat]
.....
[soldier_taunt]
........
[sniper_taunt]
.....
[medic_taunt]
...... etc. etc. hehe.. I think you understand..

[bot_whine]
........

I'm not sure your going to want to mess with the chat since the other mods use the same variation.
I'm guessing you'd prolly have to code special for TFC.. That's ok, just thought i'd mention and see whatcha had to say.. :) Cuz I'm VERY Happy with the chat the way it is now!

Since I don't have any kind of "zone" system with my waypoints I just think it would be somewhat difficult getting the bots to understand which areas are "defend" (or camp) type areas.  It would be pretty boring just seeing the HW guy sitting on one or two waypoints for the entire game.

As far as the chat stuff goes, yes I don't want to implement something that is only TFC specific.  The bot chat needs to be generic enough to work with all of the MODs that the HPB bot currently supports.

If you like the current chat stuff, you will like an addition I just finished making to the chat code to make them more human-like.  More details to come when the next release of the HPB bot comes out (probably in another week or two).

I understand what u r saying about  the bot chat.

But, isnt your HPB_Bot (except for holywars) made for TFC?

I mean, u don't make waypoints for DM or CS.

Oh yeah, forgot about Frontline Fore

Yeah, you know what would actually make more sense?  Weapon specific taunts like...


how you like the taste of my boomstick?

Ouch, Rocket to the face!

Headshot that will slow him down!

FEAR THE AC!!!

etc etc.....

Kind of seems like overkill to me though, the chat is pretty cool as it is IMHO

I have always wanted to improve the HPB bot in plain old Half-Life deathmatch.  Getting them to understand when buttons need to be pushed to open doors or operate lifts (instead of the way they do it now by just randomly pushing a button when they see one).  Getting them to use ladders much more intelligently (at least on the way up, I still have trouble grabbing a ladder to go down when I'm playing the game).  Getting them to use the sentry guns (like in stalkyard).  Getting them to gauss jump or long jump to places that they normally couldn't reach.  These are all things that I had hoped to be able to add to the HPB bot, but I never seem to be able to find the time to get this type of stuff working.  Many of these features would apply to other MODs besides deathmatch as well so it would benefit all the games that the HPB bot supports.  I'd rather spend time working on stuff that works across all MODs than spending 90% of my time working on something for just a single MOD.

I had hoped to reach a point where I wasn't constantly adding this little feature or that little feature and could go 3 or 4 months without releasing anything so that I would have time to implement these things and get them working as well as I could.  I doubt that I'll ever be able to get some of the stuff that The Jumbot supports, but it would be nice to be able to handle some of the above features.
