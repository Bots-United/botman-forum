I don't like Counter-Strike.  I don't play Counter-Strike.  I'm not going to spend my time developing a bot for a MOD that I never play (same as Action Half-Life, Day of Defeat, Firearms, Vampire Slayer, etc.).

There are many bots (mine amongst others) in the source code of which you can learn how to make HPB buy weapons in Counter-Strike. Just do it yourself :-)
