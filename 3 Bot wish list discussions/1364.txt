Hey Botman

Is HPB working with the newest patch? (1.1.0.6)

Half-Life deathmatch and TFC seemed to work fine for me.  The HPB bots run very fast in Counter-Strike.  I don't know about OpFor or Front Line Force with 1.1.0.6 yet.

If I find any problems with them, I'll post news on my main web page to let people know about it.
