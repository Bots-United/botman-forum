Nevermind. I hosted it untill a minute ago. Only coolDude, and Cavityweasel showed up.

And the lag was awful. Sorry about that. Its probably because I was having connection problems.

The Oddbot ran very smoothly and did a great job.

My total score ended at 158 kills 54 deaths. I was a sniper.

I cant, I dont have access to my better PC on Sundays, I can only host a server on Fridays and Saturdays.
