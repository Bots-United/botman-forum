Botepidemic.com was closed...Ý want to know why?
however freedombot's page (and some pages) unreachable.(because botepidemic.com was downed)
Anyway,http://www.geocities.com/freedombot/ is open,but site includes only freedombot's dust demo version(and wpm tester,botman archive viewer)
i have freedombot alpha 4 and dust demo.!!!
HEY ONSLAUGHT(in turkish:þiddetli saldýrý):
Open your webpage again(fully),release full version of freedombot,and drop me a link when your page is ready!i'm very angry!
Note:Botman(and guys) i'm sorry for this topic,but i hope you understand.

See Onslaught's answer to the same question.
Freedombot is still available on botplanet.
