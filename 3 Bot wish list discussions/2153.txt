a general chat room.  Might help sort the rubbish posts out a bit more.  Such as this one.
Whilst im at it.  Where did you get the name XYZZY from?
I used to play a computer game which used that as a password.

Yes, "xyzzy" is from the old Adventure game.  It's a magic word.  And so is "plugh" if I remember correctly.

"Blinkenlichten" and "J_Random_Hacker" are from the Hacker's Dictionary...

"Was this Atari?"

Hah!  That's funny!  :)

It was on an I.B.M. 360 with a punch card reader and 132 column band printer.

It had some Techtronics video monitors with 25x80 character displays where you could log into the system and run "Advent".

Yes, there was a bird cage that you had to find to capture the bird.  The best part was the "maze of twisty little passages all alike" or was it the "maze of little twisty passages all alike" or was it the "twisty little maze of passages all alike" or was it the "little maze of twisty passages all alike", etc., etc., etc.

There was a chat room set up many months ago.  Nobody used it either.  Why do you think setting another one up would be any different?
