I made a very cool command.
if i type "pausebots" in console, all bots stop in action while you can do anything: run shoot jump etc.

Yes, there was a thread in the Bot Developer's Discussions section about debugging tips and techniques.  That also was one of the things that I mentioned.  (Mine's called "botstart" and "botstop" but it's only enabled when I build the Debug version).
