i have a few kick ass maps, such as as_crazytank, de_wallmart, de_rats_final and cs_mice_final, i was wondering if anyone or botman can make a way point for these maps? if anyone needs them i can email it to them or contact me on my AIM, my aim is M3t4l 4ever

the as_crazytank is a VIP map, where you drive this TALL "crazy" tank, it would be AWESOME if the bots could drive it!!!

I have de_walmart and cs_mice_final waypoints on http://www.geocities.com/thesirclan/pod.htm

to the botters:

I've tried to get bots to drive vehicles before but it never seems to work, the func_vehiclecontrols entity is never picked up by the engine, it is probably integrated in with the func_vehicle so counter-strike probably have their own class to hold everything for a vehicle in it. A lot of people say use FindEntityByClassname to pick up the controls, I've said many times they cannot pick it up, they can't! They don't even seem to be spawned in DispatchSpawn from my experience.

Uhmm... just an idea, Cheesy...
Did you try to get a pointer to that func_vehiclecontrols entity by another mean, such as checking for the ''target'' and ''targetname'' edict_t fields of the func_vehicle entity structure ?

Just guessing :)

nope. func_vehiclecontrols only has a target, but no target/targetname. The func_vehicle does not link to the controls in any way, just the controls that links to the vehicle.

oh, can you get a find entity by target funtion? I.e. search for an entity with a specific "target" Cos you could get the targetname from the func_vehicle and search for something that targets it?

Yes, I think you can.
You could have a look at how you can load the UTIL_FindEntityByString() function, you can have it look for classnames, targetnames and such. Good luck, tell us if it works.

They can NOT drive... yet unless someone comes up with a way on how to do it. Bots don't know here the controls are because they can't find em :/
