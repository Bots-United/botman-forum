Hi

Just thought I'd let you know. If you're going to install the Standard SDK 2.0 (I'm not sure if it rings true with the Full SDK)

Be careful where you install it, I installed it a while ago in the C:\SIERRA\HALF-LIFE (my HL directory)

When I uninstalled it tonight, it thought that the root directory of the install was C:\sierra\half-life

It removed the directory and wiped Half Life and all of my saved games. Ah well, I wasn't that far anyway.

So a warning to you all. DO NOT SPECIFY C:\SIERRA\HALF-LIFE AS YOUR INSTALL DIRECTORY (although that is the default.)

It will delete your Half Life!!


Hope that helps somebody,

Jim

I think the SDK (at least Valve's version of the SDK) will be extracted to "...SourceCode\", so if you install it to C:\SIERRA\Half-Life, it should all be contained in C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\SourceCode.  After uninstalling the SDK it would be safe to delete the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\SourceCode folder (and all folders below it), but of course, you still wouldn't want to delete the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life folder unless you also wanted to delete the Half-Life game files.

If you are installing an SDK other than Valve's (14 Megabytes for the Standard SDK and 80 or so Megabytes for the Full SDK) then you probably won't have this directory configuration.  If you are installing and SDK distributed as a .zip file, then it's not Valve's (somebody else repackaged it).

No, i got it from valve in an installer. 

It's the standard 14MB SDK, and the default directory is c:\sierra\half-life

It then creates an SDK directory there, and an entry the the Add/Remove Programs box. If I just deleted the folder SDK it wouldn't have removed the Add/Remove Programs entry

It then proceeded to delete the C:\sierra\half-life directory as this was the root directory for the install
