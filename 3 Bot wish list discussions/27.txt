I wish, I wish I were a fish!

Seriouisly though, maybe you should make the bots listen to commands in TFC and CS. Like in CS if you say "Need backup" the bots will come to asist you. Or in CS when you say "Storm the front!" they'll storm the front (you get the idea by now).

And in CS it would be nice if they walked a little slower, it seems like they constantly run through enenmy fire at the worst times (I had that guy right in my sights and was about to shoot him when my teammate bot decided to take the bullet for him! Damnit!).

PS. Im glad you added the forums but a small suggestion, add a general discussion forum!

Weird, bigjesus shows 8 posts after each message which admittedly didn't make any sense.

Give me 10 pints of beer and i'll sound similar too. ha
