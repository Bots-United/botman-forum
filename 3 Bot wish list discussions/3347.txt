Could you make something where it would play inside the game  .mov or .avi, or any other video formats. something like a projector or television screen?

No.  You don't have that much control over the Half-Life rendering engine.

You CAN make animated sprays, but they would be small and they only play once

You can also make animated sprites, but they are limited to 10 frames (which is an engine limit and can't be changed by the MOD code).
