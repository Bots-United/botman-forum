Was wondering whenever the next update for the HPB will be, do you think you could add these:

1) Make fireing range longer, like how you did for the sniper. Reason i ask is cuz i was playing prodigal & noticed that if that if the teams are spaced & behind the fence they just tend to look at eachother & neither will fire. I had like 3 bots on each team just standing around.

2) Can you please add some type of switch so that it would turn off the engineer giveing you any armor..

3) I don't know if this a bug or something you added on purpose? But i just got done waypointing ceasefire & i went into observer mode, the bots didn't see me till i took their flag, then they started shootin me. Reason why i did that is cuz i wanted to drop the flag close to base to see what path both teams would take to cap the flag & if they would cap the flag.

4) Engineer & sg's + dispenser building, is there some way you could add to the menu a waypoint # or someting to tell the bot, Ok you built your sg/dispenser here.. Don't bother with looking at the other sg/dispenser waypoints. Concentrate on where you built your sg/dispenser.

I doubt that I'll be making any more updates to the HPB bot.  I've started working on another (yet unannounced) project and it may be several months before I get back to any more bot programming (if I ever do).
