...that the bots in FLF wouldn't rush me with flash grenades while i'm shooting them in the head....i wish that the bots in FLF that use the Heavy weaponry wouldn't kill my whole team in a matter of seconds. :) :) :)

Maybe you have to change the botskill to 5!
Should be better then

ya that might help.  I've got it on 2 right now.  Any support class that uses the heavy weapon can mow down my entire team twice over before finally getting killed.
