Im not sure if you can do this but uh... Or you might be able to but some time later, 
1.) Bots being able to sniper off of 2fort and ledges and ground search from wherever they are.
2.) When ever you call for a medic if there's a bot near he come's to heal you.
3.) Demoman being able to lay pipe bombs around and trigger them when ever someone runs over them.
4.) Engineers being able to set Sentry Guns around.
These might not be good ideas but i hope someone would just agree on me with one of these... O yea and for bots to shoot at SG's instead of walking past them/not shooting at sg's

It's funny you should mention those items.  Stop by my web site later today and take a look at the features available in the latest version of the HPB bot. :)
