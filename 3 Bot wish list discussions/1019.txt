Day of Defeat will be out soon (10th-12th January) and i wanted to ask if you would make a DOD version of HPB cuz i heard it`s a great mod (depending on the screenshots and infos on the DOD site)

I'll download it and take a look.  If I'm impressed as much as I was with Frontline Force then I'll seriosly think about it.  It also depends on how "simple" the MOD is.  Complex game play (like TFC has) requires much more time and effort to adapt the bots to play the game.  The great thing about FLF was that it didn't require much additional coding since the bots already knew how to navigate toward a goal and how to hold down the "USE" key to capture a point (since that's what they use on the wall mounted Health and HEV dispensers in Half-Life).

If the MOD has stuff like driveable vehicles or the bots have to find something then carry it somewhere and use it or any other situations that are fairly complicated then I probably won't work on it since I don't have enough time now to add the stuff I want to in TFC.  Also, if it's "just another deathmatch MOD" like Wasteland was then I won't be working on it either.

There doesn't seem to be much information on the website about what the abilities of the classes are.  There also doesn't seem to be any information about what types of gameplay is supported (capture the flag, attack/defend a point, etc).  I certainly hope it's not just another teamplay deathmatch MOD.

Botman, here are the game modes in DOD;

RoundPlay--Your basic, kill the other team first wins. The rounds are based off a pool of team lives. Whenever a team runs out of lives, the round is over. The amount of team lives and the time for each round will be set by the server. In order for a map to work with round play, you will need to include the appropriate entities and set the correct properties for each. (All RoundPlay maps should include a "dod_" before their name)

Territorial Control--This scenario will involve territories tied to certain areas designated by the mapper. There are two types of areas, one for the allies to guard and one for the allies to guard. When the opposing team takes over another's territory, they receive points based on a certain time. Once a set amount of points is received by one team, the game starts over.

Assassination and Escape--This scenario is a modification of the round play in which, a very important "officer" of the Axis team must escape to an escape zone designated by the mapper. The Officer will spawn randomly in one of the teams spawn points so there is no need to designate a special spawn points for him. If the Officer dies, the Allies win the round.

Destroy the Object--This scenario is another modification of the roundplay system in which designated objects (may be bridges, buildings, special items) that are created by the mapper must be destroyed by the opposing team. Once a team destroys that object (whether by bomb or pure weapon fire) that team wins the round. Each team has a certain object to defend.

"If the MOD has stuff like driveable vehicles"

I don`t think they will add stuff like vehicles cuz HL-engine is much too bad for simulating real car physics (see counterstrike (it`s fun but just for a short time))

"Also, if it's "just another deathmatch MOD" like Wasteland was then I won't be working on it either."

I don`t think it`s a deathmatch mod cuz when you look at the screenies you can see snipers on mountains and other rushing soldiers.
And i hope it will be great cause the team worked on it for a year or so. So i hope it can be another great mod side by side with CS,TFC,FLF.

Well we`ll just have to see.....

This MOD is gonna be the next TFC (in my opinion). So looking forward to it. But a bot would kick ass!!! Yeah but, I remember how botman said that TFC was a complex mod, and that it was alot of work trying to get it to work, and stuff. So I think that he may not have time. But someone else, working only on that MOD, could make one. Anyways, no matter how makes the bot, I'll play it!!!

Huh that download is really big but it seems to be an absolutely Teamplay mod ,so nothing like another Deathmatch mod. Well it will take 4 days for me or so to download it. But please Botman take a look at the mod and post a statement here

I Like DoD! But it's quite laggy online. I'm like 600+ . I watched my nephew play it, but he likes dod_omaha (Also FA'S omaha). I don't know why? Yuck! I checked out all the maps offline to get a feel of what your supossed to do and where things were at, i'd say my favorite is dod_caen. Man, those are some pretty big maps!

 No you don't!? When you play German team it's all in english. Except if you use one of the voice menu's, they "say" it in the German language, but it prints it out as: (Voice)Private Parts: I Need Backup
As comparing it to War in Europe, i would'nt know.. I've never played that mod.

I thought it was kind of fun running around yelling stuff in German.  I just don't know if i like the way it plays online, and the classes don't really seem a whole lot different. I dunno, it's no tfc thats for sure.

I won`t have any language problems cuz i`m german and i can speak english well enough;D.
Hm.. I liked War in Europe 0.65 but since Beta1 it`s not good any more. And Kevin, I don`t think tfc-beta1 was as good as tfc1.5 is now, so we can look forward to see new and better releases of DOD!

No it wasn't as good, but it was pretty close. The team that made tfc was given plenty of help from valve, i dunno how much support this mod is getting from them.

I thought DoD was flat out AWESOME. I play on a good server with someone who I know hosts (Kolyana's Sexy Midget server or something like that) and it is f*ckin fun. Caen was f*ckin fun to kill teammates with the tank. Before anyone calls me a llama or something like that to TK, I couldn't help it, it was just so damn funny. I stopped after everyone got all mad though. If anyone doesn't have DoD I suggest you get it, it revived my love for Half-Life.

Jakal,
Downloadeten Sie überhaupt DoD?  Wenn Sie, Sie mögen es?  Ich würde nicht stören, es zu downloaden, bis sie mit einem Aktualisierungsvorgang zwar herauskommen.  Ich habe da un-installierte Grube und was scheint, eine für immer Warteperiode für sie zu sein zum heraus Erhalten einer Änderung am Objektprogramm!

LOL, also viel davon versteh ich net...
No seriously i don`t understand anything ;)I think you`ve used a kind of translation program, cause when you try to translate it back to english, you can nearly understand the meaning of what you tried to write. I think you should try to translate it back to english with the program, cause it`s really funny to read it in german, LOL.:-)

hehe, ja, i used a transalator.
I typed in english what i wanted to say, then i told it to translate it to german. I checked it out afterwards and it didn't look right, so i figured i could ask you .. 
Oh, well.. There not bad for helpin me read different language, but i guess they won't work the way i tried.. :(  
Thx Jakal... ;)
