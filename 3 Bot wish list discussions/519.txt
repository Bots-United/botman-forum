I'm just wondering if you could make a chat room on your website for your bots where people could come in and ask others about the bots, and how to do things.  I am kinda of curious as to how many people would go to a chat room for info and how to do things in the bots, if there impationt about getting info and help for the bots from the mg board.

No, I won't be adding a chat room.  If you want instant help on a question I suggest you use ICQ.  It is supported by this forum (if you set it up in your profile).  You can see who's online at the time by looking at the ICQ "flower" on the left hand side of the message threads.
