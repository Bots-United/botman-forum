Ok, no bots do this!
Is it possible to have the bots change to a different class at any point in the game when they feel like it? Man, i bet that would probably be a tough one to code.. (If it's even possible).
That would really be cool! ;D

Ok, i really don't think that i'm askin for to much here guy's, so work with me here ok..
I'm brainstorming tonight ok! So here's another one to ponder..

There's these headset type things that allow you to talk to certian people in certian multiplayer chatrooms ok.. Now i was thinking how about someone doing some codeing that would allow us to voice commands to our bots instead of going this route with typeing in the commands.. I mean sheeesh, it would be so much better, as my carpal tunnel is killing me.. ;D ;D

Hey, just remember this, in probably a few more years we'll be able to look back at these post's and laugh!! ;D

Bots should be able to do anything that a player can do (just not always do it as well).  Having the bots change classes or change teams wouldn't be that difficult.  You could even have them send a "say_team" message when they switch teams like, "You guys suck!  I'm switching teams."

The Jumbot has the ability to join a game and leave the server when ever it feels like it.  A bot joins the game, says "Hey, whazzup?", plays for a little while, then says "I gotta go eat dinner now, later doodz!", then leaves the server.

You wouldn't want to add voice recognition or speech synthesis (text-to-speech) to Half-Life unless you have a pretty darn fast CPU (1 GHz or better).  VR and TTS take up LOTS of CPU cycles and would only slow the frame rate down.  It would be possible to add in, but you could probably only have 1 or 2 bots in the game at the same time.  That would be pretty boring.

 yeah i thought that was really cool when they added that to Jumbot , i think it would be twice as cool if the HPb_bot did it. it is kinda usefull for them to change around on teams , maybe later you can have the bots notice that something needs to be done in a map and changes to that specific class to do it , like they notice the secret underpath in rock2 isnt blown up yet and changes to demo and does it himself , or notices there is no scouts to just plain get the flag so he switches to scout , and notices there isnt enough defense so he swithches classes that work for defense , i really think that is a good idead , especially how they would talk about doing it , you can make then rondomly change classes or teams for now , but what i said might be hard but it is a good thought and would make gameplay alot better with the bots , any other suggestions? or suggestions towards my post?

What about letting the bots have a personality, let it remember the player, and next time it connects, it can remember how the player played, and fitt to that type of play. I dunno if it would work, but it would have been WERRY cool

O.K.,O.K. but let Botman first do some jobs on the nav-system and on the bots behaviour, allright?

I don't have any plans to make any changes to the navigation system used by the HPB bot.  I am perfectly happy with the way the bots navigate to a goal using the shortest distance to get there.

I'm not sure what you mean by "bots behaviour", but I won't be adding any behaviorial characteristics (like the Jumbot has) to make individual bots have distinctly different fighting styles.  I believe that that just way to much work to put into something that less than 10% of the people playing with the bots would ever care about.  Perhaps one of the other bot developers will spend lots of time adding of individual bot behaviors to their bots.

No, no i meant the class-based behaviour. For example a spy will disguise himself and try to kill the enemies from behind with knive. I think individual behaviour is a cool feature but isn`t necessare!
