We all know that the hpb bots dont use specials skills. In the case of spy disguising, engie biulding turrets i understand why they dont do it. But why in the hell does the medic not attack with the medikit?!? Maybe im a moron (yep i am), but i dont want the medic to heal but to attack! 
Every bot will bring up the axe (crowbar, knife) and attack. Why does the medic dont attack with the medkit? 

i know i know its chaotic

Well Johnny, for 1 they possibly get killed really fast :)_ & 2 maybe that might be good.

I'm gonna make my bots use the medikit and infect the enemy if he gets a chance to, I still have to work out how to check for ammo then I'll do that.  Right now the medics can heal you if they know if you're hurt or not and if they can see you.
