Hi

How can I make bot to follow an script?

I want make a bot, with no AI, just want from him do exactly want I want.
For example, run from some point to another, wait there the time I say, crounch, switch to his primary weapon, point to left shoot twice, and so on.

thanks
Regards

You'll probably have to write your own scripting system for this.  You might want to look at the scripting stuff in the Half-Life FULL SDK for scripting stuff that is used by scientists, monsters, etc.

Paull if you want a bot to follow a script that would require AI.

In your bot's Think() function, just implement a schedule. At each start of a new task, just read in a file an instruction for the bot, like "patrol x times from xx to xx", "turn 180°", "jump", "go from xx to xx", according to a scripted language you define on your own. Then write the according code for each task, like "void BotPatrol (bot_t *pBot, Vector v_from, vector v_to, int iNumberOfTimes);" etc.
