I am wondering if this is posssible with a bot:

1. Have the bots NOT show up in the player count for server listings?

eg: If I have a 12 player server and there are 4 humans and 8 bots, then the server would show 4/12 and not 12/12.

2. If a human player tries to log in then the bots would politely "log off"?

eg: Bots always dissapear to make space for humans?

Is this possible?

Thanks in advance for any help.

1. Yes, but you will have to modify the code to make bots be based off of the monster code and not use the fake client code used currenly (i.e. bots would spawn, move and die like monsters entities do in single player).  Without modifying the bot code there isn't anyway to have bots not show up as players in the scoreboard or on game browsers like Gamespy.

2. The HPB bot currently does this.  Look at the "min_bots", "max_bots" settings.  If you configure the server for 4 bots max, when someone connects to the server, one of the bots will kick themselves from the server leaving 3 bots and 1 human player.  When a second player joins, another bot will kick itself leaving 2 bots and 2 humans.  When a human player leaves the server a bot will automatically join a few seconds later.

Thanks for the reply!

Re #1:
Is it hard to make that change (if you can code a basic bot)? Are there any other adverse side effects of making such a change?

Re #2:
Is that a common thing with Bots? Or was that something you went out of your way with HPB bot to code?

I am thinking of using these in DoD with Sturmbot, which I know does not suppor thtese features - so I may have to work with those guys to see ho hard such changes would be.

The combination of the above, being available on an Internet server, would be my ultimate bot behaviour (providing the bot itself was decent).

Thanks again for the reply!

1. It is a non-trival thing to change.  If you have done much work with the Valve SDK and single player MODs, it shouldn't be too bad.  If you have done no work at all with the SDK or Half-Life bot code, it's probably going to take you several months to get much of anything working.

2. The automatic adding/kicking of bots is in the HPB bot template source code.  Most of the Half-Life bots that are available started from the HPB bot template source code.  If this feature wasn't removed by the bot author it will still be supported (it's not difficult to do and kind of useful to have so many bot authors may have left that code in there).  Even if the documentation doesn't say anything about it, you can try the "
max_bots" and "min_bots" commands to see if they do anything.  If you get "unknown command" then that bot doesn't support that feature (and it was removed).

To Botman: I'd like to point a thing about bot auto-leaving stuff.
consider the following situation, that happens quite often when you set up small lan parties with your friends.

A server that can support up to 16 players, initially filled with 1 player, and 15 bots.
Then a second player attempts to join ; but he will never succeed, because for the server, there is already 16 people playing, and it can't support more. So the connection attempt will be rejected without even the bot auto-leave code be processed, and so any other player will <b>never</b> be able to join the server if the player count equals the max player value. Unless the master player or the server admin <b>manually</b> kicks a bot from that server.

I worked this bug around in my bot by forbidding addbot commands if the player count equals the max player value less one, and by issuing killbot commands while the player count exceeds the max player value less one.

Hope this helps.

Botman, if you know a way to handle this bug better, <b>please</b> let me know.

I'm afraid your workaround is probably the smartest thing you can do. The check for a full server is done in the engine which *should* care about removing fakeclients if necessary but currently doesn't support it.
