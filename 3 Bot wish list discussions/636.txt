Hmm... i was looking in the tfc eula, and it said you should not :
"(iii)       host or provide matchmaking services for the Program or emulate or redirect the communication protocols used by Sierra in the network feature, if any, of the Program, through protocol emulation, tunneling, modifying or adding components to the Program, use of a utility program or any other techniques now known or hereafter developed, for any commercial purpose including, but not limited to commercial network play over the Internet, network play utilizing commercial gaming networks or as part of content aggregation networks."

Ok, "modifying or adding components to the Program, use of a utility program or any other techniques " well, the hpb bot does something along the lines of this.

Don't worry, botman, if Sierra wanted to punish you, they would have done so by now.

I don`t think valve would say anything against dvelopping bots for tfc, because it`s better for them when someones doing that so because it`s the same thing they planned for mods and it worked: Half-Life is the most played multiplayer game since 2 years and i think Valve can thank all mods and other additions to their game for that

Yep, there's also stuff in the EULA about not "reverse compiling, disassembling, decoding..." of the code used in Sierra's games.

Read the news I posted on July 15th about the e-mail I got from Yahn on the HPB bot...

Yahn didn't seem to have a problem with it and actually offered additional help on the HPB bot if I needed it.
