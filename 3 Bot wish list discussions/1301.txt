RedFox had this posted in his forum as a followup to a question somebody else asked about loading 2 .dll's in Half-Life and boy did i overlook it !! Here's the link he sent the person to:
http://www.cfgn.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?threadid=1056

Sheesh... So i tried it and had some trouble at first with being booted out to windows after my autoexec finished loading, so then i figured it out what to do..
What i did was take the quotes out and bingo was it's name'o .. YES!! Admin Mod + Bots = Fun Fun Fun... hehe .. 

Here's what i did, made the admin.ini and then added this exactly: dlls\HPB_bot.dll   NO Quotes!!!

Oh and i also changed to jag's amx in my listenserver.cfg .. 
Example:
// Change this to point to your version of admin.amx 
// (i.e change cstrike to the mod you are using)
script_file "tfc\dlls\admin_jag_win32.amx" 

Otherwise the default is: admin_win32.amx
It's ok, but it's drab.. What i mean by that is, when you call for a mapvote it'll print to the screen 
"Badlands"
1) Yes
2) No

Now i haven't gotten to mapvote with jag's yet, because i think it's not untill your 10mins into a game before it let's you vote. (Well why have'nt i played over 10mins you ask? hehe.. Cuz i've been playing with other things to see what happens.)

Also when useing jag's and you press your "y" key to say, type timeleft and it tells you how much in mins are remaining, it's also printed out to the screen.. And well it should be no shocker to the server admin, but you can also do nextmap and it will tell you.. LOL! I like. Now i feel like one of the bigboy's, cuz with my connection, i could never support a Real server.. :-) 
So if you want to get the Admin Mod you can find it here: http://www.adminmod.org/

Things to now try as soon as i logoff..

1) Put random "vote_map" in bot's chat file..
2) Put 1 OR 2 "timeleft" in bots chat file.. hehe..
3) Maybe "nextmap" ?? in bots chat file..
4) Find out how Drippy's 2fort does all those cool scripts he has when people make so many kills and the "score" ...

Oh so you know, your liblist.gam should have this in it (of course)
gamedll "dlls\admin.dll"

You want to load that, Not the bots dll in their..

---Modified---
hehe, the other thing that i wanted to check and just tried with sucsess was "how about when i use MBL to launch a TFC game" ..
So what i just did now was to go into my MBL directory and open the "TFC.ini" in their and put this in place of "HPB_bot.dll", because if you lauch MBL without doing this first it will Re-write your liblist.gam file and add back into it: gamedll "dlls\HPB_bot.dll" ..

So what you do is this:

[HPB Bot]
maxskill=5
addbot=addbot <team> <model> <name> <skill>
dll=dlls\admin.dll
size=37000000
waypt=.wpt
chatfile=bot_whine.txt
config=_bot.cfg

hehe.. You'll still see HPB Bot in the drop down and  it won't overwrite your liblist.gam file..

Ok, after haveing tried the random text in the bots chatfile, i have found that even if they say "timeleft" it does not print anything to the screen.. Maybe it's just showing them? But i've seen other's on realtime server's do it and it prints the info to everybody.. Maybe this is something i need to look at in the script myself? Then agian maybe not? 

((( If i can't find nothing then "I wish my bots could (Rockthevote) and do these other cool features that Admin Mod supports" !!! )))

---------------------
I've hit Paydirt!! My Gawd Man!! hehehe.. I'm doing some downloading +Plus some Great reading at the Admin Mod site.. Jag, tells you how to Rip entities with ripent.exe (I guess it's a Zoner's tool). I was looking to do this with a Half-Life DM map, so i could put in some TFC ammo & armour.. Dammit you Developer's ROCK!!!

I use hlds_ld with hpb_bot (linux server). I am doing all the things you speak of. There are no dlls for hlds_ld. My bots say "rockthevote" and it initiates a mapvote. They say "timeleft" and it displays time left on map. They say "nextmap" and it shows the next map. They even try to vote for maps (ie "vote 2fort") but sometimes they say it when no vote is going on (obviously they would). I have been using both bots and hlds_ld in conjunction for several months now. Also Maelstrom, creator of hlds_ld, runs the hpb_bot on his server with is admin and map voting program. http://brewpub.dyndns.org:8000

my server is tf.bs-linux.comhere

Brian, how did you get the bot's to be able to do the say "rockthevote" and it initiates a mapvote (Because i do have those commands in the chat file). And the other commands?
Did you have to set that up in the users.ini file?
My default_access 1 .. <-- Shouldn't that alone let them be able to do the commands?
Well i've been readin and trying different things, but i can't get them to do it.. If it work's for you then it should work for me. Suck's cuz my printer is in the shop, so i don't have a good reference guide while i try these things. I'm jottin everything down that sounds like it should make things work.
Do i need to use the users.ini to let the bots have access?
This is what i've got in mine:
----------
*-=Black Bart=-*:admin:1023
[HPB]Frag_It:me:3
[FoX]-=*Scope*=-:meto:3
[HPB]Cannibal:metoo:3
[HPB]^Rat^Poison:mee:3

------------
( I'm not worried about posting the pass's since i don't host online).
hehe .. I started a lan game and left it at 8 and it said:
execing valve.rc                                                              
execing language.cfg                                                          
execing autoexec.cfg                                                          
NET Ports:  server 27015, client 27005                                        
Server IP address 127.0.0.1:27015                                             
No IPX Support.                                                               
2FORT CFG LOADED                                                              
[ADMIN-MOD] The Server Admin has reserved 14 of the 8 slots. None of the -6   
unreserved slots are left. Try later...

OOPS.. Well, i see that works..
If you can help me Cool, if not.. I'll probably eventually figure out my error. (I hope).. ;D

Just to make sure you know, i'm win32.. Not Linux.
You Linux Guy's are Great! Love playing on Linux server's.. Nice Server you and Maelstrom have!! ;)

Sorry, I can't really help you. I am not familiar with the program your using. With hlds_ld the voting is different. To start a vote you say "rockthevote" then to vote you say "vote mapname" (ie - "vote 2fort"). No authorization level is required to initiate a vote. 

For me it's pretty random and the bots rarely vote. I have never seen them be able to both start and participate in a voting session. Usually it's one or the other. There are no dlls in hlds_ld so no worry about getting them working together. Really the only reason I have the votes say the stuff is for the newcomers to our server. When they see the bots doing it they pick up quickly on how to start a vote and such. 

Thanks for the compliment too. It's been a long time coming. You know, 2 years ago Spokane TF was a part time listen server running on windows with no extra's. Now it's a 24/7 dedicated linux server. There is rarely a free spot on the server for more than 3-4 minutes. Not sure how many connect attempts I get on the game side but we average 2500 web hits a day. I'm sure it's much higher on the game server side as we don't even advertise our website other than in the game. We'll and a few spots like this, when discussing things I've done with a tf server.

Ahhh.. Ok .. Now i see how your doing the bots .. Thx agian Brian!

Everything works fine, except a few commands like admin_stack and admin_teleport .. 
I was playing around with admin_godmode & noclip.. But they run outa ammo and can't access anymore till you turn off godmode.

Here's a screen of hwguy floating around on godmode (out of ammo) 
grubber.hypermart.net/tfc/2fort0001.JPGHwdood Here

But now i'm trying to get the spawn to work and spawn an xen_tree like i seen on AvantiVille -- grubber.hypermart.net/tfc/avanti0000.JPGHere I think if i shut off the cache it'll work?

Extra Healthkits is as far as i've gotten so far -- grubber.hypermart.net/tfc/2fort0000.JPGHealthkits
Admin Mod is alot of fun to play with! ;D

That does sound like fun stuff, but I don't think the average joe playing on the internet would like that wacky stuff. Don't get me wrong, its just not stuff I ever wanted on my server. Therefore hlds_ld and hbp_bot are a perfect solution for me. 

There are a couple things I'd like to add to my server. The main one being an IRC chat room that can see "say" commands from the game and can send "say" commands to the game. Anyone know of someone working on a project like this?

Regulars of Spokane TF wear a tag [STF]. It would be nice if those people could "request" a spot in the game when an admin is on and the server is not already full of nothing but regulars. In other words, get rid of player. I know that admin mod can "reserve" spots for certain people but that just wouldn't work for our needs. We have over 35 active regulars. Yet if we go password protect all the time we don't have enough to keep the server busy. I know I could just use bots to fill it out but thats not what we want. My bandwidth only supports 8 internet players so the bots are just to increase the number of players without increasing bandwidth load (we only use 4 of them to increase to 12 maxplayer server).

I think the problem with this is that you don't know who the person is (comparing the clan tag) until they have connected to the server.  By reserving an slot based on IP address you know at the point when the client attempts to connect to the server who that client is (by IP address) and can deny connections for people not in the list of IP addresses.

I supposed you could implement 1 reservered slot that would allow a player to connect, and then if they are one of the "privileged few" (comparing either clan tag or complete name), Admin MOD could kick another non-privileged player off of the server to free up a new reserved slot.

You might e-mail Alfred about this idea and see if he'd be willing to implement it.  This type of reserved slot seems like it would be more useful (and easier to get around once you knew the secret) than the Admin MODs current method of reserving slots based on IP address.

I still favor the idea of an Internet Relay Chat room connected to the game server for back and forth chat. I had heard of development of such a project and even found a few on the internet. The ones I did find were either not done or had been abandoned. :(

Perhaps I see if Maelstrom has any ideas. I'm very happy with hlds_ld proggy so I doubt I'll be switching to Admin Mod.
