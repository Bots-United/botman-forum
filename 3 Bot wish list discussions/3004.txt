You've said that your done with HPB_bot development.. But you came out of retirement to give us Holy Wars beta 2.0 support (Which is Great)!
My question is, do you think you might step out of retirement one more time to do FLF 1.5 ? ;)

===
hmmm just thinking, i don't have 1.5 yet. But maybe HPB still works with it? But i think there's new weapons.?
I hope this upcoming 1.1.0.9 patch dosen't put the HPB outa commission...
If no FLF upgrade i think BoC-bot has it & a couple others? But nothing is more Fun than the HPB! hehe .. ;D

Yes, I plan to support FLF 1.5, but I don't know how much effort I'll put into supporting new game play modes.

I'll definitely update the HPB bot so that the standard capture the point stuff will work (adding any new entities and whatnot).

I don't think you need you do anything..
I just played useing HPB_bot 2.0 with the 3 wpts that come with it & i had no problems.. Bot's played same as usual.. 

Only thing wierd that happened is when i was playing flf_village .. I was a Commando, when for some reason i had we had just won while attacking then it made me an attacker agian & switched everybodies uniforms.. We were Green when it started, but then we became blueish like the Rebels & Rebels all went Green.. LOL!! Lucky i had icon support on.. But the FLF Team made a Really Cool VGUI Helpmenu which you can access by clicking "H" <-Default key .. Must be a bug left in?

So then i guess you'll probably not support this:
- - - -
Finally, in 1.5 a key-capture mode was implemented. So far the only map with this gameplay mode 
is flf_sogem

Key-Capture FLF
---------------
This mode is exactly like 'Classic' FLF, except you need a keycard to capture the Capture Points. The key
card spawns near the Defender base and may be grabbed by any attacker.

If an attacker is killed with the key, the key drops and remains on the ground until picked up by another
defender, or until 45 seconds pass (at which point it respawns at its original location
- - - -
Atleast it's only 1 map..

I take Hotbot, which is not in the list because I do not know the website. When you want to have it, contact me on ICQ: 122244122

 huh? HPB_bot is, i've got some waypoints "fresh" that i did & me & my nephew played & had a blast! I'll upload them to my webpage.. [url]http://grubber.hypermart.net/flf_16/[url] ..
And The ODDbot did still support FLF 1.6 with the 1.1.0.9 patch but i haven't tried since this 1.1.1.0 patch.. It probably should still work? If so and you know what your doing, you can convert those HPB_bot waypoints to ".owp" for the oddbot.. And if you need "The ODDbot", you can dl it here: http://grubber.hypermart.net/BotMixer5000/tfc/TFC_Mixer.htm ... It comes with a whole bunch of flf waypoints, but i don't know if they work or not? And also be aware that "The ODDbot" is a now deceased bot.. There is no support..

One last thing, i just took those waypoints off my CD, so if any problems just right click & goto properties & remove the "Read Only" attributes.. Should be no problems though.. And i do have antivirus protection, so if you dl that ODDbot zip it should be fine! But scan it yourself just to make sure.. :)

When i get the gusto, i'll put up some sort of flf webpage.. hehe..

Thx so far, but what I ( also ) ment is... 
What is there no freak like Count Floyd with his Podbot ( Counter-Strike ) or Sturmbot for Day of Defeat. This would be very good for the mod...

Oh, so you want an author that is currently working with FLF.? Have you tried out http://www.bocbot.de.vu/
There's a forum so you can suggest that BoC-Bot peform like Podbot or Sturmbot (It already does i think). And currently Zneaker -author of BoC-Bot re-wrote much of the code & it's in (V2.0 test c) so you should try it out & give him some feedback.. BoC-Bot is a Good bot, when i play Firearms Zneaker has combined a little of both Podbot & Sturmbot = "I think the bots can go by commands? Hmmm, i have testversion a though.. You can always suggest the command thing. They do them in the CS & FA versions. And they prone like Sturm" as long as there are "Prone" waypoints in the map..

Go make some suggestions to Zneaker..

Thx, my thingking was in the way that the mod has a better change for players when there is a good mod support. I myself would play it more often having one.
