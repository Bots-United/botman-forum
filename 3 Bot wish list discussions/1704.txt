Just a friendly suggestion, I'd love to see Hunted support added to HPB bot. I've suggested this a few months back but I guess there were more important things to code at that time.. now I finally have a decent computer (P3 1ghz) and am going to download everything over again, being a huge fan of TFC and especially anything than your standard CTF (ie, Hunted!) it would be very impressive to see a bot who could play as the Hunted, bodyguard bots who would protect him (perhaps a few of them going out first and clearing the way, always 1 or 2 bots designated as his personal body guard and would always be in front of him) and assassin bots who would camp on the buildings and hide in areas to try and stop him from getting to the garage..

I'm curious botman, why can't you simply acknowledge if you have any plans to add hunted support? Is that too much to ask for? (You act like I'm asking for the end of the world and your response is "No Comment.") You ignore my emails (even from bot epidemic) and now the message board as well.. what seems to be the problem?

Making the bots guard the hunted is not a trivial thing to do.  This involves fairly complicated team play tactics where the bots stay in a small group and don't run off heading towards enemies.

There have been many discussions about the best ways to implement team play and flocking tactics in the "Bot developers discussion" group on my forum.  Most of the developers agree that implementing good flocking algorithms is not trivial.  There are many special cases that you have to take into account (for example getting the bots in a squad to gracefully get through a doorway without clogging everything up 3 Stooges style).

The military AI in Half-Life had the beginnings of such flocking and squad tactics but even Valve's code had problems with handling this type of navigation.

I don't have any plans to implement any sort of squad or flocking behaviour necessary to get hunted style maps to work the way that they are intended.  For right now, you'll just have to settle with the bots playing the hunted style maps as though they were team play deathmatch and hope that the civilian is lucky enough to get to the escape point.
