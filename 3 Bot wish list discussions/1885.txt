You know what else would be "kewl" is if you could get those bots to answer stupid questions on this message board. LOL!

Oh and also if you could get them to go to work for me so I'd have more time to play games. ;)

Yep, I plan on adding that, plus trying to get medics to overheal you once in a while and also trying to get the snipers to move back to the sniper waypoints after they have been blasted away from them.
