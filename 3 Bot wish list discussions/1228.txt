Oh, i hate when that happens, when the link is that of which it's not supposed to be. But it didn't matter, cuz i was kinda hope'n a bot for DoD was going to come out sooner or later. It grabbed my attention, so i decided to download the DoD update and try it out. I see the bots don't even look at waypoint's when you place them, but my mistake was to have botskill at 3, those dam german snipers kept taking me out with 1 shot, worst was i could'nt even get a chance to see my killer.. So i restarted it and put the skill at 6, that was much better, but still gota watch those sniper's.. Yikes!! I haven't played online yet, but i hope it play's better then it did... Hope the next version of BlitzBot is a bit better.. (& waypointable).
