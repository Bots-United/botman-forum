I am trying to download bots but when i click download at the site it doesn't resiave anything/  I was wondering if there are any other sites that have your bots on them?  or if someone can e-mail me them?

Sometimes fileplanet.com has server problems (like they were having yesterday).  Sometimes this effects the downloads and sometimes it effects this forum.  Usually they get things straightened out after a few hours (or a few days).  When this happens again (and it will), just wait a few hours and try again.
