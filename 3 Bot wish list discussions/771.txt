I dont know if this has been asked before.

But dont you think that would be more realistic in TFC? Many people do that (except for the lam3rs that constantly rush).

Especially the ones who hide out in the respawn rooms.  Man!, they hardly EVER get killed!  ;)

Lol

The only way people can get killed in respawn rooms is either because :

a) After prematch Time
or
b) If the enemy gets in

or
C) FF is on and some teammates are getting pissed :)

Right now the Ares bot strafes but it kinda blindly rushes. It also builds SG's and heals you if you call for medic. It's a pretty impressive bot right now.
