I told some of you all before to a game with bots on a TFC server. I still stand for that.

If you guys wanna play against me, post the date and time you're available to play and Ill decide from that.

The rules will be simple; no one joins blue team, everyone joins red. The map will be 2fort. I will be on the blue team along with a bunch of bots.

Thats it :)

The server will use the HPB bot beta 4.1

And yes thanks to windows 2000's excellent remote terminal program.  I will have full access to said computer, which means that i can install bots and restart it should it crash.  Much fun to be had for all!

None yet.

I just wanted to get something straight though. I plan on hosting the server. I have a good, fast connection so it shouldnt be a problem.

Just tell me your times that youll be avaiulable to play and Ill decide when it will be based on that.

Since the network is switching from DSL to a T1, i am not sure if the ip's will stay the same as they are now.  I Will let you know as soon as i find out for sure.

my latency is like 300-350 but lately when i play over the internet it gets really really choppy. i dont know if its just the fact that im not used to it or its worse with the bots installed.

My ping is usually about 200 to 250, I just find anything much higher than 350 unplayable.  I have no clue where your server is but if your ping is that high, i wouldn't expect it to work so great as a server.  We will have cable at my new place, my ping should be around 30 to 40 then.


So you can EAT THAT!

Zach, what you need to do is get one of the better US robotics modems.  Then your ping should improve.

a good USR 56k is probably around 100 bucks, well worth it, when i got mine my ping went down like 150 to 200 less.  Any of the us robotics 56k's that don't have winmodem in their name are great. expect to spend around 100 bucks for the good ones

--------------------------------------------------
I stated in the first post; the HPB bot.

If all goes well after that match, your bot (Abot) will be used in the next match I host.

If all goes well, well use that other bot thats out there (cant remember the name). Sound fai? That way were basically testing all the TFC bots and comparing them.

jeez matt, your really getting into it.

as for T1 line prices, if there are no lines that you know of around you, you will have to get it run to your house and that will cost extra, i believe it is around $100 bucks a month.

T1 prices, ha.  I know for my friends network, which has our server on it.  He said it will cost $1000 dollars more a month than the DSL was, I am not sure what the DSL cost but i am sure it was a lot since it is a decent sized network. This is a commercial network that he is admin of.  I doubt T1 will every be offered for residential use.  Anyway, cable is great and affordable. I have friends near here that are using comcast and they have pings, between like 30 and 60 on servers all over the country.  I think i could learn to live with that, I remember the network we had at work last year it was mostly old amd's and p1's hell average ping on that lan was like 80 to 100! hehe

my ass, my friend pays $100 bucks a month in boston, mass.  and yes you can get T1 in residential areas, it just costs extra to get it put out there.

You better get your facts straight there son.  There is no way in the world you are going to get a dedicated T1 line to your house, your friend is very much full of it. The only people that could afford to get a dedicated T1 line to their house would be people like bill gates, or maybe micheal jackson.  That is just the way it is, your friend is a liar if he said he has a dedicated T1.  I mean kids at college can hook onto their school network and use a T1 sure, but that is not a dedicated T1 and it is not residential.  In the future, you should try to be less gullible Zach.
