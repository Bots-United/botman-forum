but i really wish you had a mailing list for letting people know that you have released a new bot or have updates some news.
Im sure alot of people would be interested in join it.

I tried that a long time ago and the list server that I was using would either send out double posts to people or it would be down at the times that I wanted to send out an update.

I have a list of about 10 or 12 news sites that I send release information to (planethalflife.com is one of them).  I check PHL daily for news updates on various MODs and other Half-Life related stuff.  I know that many people don't look at PHL very often, but I diliberately make my main web page quick to load so it should only take you a few seconds to check the latest news to see if anything has been released recently.

Why not just set aside a webpage for new version announcements. Then people can bookmark it and setup their browser settings so that they're e-mailed every time that page is updated. Problem solved?

Um, doesn't Botman have a news page, uh huh I think he does. I guess most people run to the downloads or forum and dont even read it :).
