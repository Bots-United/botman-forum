Hate to ask a newbee question, but how much bandwith does each Bot use up? I have a cable connection which is limited to about 300K uploading. The dedicated server can handle about 10 Human players. How many Bots could I add to the game and not slow things down?

I have tried it at 18 bots max and 10 min - seems ok.

I would love to up that to 30 person server with 28 bots max and 20 min.

Any advise would be great!

The machine is a Overclocked 900Mhz AMd @ 1.1 Ghz
256 megs ram
Windows 2000

The bots use up zero network bandwidth since the are running internally in the Half-Life engine.  They DO use up CPU power though.  With a 1+ GHz machine you should be able to handle about 20 (or more) total players (so if you can handle 10 humans players, you should be able to add about 10 bots).

Keep checking the frame rate on your server as you add bots.  If the frame rates starts dropping down below 30 FPS you've probably maxed out the server.
