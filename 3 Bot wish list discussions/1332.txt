would it be possible to get the waypoint files in one big zip file, it would be a lot quicker than downloading one by one. i think your bot is the best bot for tfc. i have just got back into playing tfc after 6 months without the internet. and now i can play at any time without connecting.

I don't offer individual waypoint files.  All of my waypoint files are included with the bot.

Here's a list of web sites offering waypoint files...

You might e-mail the admin's of these web sites and ask that all the waypoint files be bundled into one zip file, but it's kind of a big pain for someone to do this everytime one of the files changes.  Besides most people don't play half of the maps that have waypoint files available for them.
