Have you heard of it? NNBot was cancelled, oh s*** it`s the best bot out there i hope it is just a joke of ditlew or he`s going to start NNBot 2 early next year. I hope the NNBot won`t be a second Android which page was updated once in three months.

well.... life goes on :(

Hi there!
I have stopped the development of the NNBot due to my studies. I have plans for a NNBot 2, but I have to pass my exams first. This means that there wont be a new NNBot this year. This will ofcause mean that the other great bots will have a chance to become better, while NNBot stands still. I dont mind this!



He's saying that his studies are time consuming for [b][i]now[/i][/b] But he'll be back next year.

Beside's Jakal, this is botman's bots: Bot wish list discussions, not for the discussion of another bot. Now what you should have said was (Hypatheticaly):
Dam looks maybe possible that one of my favorite CS bots might be ending, botman even though i know & Read that you'll probably be doing no more coding of your HPB CS Bot, could you please reconsider!? I've purchased webspace and will host your HPB Bot just so that you might reconsider.... Thank You Very Much botman! I've also emailed you so i could find out where to send money's to further such progress. ;D

hehehehe

O.K but who knows. He won`t stop studying 2001 so that will take a lot of time again.

Excuse me but there is no general discussion. And the NNBot is based on the HPB_BOt sources so i think we can talk about other bots in this Forum too!

I like the NNbot, but personally, (if I played CS) I would use the POD bot. It just seems, way intelligent. Im not saying the NNbot isnt, I just dont like it that much.
