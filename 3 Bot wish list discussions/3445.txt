I have a couple suggestions to make your bot more human.

Bots being able to talk to eachother, as well as the bot_taunt and bot_whine. But normal, friendly chat messages. Something like;

Bot: How are you doing today, Bot2?
Bot2: Fine. Never better! And you Bot3?
Bot3: Doing great!

You can have the messages randomized if you want. It's just annoying when you see that any bot can say any of the messages. You already know what they will say cause you had them say that. That comes to another suggestion. Bots saying their OWN lines. Say like Bot1 has his own set of chat lines, and Bot2 has his. You could put seperate .cfg files for every bot you got. That to me would make the bot more human. 

Another thing, have bots say what you didn't want them to. Entirely different things then those setup in the bot_chat area. Say like this 1 bot would say "who's the man now???" when you didn't tell him to say that. Have an internal file that could randomly pick, but have a long delay.

And 1 more thing. I find it annoying when bots say something they said about a minute ago. I believe their should be a checker thing that would hold the bot from saying the same lines for longer then 10 minutes. That will also make it appear more human. Let it say every sentence in the sections, instead of the way it's doing now.

With these new improvements, I believe the bots will talk just like human players. The way it is now, no offense, but it doesn't feel too human to convince me.

This is gotten around fairly easily..

(First, the non-technical explanation)
I personally disable the bot chat portion of their "vocab" because they tend to go on and on..  But..  If you tone down the chat percentage (very low) and add things to their vocab files like several different ways to say "yes" (yea, yep, HECK YA, You said it.., absolutely!) and then have questions..  (Anyone else thing %n muffdives?)

(the more technical explanation) 
What you're doing by adding more ways than one to say various things is raising the percentage that they will reply in the affirmative and, at the same time, reducing the likelihood of getting a repeated phrase within a close time span.  And, like with "Adlibs" (anyone else remember that game?) you can have massively funny conversations going on between people and bots.

The bottom line is.. if you're having repeats then you haven't added enough to the file.  Botman was nice enough to give us a VERY easy to follow framework, but it's up to you to customize it.

If you want to see how the bots work with a more... mature lingual setting.. check out my website and get the IP from the (server info) page.

I see what your saying there. I'm already at the limit of each part of the bot_chat.cfg file, and bots tend to ignore any phrase that's past the 100 phrase limit. I'm 'painfully' deleting those phrases that are past 100 to allow them to say all of them. But they still keep repeating what their saying.

But I have added some good ones in spite of that, such as;
"Ok %r. Now your turn to say something someone already has."
"...and she was like "Yeah, Whatever!" %r: Man!! Holy Cow!!"
"Everyone... This is not a Chatroom, it's a Battleroom."
"Didn't you already say that %r?"

And others like that.

Now I'm no coder or even know what the heck C++ is. I used to program long ago when I had a Color Computer that had a book of what to type and put in. That's the ONLY way I knew how to code.

I'm just saying the only way to make them more human, is to chat like a human. Not say the same thing someone else said 10 seconds ago. It just gets boring overtime. Even totally disabling their chatting, is even more boring.

I have chopped down their bot taunt and whine percentages though. Cause that's all they did. Now they chat more instead of taunt and whine.

It would be also cool if bots would respond to your chats instead of feeling like your wasting your breath and talking to a wall.

But I know what would be the coolest thing, bots being able to use their mics and talk. BOY would that be awesome! Of course, you would have to make your own recordings for the bots and put them in a directory for them to say just like the chat file.

But I know botman isn't going to add these features in because of the releasing of the source code. I remember the 1st time I downloaded it when the bot was still new, seeing all of these strange file names and 'computer laungage'.

BTW, this is still Ben if you don't know.

with joebot you can e.g. define a seperate chat file for each bot and phrases won't be repeated from one to the other second, there has to be some delay ... although the last point isnt very elaborated at all :)

joebot is open source and hosted on sourceforge, so if you like to improve the chat - you're welcome :)
