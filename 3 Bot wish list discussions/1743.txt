It would be a great thing when you make a bot for the new mod Global Warfare. Its a mod with potential. it has manny bugs and its very komplex, but it makes much fun. i now that making bots takes much time and you don't get money for that butyou are the only can make this!
Sorry for my english, i am a croatian who lives in germany.

thanks for your bots, they made me to a better player

I haven't downloaded it yet.  Maybe somebody will make a bot for this MOD if the MOD is fairly good.

I've been waiting for The Opera to get finished so I can download it and compare it to Action Half-Life.  They sound pretty similar, but The Opera also seems to have some game play mode that supports monsters of some sort.  We'll see how good it is when it finally comes out.

Global Warfare is an excellent mod and well worth down loading. It would be a shame if you did NOT make bots for it so please do!
i might try and make some but i have no experience at all and you are the best bot designer we know!
Please consider
