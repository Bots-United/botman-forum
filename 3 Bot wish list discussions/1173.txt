Once I get the weapons selection stuff extracted out to a text file you will be able to do this yourself by removing all the weapons except the crowbar.  Alternately, if you don't like the crowbar, you could remove just the crowbar instead.  Any of the weapons that you don't want the bot to use you will be able to remove from the bot's selection of weapons.
