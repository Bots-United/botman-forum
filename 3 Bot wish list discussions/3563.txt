Hi botman, 
As I've mentioned before, I'm a big fan.  Love the MONSTER MOD and the bots.  I have been running the bots on my HLDS for almost 2 years I believe..  Well it's been awhile anyway.  I have a few light suggestions on them though.  I'm not the coding wiz, so I'll keep everything very mundane :)

First, I run a low G server and with the new update to the bots.. they are.. very squeamish about tripping edge_friction zones (falling off edges, bridges, whatever).  For example.  My waypoint file for Badlands has them dropping into the flag well and walking out via the ladder and checking the front door area.  But with the new patch they freeze at the lip of the flagwell (even though it's low G) and won't jump in anymore.  So I get a line (basically) of bots waiting for that first guy to get the nerve to take the plunge, haha.  They dont' have a problem if there is an aquired target below them though.  Would there be a way to fix this?  Or maybe put a toggle in the CFG file where they revert back to the pre-1.9 patch suicidal mode?

Next I was curious if there would be a way to code the bots to recognize speech to a degree?  Simple things like.  HEAL or ARMOR while in teamspeak would bring the medic in your area to you to heal, or to fight if there are valid targets present, etc.

Lastly.  Is there a way to get the bots to target MONSTERS?  I know it probably wouldn't be easy to tell bots that an entity that isn't on any team would be a valid target.  But if you could it would make the marriage between the two mods more seamless.  Right now, as you're aware, the bots ignore them and get ripped apart by the monsters.  

Just thought I'd share a few ideas.  Love the mods and the plugins.  Doing a great job!
