Just a pat on the back for you. I've been with the HPB bot since the beginning, remember when the bots didn't shoot back ;)
It's come a long way in a short time.

Mooncheese is my current favourite map, thanks to the guy that did the waypoint file for it. No i've not seen a bot fly to the moon in the rocket yet, but the other day a pyro got real close, but he fell off the entry platform. LOL
I enjoyed throwing the flag onto the top of the rocket. LOL

Any suggestions that i have are ones that i know that are currently being worked on. Mainly the pain of the medics always shooting the nailgun (he's pretty lethal with it too) I shot a medic right up into the air with a rocket and the bast still fired accuratly at me as he slowly descended back down to the ground, and the Engy always firing off those green lasers.

I just installed the latest beta and the bots have much reduced as regards to jumping in the air and spinning on the spot.

Another thing on my mind, say for example going across the bridge in 2fort, i can see the red sniper dot on me, and no matter how much i duck and jump to try to avoid it, he will always manage to get me, once the red dot is on me, it "sticks" on me no matter what i do.

These bots are getting to be quite a lot of fun.
Thanks Again, Stephen

Yes, the little bastards are starting to tick me off as well.  I hope to add a more realistic aiming modification to the next release of the HPB bot.  I want to be able to have a configurable reaction time and a configurable "tracking accuracy" to better simulate the way humans aim at  enemies.
