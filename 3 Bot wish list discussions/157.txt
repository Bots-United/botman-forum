 I heard you saying you might release it tonight even with the bug in there, maybe you can make it a pre release or somethin then make an update to fix it later,just a suggestion, reply to this message and let us know

I wish pigs could fly!  (but they can't).

I don't want to release something that doesn't work.  I don't mind minor problems, but when the bots just go back and forth between two waypoints it makes it worse than the Alpha 3 release.  Just hang on another few days.  It will be worth the wait, I PROMISE!!!
