Test report:
Combat behavior
As soon as sees ducks it offered an opponent or branches back themselves.  It pulls either to garnet, if it bought one and the opponent is distant somewhat further or shoots at it.  The angschossene opponent ducks itself immediately or branches also, if he cannot see the opponent turns he itself.  Movement behavior by the
waypoint system is avoided that offered constantly at walls more festhaengt.Der offered functioned on all Counter Strike maps, but on those where no waypoint system is available hangs he unfortunately often on walls fixed.  Own opinion it can keep up almost with the PODbot, in some places must it however still something be revised.

Valuation (6 is the best):
It got 5 stars
