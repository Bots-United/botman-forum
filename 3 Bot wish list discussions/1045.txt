I have a suggestion.  I think you should be able to flag an order number on capture waypoints.  So the attacking bots will not try to capture a point that is not possible to capture because they have not captured the previous point.  I use special waypoint paths to try and get bots to get the points in the right order..but sometimes it doesn't work(ie. flf_fox) Having the bots know which points to get first, second, third, etc would be ideal.

Yes, I also wanted to implement a sequential waypoint method for situations where a bot must press a button then go through a door or use a lever then walk across a bridge, etc.

It wouldn't be that difficult to assign a "tag" to a group of waypoints (so that they are somehow associated with each other) and then assign sequential numbers to them so that the bot uses then in a particular sequence.

I'll probably never find the time to implement this feature though.

Hi,

Tried the odd bot ??

it doesn't like fox much, but they work well on job and lombardi.

They have a check waypoint that tests dynamically whether the waypoint is reachable.
