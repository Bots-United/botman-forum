Ive noticed that once low gravity is on the bots really dont handle it well. I was wondering if it was possible that maybe you could create "low gravity waypoints"? or maybe just have them understand more what the gravity is set at. Like if its normal they jump like normal but if its lower than normal they will make jumping a last resort or something. I dont know Im not real educated in MOD createing or Bot createing. Also Ive noticed that snipers will either not charge up much at all and shoot you or they will shine the light on your head until they are charged which actually gives you lots of time to take your shot. So maybe they could decide when its best to take the shot instead of worrying about rechargeing. Sorry for my spelling I cant spell worth crap.

Bots have a difficult enough time with waypoints when gravity is normal.  It would be VERY difficult to get them to handle low gravity settings properly (it's the same type of problems as getting them to handle swimming in water properly).

The TFC sniper weapon charging time is random.  Sometimes they only charge it 0.5 seconds and sometimes they charge it much longer.  The biggest problem is that once they lock on to you with the sniper rifle, no amount of dodging back and forth will keep you from getting hit.  I hope to fix this aiming "problem" in a future release of the HPB bot.

Well maybe could possibly seprate that and add it to the hard difficulty? It is more of a challenge since of now the Bot Snipers arent real good. Not critizing them at all I love them but of course they dont match up to a human. And the locking on thing is pretty difficult makes you have to make shooting a Bot sniper top priority otherwise your back in respawn heh kinda how it is online and against non AI players.
