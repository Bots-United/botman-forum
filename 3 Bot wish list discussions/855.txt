Curious to know if anyone's planning on doing bots for it when it's released.

I was planning on adding support for Arg! in the HPB bot.  I downloaded it this weekend to check it out... I think I'll pass on it. :)

That mod looks ok but why in the hell do they only have a few models with that big of a team? They have like 3 models and like 15 people in their team...

True you would think people would jump at the chance to model for that mod.  I wonder if people are scared of pissing off capcom?  The maps looked pretty sweet.
