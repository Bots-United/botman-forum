Hi Botman,
I'm a big fan :) 

Been running your bots on my HLDS for about.. sheesh it's been awhile now (2 years?  maybe not quite that long but sure feels like it).

I added the MONSTER MOD and have some suggestions for it.  My regulars LOVE the monsters and always (almost irritatingly regularly) ask for monsters.  I'm tryin to work on a way to script a vote for whether or not the monster spawn switch is turned on (via admin_mod) but what I'd like to see.. is some kind of switch to turn on random spawning by players.  I.E.  Coding it so a random (variable1)player is caught with (variable2) monster in (variable3) quantity at (variable4) time or at (variable5) frequency.  Where variable is, of course, randomized.

Also, would like to hear crowbars/knives make something other than a "metal clang" sound when beating monsters.  For some reason there's nothing more satisfying than denting the head of a bunch of scientists with a crowbar...

And, of course, would love to see the monsters able to move more often and less reactively to players.  (I.E. the hgrunts are about the only ones besides the snarks that appear to wander around with any frequency while waiting for a player to show up)

And, the last thing, the apache helios keep getting stuck on players when spawned by them.  Is there a way to add to the z location in the x/y/z enough to keep it from sticking on them when spawned?

That's about it.  I know it sounds like a lot.  But we really like them and would like to see them grow too :)

Thanks again.
