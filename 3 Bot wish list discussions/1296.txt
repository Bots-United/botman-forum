this is totally not critical, but somewhat annoying... some posts in the forum, no matter how many times i read them never get unflagged 'new' 
like this one:

http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=1283

and this one:
http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=2&action=display&num=1294

anyone else have this problem?

YaBB has a bug where if anyone edits a message, it will ALWAYS show up as new.  This is due to the way it keeps track of which messages you have read.  In order to fix that bug, everytime someone edited a message, the YaBB code would have to scan through all users data files and update the timestamp for that particular message (if that user had previously read that message).  The other alternative would be to re-timestamp the modified file with the original timestamp (instead of updating it to the current time).  I don't know how to modify file's timestamps in Perl.

if this perl happens to be running on a unix-like server you can do 

`touch --date="Jan 01 2001 12:43:00" $filename` 

and it will timestamp the file...  (i assume you have access to the files and the perl code?)

if you just want to do it straight in perl without using shell utilities, use the 'utime' function...

Yes, I have access to the YaBB Perl source.  Unfortunetly the gamespy servers are NT (not unix), so if I was able to fix it I'd have to use the utime Perl function.

I never did figure out what caused the -1 replies on messages.  I assumed it was someone creating a message then editing the post and removing all the text in an attempt to delete the post (normal users can't delete things once they are posted), but I was never able to duplicate this bug.
