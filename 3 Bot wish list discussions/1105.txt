Botman shouldnt make it for Science and Industry because

1. Science and Indistries is kinda complicated and I would imagine it would be hard to make a bot for

2. Botman shouldnt waste his time on it because most everyone here wants it to focus soley on TFC. Someone else can make one for S&I

 Botman needs to post something on the homepage to let people know he will not try to work on any other mods unless it's not to complex or just plain deathmatch , we get too many posts like this.

hey, i think youre right, but remember tfc is not the only mod out there, and (in my opinion) its geting a little boring... 

Yesterday, after adding the post i looked into the botmans links page, and looked at the odd_bot page. Its very good in tfc and in flf. It has attack, guar, follow comms. But that isnt the main thing... The bot plays S&I. Orr maybe it plays until its fraged (after then the game goes crazy and crashes after 10 secs). The feature is maybe not undocumented, and at the page writes that the mod is now unsuported. But if you modify the liblist.gam, and copy the odd_bot.dll into the si dir it will work and play. It can cap scientists, use weapons guard etc. 

And youre right botman should concentrate on tfc... I like the thing that there are many followers (maybe they are copying botmans work, but they are wrighting about it) and each bot has an own characteristic ability (like the commands in odd_bot).

I wish valve wasn't going to use these models, they look more like swat team members than they do soldiers.
