(I also posted this in the "Nuclear incoming (for botman" thread)...

I spent 2 hours downloading that MOD and MAN!, that MOD SUCKS.  If you run with "hl.exe -dev" you get to see all the messages about sounds not being precached, sounds sampled at the wrong speed (requiring runtime conversion), model animations that can't play, etc.

They should have spent some more time cleaning that thing up BEFORE they released it.  I'm not sure what the rush was to get it out before these things were cleaned up (did they think people were going to buy it for Christmas?).

I was NOT impressed and if I don't like the initial release of something I almost NEVER go back and look at it again.  I played 2 or 3 maps for a few minutes each and then exited the game an quickly deleted it from my hard drive.

Botman, that is a really narrow attitude and I wish you would re-consider making a bot for Wastelands, or at least adapting one of your existing bots for it.  What if people had looked at the initial release of your bots and said "MAN!, that BOT SUCKS."  It is in beta 2.0b and it obviously has a long way to go. But give credit where credit is due man.  I could really use a bot for Wastelands, and I think a lot of people will turn to you for one in the near future as the mod gains in popularity.

 I think maybe botman was trying to also say that because of all the little bugs they left when they released it, would cause him a headache trying to get the HPB working correctly with it. I think it's kinda like what happened to 1955.. http://www.planethalflife.com/invasion1955/ Whatever the case, he said he had deleted it after seeing such a muss. Also note he said it took him 2 hours to download it,  So i would imagine that he's not gunna download it a second time. (OUCH! Get a CD Burner botman, i downloaded CS, HL1104, AHL, FA & FLF Full Versions & burned them to CD)! Sure Wasteland & alot of other mods are in beta, "which means [i]Some[/i] bugs to expect"! But they could have taken their time to clean it up a bit better. Like botman said, what was the rush to release it for?

A LOT of them did!  I got almost as many e-mails from people saying how bad it sucked as I did from people saying that it was great.  There were even people that sent me e-mail flaming me for posting "faked" screenshots of the bots without even bothering to download the code and try it for themselves.  They "knew" that adding bots to TFC was impossible because everyone said it couldn't be done, therefore I was a LAMER and they were going to get planethalflife to shut my site down.

"Get a CD Burner botman"

I've got one.  What's the use in storing a crappy MOD on a CD?  It's not something I want to keep why would I waste time and space storing it on a CD that I would never use again.  If they release another version of the MOD (with all the bugs fixed and all the problems taken care of) I might download it and try it out.  But they seem like the typical newbie MOD team that can't come up with an original gameplay concept (deathmatch and teamplay have ALREADY been done TO DEATH).  They spend too much time trying to make "really cool" weapons and spend no time trying to get things done properly.

This is only my opinion.  You don't have to agree with me.  I'm not going to discourage anyone else from making a bot for Wasteland if they want to.  If they ask me for help with making a bot for Wasteland, I'll do whatever I can to help, but I'm not going to waste my time on Wasteland.

 no no no.. :o LOL@ & With ya botman.. I downloaded Wasteland when it first came out! And yuck! I deleted it also. I'd never burn that unless they fix it up, But also like you said too, "But they seem like the typical newbie MOD team that can't come up with an original gameplay concept (deathmatch and teamplay have ALREADY been done TO DEATH). " -- I Agree 100%!! hehe.. ;)
Cool! You have a burner also! I only said about the burner after you said it took you 2 hours to download, because it sounds like your like me using a modem to download which means these things can be very time consuming! And to get junk just sucks! I feel that being 56k myself.. :(

Botman, you speaking hard about Wasteland,
it's a young mod with a futur.
Yes it has some bug, yes it has bad map,
But special fonction of weapons are good,
animations are very good, and i enjoy sound.

Only real problem, he don't use last HL 
Fonctionalitys,(Last netcode,last GL rendering,
precaching method...)

but it's not a shit...
