QUOTE:
I haven't been doing much on the HPB bot for the last few weeks.  I was waiting for Front Line Force to release the 1.2 update before another version of the HPB bot would be released.  I didn't
want to release a bot then have to release another version after FLF 1.2 came out because I know that there will be some things in FLF 1.2 that won't work
properly with the existing HPB bot code.  I'm not sure when the next release of the HPB bot will be.  Just keep checking this website every 2 or 3 days to see if there's any update (or just check the news on planethalflife.com)

 Cool!! Good News! I was wondering if you were going to continue with FLF.. :) I figured that i could follow oddbot's version if you hadn't.. 

I had a really good wish, but i can't remember it !?!
*scratch's cranium & thinks*  I hate when then happens..
