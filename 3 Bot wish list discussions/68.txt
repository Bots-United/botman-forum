It has come to my attention that it IS possible to modify the client.dll with mingw32 and compile it.

In order to do it, someone would have to compile a stripped down client.dll in visual c++ 6 with :-

functions to initialise the vgui.
functions to manage the vgui.


Then, in the mingw32 client.dll. you would have to :-

Keep the existing vgui, but for funcs contained in the vgui.lib file, make it  interface with the client.dll compiled in visual c++

This would be possible (as with botmans hpb bot),
but would require someone that was willing to do it.

If your wondering :

The server would check the crc of the client.dll compiled in mingw32, as the one that isn't is only used for funcs in the vgui.lib file.



The visual c++ compiled client.dll would just 
be used to draw the stuff onto the screen, so all the mingw32 client.dll does is tell the visual c++ dll to hurry up and draw things on the screen.
