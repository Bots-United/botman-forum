I have heard that there is a "bot" that can post everything that is beeing said on the CS server directly on to a MIRC channel.
If there is such a "bot" or program were can I get it, have you got one?

I have seen something like this mentioned on Planethalflife.com several months ago.  I suggest you use an Internet search engine (like www.google.com) to search for "mirc bot chat half-life" and see what it comes up with.
