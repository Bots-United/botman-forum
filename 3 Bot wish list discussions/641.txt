I downloaded www.planethalflife.com/frontline/Front Line Force and dam is it sweet!
botman, have you tried it yet? I know that your focusing much of your attention to developing the TFC bots, (And [b]YOU[/b] are doing one hell of a Good Job Too!) [b][i]BUT[/i][/b] maybe there's a slim chance you might do some for FLF? Or do you know of anyone that might be developing a bot for it now?

I posted on their board *fingers crossed* that maybe somebody with C++ Knowledge will take the time.. hehe ;D
I left a link there to ZolcCeli's Bot Tutorial.

Ok!

The statisics of trying to get on to play as of a few seconds ago.

38 servers / 468 players online
My active filter, 
game=frontline, not empty, dedicated server

Even when i checked are not full, it came up with 13 servers. But those dam DSL & Cable people sometimes beat me to it.. hehe ;D
Hope more servers will be added.

I'll try Zack.. Here goes..

Ok, here's the overview
In Front Line Force the players are divided into two teams: Attackers and Defenders. The object for the Attackers is to capture various Capture Points spread throughout the map. The object for the Defenders is to defend those points. Once a point is captured by the Attackers it cannot be taken back. The round is over when either the Attackers capture all the Capture Points or when the round time runs out, in which case the Defenders win. After the round is over, the roles of are switched. If you were previously attacking, you are now defending, and vice versa.

The weapons, player models, and maps are all based on realistic situations, but the damage system and the way the game itself plays is NOT based on realism. Players do NOT die in one or two shots, but rather it takes a few shots from even the strongest gun to kill them, similar to Team Fortress Classic or other traditional multiplayer games. When a player dies, he does NOT sit out the rest of the round like in other games, rather he will respawn after a designated number of seconds has elapsed.

If you goto FLF page on the top click www.planethalflife.com/frontline/features.aspFeatures, it has the Front Line Force Instruction Manual v1.0 .. Which will tell you about the Classes, Weapons & misc. You also get it when you download the mod. 

Ok here's what i can tell ya myself.
You get a total of 8 maps one does look like it's Avanti from TFC .. Ahhh .. But look closely becuase it's not!! ;) Buildings look same that's all.
When you first get into a game you get to choose
1 - For Rebels
2 - For Commandos
5 - Auto Team
6 - Spectate
The next screen then brings up 3 classes to select from. 
1 - Recon Soldier
2 - Assualt Soldier
3 - Support Soldier
And it also tells you how many of each class are currently on your team. There is no class limit as far as i know. Then next screen select your sidearm, you get a choose of 2 pistols.
After you have chosen, next screen is Weapon Catagory.
1 - Shotguns
2 - Sub-Machine Guns
3 - Rifles
4 - Heavy Weapons

Now it's time to play... hehe
In the game you have a time limit till teams change OR the Rebels win. Then each change sides (Like TFC Avanti). The classes look like this,
Rebels have a brownish color
Commandos have a green color
Some maps are kinda dark and it's a little hard to tell who's who. You do have a light up that shows if it's a team member or not though, but even if you do spray them with lead it won't hurt them. Keeping stamina is best when you stick with your team! The more the team works together, the better your stamina and something else can't think? The stamina is not like FireArms!! You only really loose stamina is when you do ALOT of jumping. Also note that the models eye's blink (hehe i was playing and didn't know that.. I thought maybe i was having an LSD flashback.. hehe). And what i haven't seen yet is that when they speak commands you can see their lips move precisly to them.. Alot say the models look that of TF 2, yea somewhat.. Meaning sure the commandos are green like TF 2 but different face's .. They look Really Good!!!!

That's all i can think of.. If that sounds good to you get it.. I think it's Really Nice!! And Note that it is not Beta!! And it's first release!
Go and get it!! Grab a copy of Getright and take your time if your 56k like i am.. Only i played CS with NNBot & some TFC with HPB Bot whilst i was waitin till it was finished downloading.. hehe ;D ;D

Cool!!
I see people asking all over FLF board.. hehe
Can't wait till your first beta comes out! ReDucTor[FGW] ;) 

I think botman's probably to busy answering questions and developing the HPB. OR maybe he downloaded FLF & is now addicted & has stopped all work all together.. LOL!

That's ok. I'm extremely patient since we get are toys for free from these Cool Authors that could  charge money for their addon. And even if they can't charge any money, it's the fact that their still taking time to give us something fun! hehe..

 Nice overview Grubber, but it does sound quite a bit like FireArms, it could be really different, i do not know i haven't played it yet sounds like it might be cool, but i will wait til i get my DSL to download it or if it becomes really popular i will download it

I think FLF is a cross between Cstrike and Firearms. Hey Keola: just download getright then you can download it in 3 days or so.

For those that missed it? This was posted at halflife.net yesterday.
agrobot.aus3d.net/AgroBot

I waypointed a couple maps and mainly since it's first beta there's nothing special yet. Like for instance the bots aren't going to cap anything. But they manuver pretty good around the maps. I don't know about ladders, haven't tried them yet. I believe this is ReDucTor[FGW]'s bot!?
Check it out something to do offline plus you can learn the maps a little better.

I e-mailed Pink and he said "yeah man, do the bot!".  So I've started working on it.  I'll spend the next few days working on it and see what I can release by this weekend (since I have Thursday and Friday off from work for turkey day).

I'm currently making a list of which classes get which weapons, what the ranges and accuracies of the weapons are, etc.  I'll add the code necessary to get them to spawn into the game (after selecting their choice of weapons), adding the round start time stuff (which is stored in the map) and most of the rest should already be working with the HPB bot waypoint code for navigation.

It shouldn't be too difficult to get them to capture a location.  I'll have to work on getting them to handle doors (since they don't really do that at all right now).  I'll also work on getting them to stay together in small groups (of 2 or 3) to provide cover fire for teammates who are capturing a location.

It won't all be available when it first comes out (obviously) but the game rules are more simple than TFC's various modes so that part won't take as long to get working.  Plus it'll give me something else to work on since I get kinda tired of playing with the bots in TFC and Half-Life all the time (I don't even bother with OpFor since it lags so bad).

Bot man, If you are wanting my Weapon Handling Code for Front Line force, i will give it to ya, because my bot would be nothing with out HPB-Bot, so i will give that to you if you want, because that does all the call's and every thing, there is 1077 lines of it, hehe

And agrobot.aus3d.netAgrobot is my bot, I will be releasing a new version soon that will have Full class and weapon handling, bot man would you be able to help me find out how to make bots use the WarmUpTime for Front line force.....

Yeah i think all the bot authors should work together. I say: Lock all the bot authors (Count_Floyd,Botman,Ditlew,Stefan Hendriks.....)in one room with good Pc`s for a year. WOW we will have a good bot then ;-)

You'll need to download the FLF FGD file since the value is contained within the map.

See this thread on a similar discussion for TFC...

No thanks.  I've already got the bots joining the game after randomly choosing a primary and secondary weapon.  It took me a little while to realise that support dudes can't pick a heavyweapon AND a rifle.

I'm using the same generic weapon selection code used in TFC and Half-Life (with arrays of weapon characteristics, firing behaviors and timeouts).

I'll implement the WarmUpTime stuff right after I log out of here.  I'll be working on some waypoint files this afternoon so that they can navigate to the capture points.

After that I'll see if I can get the HPB bot to handle doors properly (which I had started for OpFor but got sidetracked by sentry guns and medics for TFC).

I'm glad to see that Pink used the pEdict->v.team field in the edict to indicate which team the player is on (like in TFC).  It makes is much nicer when looking for enemies and teammates not to have to compare player models plus it allows the MOD developer to change the models without effecting the bot code.

Hey Botman, a quick tip here, players that are not supposed to move on the warmup time use this flag:
pev->flags = FL_WARMUP;

Thats set to all the attackers during the warmup time, as soon as the Warmup time is over, that flag is cleared.

How I prevent movement is set the player speeds to 1, and when the warmup time is back, I set it back up again.

Hope this helps.

Oh, okay, good tip.  I was just catching the "You are Attacking" or "You are Defending" to determine which players are attackers and which players are defenders.

I did get the WarmUp time thing to work by catching the client WarmUp messages (which seem to get sent to all players (MSG_ALL) at the end of the warmup time (with a 0 to indicate it's off) and sent to individual players (MSG_ONE) with a 1 to indicate they need to pause until they receive the warmup with a 0.  That seems to work pretty well also.  I'll modify things so that they pivot around a little bit while frozen so that they don't look like they fell asleep!  :)

Well, all players get the Warmup time banner on top, but only the attackers are the ones that can't move, I would check the FL_WARMUP flag to determine who cans and can't move. The flag is only set to the attackers.

seems like this post has kind of turned into a bot developers questions, but....
I was talking with ReDucTor last night about how to tell who's attacking and who's defending.  You said you used to intercept the HUD message, but now you use the flag FL_WARMUP, right?
so, would you access it with a test like 
if(pBot->v.flags== FL_WARMUP) ?  
We were also wondering what else you have to add to the code (like #define stuff) and do we have to intialize the FL_WARMUP flag or does FLF somehow do that itself?  thanks for the help

I'm not using the FL_WARMUP bit flag (since I don't know the value of that flag!).

I'm still intercepting the WarmUp message (the RegUserMsg one).  It gets sent to the players that need to freeze with a 1 using MSG_ONE.  It gets sent again when the warmup time is over to all players with a 0 using MSG_ALL (the edict is NULL for MSG_ALL messages so you can't compare that to the bot's edict like the other network messages are doing).

The warm up thing works pretty well that way.  I haven't had any problems with it.  I added in some code that makes then pivot randomly left and right while they are paused so it doesn't look like they are completely frozen.
