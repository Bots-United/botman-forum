Hey Botman!
I have a couple wishes for you,now now,I'm not 
rushing you,so don't get pissed at me :)

(1)For TFC could you get the medic bot to come
   and heal you when you call them.

(2)PLEASE! Reduce the level (Skill) of the 
   snipers.

(3) And last but not least can you get the
    other engineer bots to build Sentery Guns
    and dispensers.

Remember don't get in such a rage :)

"(1)For TFC could you get the medic bot to come and heal you when you call them."

Yes, I had planned to add that before I started working on the Front Line Force additions.  It's at the top of the list of upcoming features.

"(2)PLEASE! Reduce the level (Skill) of the snipers."

Yes, a more realistic aiming feature will be added also.  It's near the top of the list.

"(3) And last but not least can you get the other engineer bots to build Sentery Guns and dispensers."

Getting engineers to build sentry guns and dispensers is also on the list (although not real near the top).  Further down on the list is getting bots to not recognized disguised spies or spies feigning death (but I don't consider those features REALLY essential to playing the game).

Bots NEED to know how to capture and return the flag.  Bots NEED to know how to use the weapons (grenades will be added soon too).  Bots NEED to know how to deal with things in the maps like water, ladders, and elevators.

What I consider more important that hasn't been added yet is getting bots to go find health and ammo when they are running low.  Also bots need to know when they should run from a fight instead of ALWAYS engaging in combat.  These things are MUCH more important in playing the game than being able to build a dispenser or feigning death.

Yep Botman is right (again!) you have to improve the navigation first before you can add any of those "Extra features"

And sorry for the stars thread, it was just a joke :-)

Is there any way to let all the bots know different ways to goto the flag or capture point? It will be a bit repetitive if all the bots walk the same way all the time to get to a flag or capture point as the bots only know the "shortest" way to get to the flag.

Also Could the introduction of a wayopoint radius or something like that get added into the hpb_bot, just like the great podbot? ;)

"Is there any way to let all the bots know different ways to goto the flag or capture point?"

Nope.  One of the big disadvantages of using Floyd's algorithm is that all the paths are pre-calculated.  The bot will always take the shortest path to the goal.  The shortest path is always the same from a given point to any other given point (i.e. they will always take the same path).  I don't have any plans to change this behavior in the near future as this is a VERY complex thing to change.

"Also Could the introduction of a wayopoint radius or something like that get added into the hpb_bot, just like the great podbot?"

What would the waypoint radius be used for?  If you are navigating from waypoint to waypoint a larger radius would only change how close the bot needs to be to a waypoint before it is considered to be "touching" it.  The tolerances for the distance from the waypoint could be modified (they are hard coded currently), but I believe that all this would do is make them navigate more poorly as they would have trouble getting through doors or other narrow spaces that require tighter tolerances.  I suppose you could modify the waypoint code so that as you placed each waypoint you could manually indicate what tolerance (radius) is associated with this waypoint.  Waypoints that require tighter tolerance would have it and waypoints that didn't require tight tolerances (like out in open spaces) would have that as well.  That would lead to a little more "random" looking path finding, although they would still go the same way from point A to point B, they would just vary the locations along the way slightly on different trips.

This is not so complicated as trying to vary the path from Floyd's algorithm, but it would be fairly tedious for the waypoint creator to have to specify a radius for each waypoint as it was placed.  I don't plan on adding anything like this to the HPB bot anytime in the near future either.
