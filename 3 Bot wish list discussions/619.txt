when are you going to make the bots build sgs?? what are you working on making the bots do now? if you got bots to build sgs then making bots disguise as a spy would come with it too.

I think the only thing you need to do is send a

build x

command to the server(where x is a number)

I think its something like that... you could also shoot a traceline out from the bot to check for space + see if the sg is being built.
