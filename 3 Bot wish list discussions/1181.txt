I was wondering what your plans are for the class specific waypoints. I know you already have a sniper one and will soon have engy one. I was curious if you have plans to add for other classes as well? 

I thought it would be nice to have a waypoint that instructs hw's to gaurd or defend at. This would compliment the engy spots once you get the sg thing working. Then you could put a hw or soldier waypoint next to the sg waypoints. I find a team of hw and engy or soldier and engy to make a great defense. Surely you've already thought of this but perhaps a demoman waypoint for the detpack?

Sorry, I know there are a million and one things you still want/need to do to the bot code, I just thought this might be easy to include in one of the next couple releases considering you've got it working for snipers.

Also, was wondering if the logo/spray thing is implemented in 4.2a? If so what directory do I need to add to make the bots start spaming the server with graphics?

Last I just have to say that this bot is progressing quite nicely. The addition of grenades really made an improvement. The real players on my server are begging me to take the hwbots off the server :) I also notice less use of the crowbar, did you change the way they decide what weapon to use?

Class specific waypoints aren't that hard to add to the code.  They just take up bits in the 32 bit waypoint flag field (only about 14 of these 32 bits are currently used).  The problem is what do these waypoints mean?  Do you want the bots to always pick one of the points that matches it's class and head towards it?  You could get a bot to guard an area by doing so (just have a few points close together with that class flag set).  But what if you have 3 or 4 such areas spread all over the map?  The bots will randomly pick a point and head towards it, when it reaches it, it will randomly pick another point and head towards it.  However the second point that gets picked might be all the way on the other side of the map instead of near the first point that it picked.  Is this the behavior that you want?  Do you ever want the bots to stray from points that match their class (i.e. do you only want the scout to be able to pick up and carry flags or can any class do that whenever they "feel" like it?).

I'm not sure I have a real good feeling for what a "medic" waypoint does.  I'm not sure I have a good feeling for what some of the other class specific waypoints would do.  Sniper waypoints make sense.  Spy waypoints might be good places to feign death.  HWguy waypoints would be good places to camp with the AC cannon to guard the flag (assuming the flag is still actually at the capture point and not somewhere else).  What would be the purpose of some of the other class specific waypoints?

The custom spray logos have not been added to the HPB bot yet.  Because of the way logos get loaded and precached by the server, I will have to create a small utility to allow you to set up which logos will be used by the bots.  I was going to have the bot code randomly select logos are startup time, but the logos have already been precached by the server at the time the bot code starts and you would be forced to exit the server and restart in order to get the bot logos working.  I figured if I created a little utility to allow you to specify which logos you wanted (and which color you wanted for monochrome logos), it would be a little more user friendly in getting the bots to use the logos you want them to.

They still use the crowbar as much as they used to as long as they get close enough to the enemy.  With the grenade throwing they tend to stay a little further away since they are backing up after throwing a grenade or backing up when they see an enemies thrown grenade.

I hadn't thought of all the classes but I don't feel all classes get a waypoint for their class. Scouts dont and neither do medics as far as I can see. I guess I imagined that there could be multiple waypoints for a certain class. How else would you get the engy to build his gun in different spots. If he builds in the same spot all the time then it's too predictable. Would it be possible to make an sg be a waypoint in a sense? That way a hwguy or soldier would go to whereever the engy chose to defend at? Perhaps thats a solution? As far as Demo's go they might need 2 types, detpack and pipetrap. 

And of course the person who creates the waypoint will still have some freedom to make choices. If they want heavy weapon guys to cap flags then don't make a defend waypoint. Or perhaps allow a variable where the user (me for example) could set a percentage as to how often they go to the defend waypoint or just act as they do now (going after the flag?).

How do flag waypoints work now? In other words what makes a sniper go to sniper waypoint instead of flag waypoint? 

I realize there are lots of questions of how this would work. I'm just trying to explain how I invision this would work. Keep in mind that my use of the hpb_bot is different than most. I have 8 real players to support the bots. There's only 2 bots per team. 

I just think it would be great to come into 2forts flag room to find a well placed sentry that is guarded by both the engy that built it as well as either a hwguy/soldier/demoman. *THAT* would be the cats meow.

btw, how do you plan to set up the engy waypoints. I was thinking/hoping it's like the snipers so you can specify a direction that the sg should face.

Class specific waypoints:

Sniper - obviously a sniping spot
hwguy - defend point
demoman - detpack spot(s) and pipetrap defend
spy - feign death
soldier - defend point
engy - place sg point and place dispenser point

Thats all I can think of but surely someone else will have a different view.

Is there perhaps a way to make a waypoint that is the Camp or Defend waypoint that you could then select what class or classes would stop at it via the menu? 

Personally I wouldn't have pyro's defend as their a rather quick class but obviously others could feel different. This way might be a better solution for everyone.

Still think that the ability for the bots to find friendly sg's and help defend at that point would be really cool too.

Sorry, guess I am just really looking forward to the new engy/sg code.

It would be cool if the hw's had camping waypoints, maybe you could do like the foxbot and have sg/defense waypoints that could be used for either a camper or work as a spot for sg's.  I know nothing of coding so i don't know how hard this would be but maybe if you designated a few classes as mainly defensive, say hw's,  demos. and some soldiers, i dunno going by some kind of percentage somehow, so that they would still also be able to attack sometimes as well.  Or maybe make it an option in the config, as to whether the bot is offensive or defensive,by either a 0 or 1 

like this

addbot 1 6 frodo 1 0

the last number there the 0 would mean that he plays D

and if you wanted him to be an offensive player you could just make it a 1 instead.  I don't know if these suggestions are naive or not, i know nothing of coding, i am a caveman your world amazes and frightens me.
