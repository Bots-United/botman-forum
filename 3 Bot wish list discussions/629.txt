I've gotten side tracked working on some other stuff.  It'll probably be the weekend after Thanksgiving before another HPB bot is released.

Fixing problems with the map specific bot.cfg file stuff.  Making the medic pay attention to players calling for a medic (and making bots call for a medic when they need on and see one).

Maybe some other stuff, but I'm not sure what yet.  Probably not building sentry guns or dispensers.

Thanksgiving is Thursday, November 23rd.  It's the day when all us Yanks sit around eating turkey, watching football and drinking beer.
