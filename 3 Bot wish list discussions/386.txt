First, you have a great bot!
and Second, my suggestion:
You should make the bots be either defence bot or offence bot. Everytime a bot spawn, it will check how many bots in his team are in deffence and how many in offence. If he's the first to spawn, it will go to offence. The next one will see that there is someone at offence but none at deffence, hw will go deffence. I think this will make your bot much more realistic, cause in real TFC games (well, most of, there are lamers) not everyine is going to get the flag. And if they do, the lose!
I think you should use this suggestion, with a bit of changes if you'd like, of course.
Thanks,
   Ben

I think that they should have like 1/5th of their members on defense and if they start getting their flag stolen then more people should join defense.

I have to admit, thats a great idea. I hope Botman reads this post.

I read all the posts, I just don't respond to all of them.

Certain classes in TFC should take on certain rolls (offense/defense), but they shouldn't be limited to ALWAYS having those rolls.

People complain that the snipers should NEVER leave the sniper points in maps.  Well obviously if you were playing against just 1 bot and it was a sniper, guess what?  It would NEVER capture the flag!

I plan to eventually have a configuration file that indicates what percentage of classes should be chosen when bots are spawned (10% scouts, 10% snipers, 30% soldiers, 20% HWguy, etc.).  You will be able to modify the percentage to whatever you like.  I may make things so that you can specify different percentages for different maps.

Once a bot chooses a class, there will be an offensive or defensive roll that the bot will primarily play, but it WILL occasionally take on the opposite roll.  HWguys will occasionally try to capture the flag, but they will usually just guard the fort.

If you don't allow them to do things randomly, it gets very boring VERY quickly.  But something like this feature won't be implemented for quite a while, so don't hold your breath waiting for it to be in the next release or the one after that.  It won't be.  I don't consider this an urgent feature and it certainly isn't a bug fix.

I will work on fixing the things that are "broken" (i.e. cause problems with the game and/or crashes) first.  I will fix things that REALLY need to work properly to get the bots to be able to play other types of maps (i.e. reverse capture the flag, not shooting allies, etc.).  Then I'll work on adding new features (like limited use of special skills, more random navigation between goals, supporting a sequence of events using waypoints (press button, go through door), etc.).
