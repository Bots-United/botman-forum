I had no problems too! Maybe you haven`t tried all servers?

A couple of solutions u can try.

1. Shift+click on the link

2. Drag the download link into the box next to the status bar (it almost always works for me).

3. Or instead of using fileplanet, go to www.fileleech.com. They probably have it there and they are MUCH more reliable than Fileplanet.

Yes, if you are going to the "Download" web page then you should look on the "HPB bot" web page instead.  There are alternate links there...
