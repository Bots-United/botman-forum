If you make improvements such as real spies, medic healing, SG's, grenades, strafing, etc... PLEASE streamline your code to be CPU friendly.  I just tried Abot on my P2 400 (not my dedicated server).  GOOD GOD.  My framerates went from fine with 12+ HPB bots to pretty damn horrible with 6 Abot bots. I need more than 6 opposing bots at 1 difficulty (and unbalanced teams) to be remotely challenging solo, even with Abot-quality AI.

That said, I'm looking forward to your improvements botman! You rock!!

I do try to be CPU efficient when creating my bot code.  I know it's not much fun to only be able to play with 3 or 4 bots in a level.  You spend most of your time wandering around trying to find the little buggers.

Some things that bot developers should be aware of it using too many TraceLines to look for entities or to aid in navigation.  Also having inefficient loops to search things (like waypoints) can cause lots of CPU usage.  Also, things that are on a timer shouldn't be checked too frequently (don't check something every 1/10th of a second if you can get by with checking it every second instead).

Also I have access to a couple of different machines.  One is a 300Mhz pentium, the other is a 166 Mhz pentium.  I can tell pretty quickly on the 166 Mhz machine when the CPU is getting bogged down too much.  If a developer is using a 500 Mhz or faster machine then they can't really judge how well things will work on slower machines.

hi

i'd noticed that too , and make some tests....

system

celeron 300A (oc 433)
200 Mo RAM (pc100)
OS : WINDOWS 98SE

phineas VS jumbot 

phineas 0.22 : 14 bots   CPU ~82%
jumbot  2.4  :  7 bots   CPU ~86%

WINNER : Phineas
**************************************

HPB bots VS ODDbot

HPB bots 4.1a : 14 bots  CPU ~66 %

ODDbot   1.2  : 14 bots  CPU ~85 %

WINNER : HPB Bots
***********************************

Just a note :

OS windows2000

HPB bots 4.1 : 14 bots   CPU ~19 %         !!!!!


the command line with gamehost on NT is the less CPU comsumer i' ever seen

so you are saying that 4.1 eats that much less cpu then 4.1a?, thats wild. I have win2k also, i am going to try some tests too, you have me curious.

I think he's saying the HPB bot 4.1 on Windows 2000 only uses 19%, but on Windows 98 SE it uses 66%.

Well I just got an Athlon 1 GHz with 256Mb RAM, I bet when I release my bot everyone will say

"Hey!! I've only got 1 bot in and it's using 98% of my resources!!!!!! This is crap!!"

Does anyone know if the dedicated server runs on reactos (www.reactos.com)?
