Botman, is it possible for you to make the waypoint for levels like the waypoints for the NNBot.  In his waypoints the bots know directly which way they need or want to go, like hostges, camping points and HRZs.  I know that his bot is based on your code so surely you can make the bots work like this.  By the way, i'm not knocking the current bot waypoint system, i just think it would be better like this.

Yes, the HPB bot already does support that (for TFC maps).  If you tag a waypoint as a "flag location" or "flag capture point".  The bots will know the shortest route from their current position to the flag or capture point.  You could also tag waypoint in CS as "flag" or "capture" waypoints, but the HPB bot doesn't know how to USE the hostage, so creating a "flag" waypoint in CS is pointless.

If I ever decide to add more support for Counter-Strike to the HPB bot, they will be able to use hostages, buy weapons, plant/defuse bombs, etc., but right now the HPB bot doesn't know how to do ANY of those things.  As I mentioned before, I need to fix features that are not working properly in the HPB bot before I add more features since those new features will probably add additional problems.
