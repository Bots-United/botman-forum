I think in games like Quake 3 that the bots "like" certain weapons.  You could probably set it up for each bot in the bot name file which weapon the prefer or what class they prefer, etc.
Also, in Jumbot there is a "Realistic Server" setting, where the bots join and leave and jump to different teams to even them out, etc.  I thought that was pretty cool...
