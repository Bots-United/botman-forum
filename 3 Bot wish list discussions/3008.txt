Subject: HPB as a Metamod plugin ?

Why wouldn't you release a version of your HPB bot source code as a Metamod plugin ? It should be quite straightforward for a l33t coder like you ;-) and I think it shouldn't require much work on your own because you've diven much more far in understanding the SDK than many others. But foremost it would be a great help for bot authors because Metamod's coding pages are not so easy to understand and their example plugin is so stripped and so minimal it makes it difficult to figure out how to implement more complex metamod plugins (I think...)

There's an example of converting the HPB bot to a metamod plugin on the metamod website...

Oops sorry, I wasn't aware of it, thank you!

Pierre-Marie Baty -

I noticed that you have a metamod port posted on your site.  It appears to be based on 2.x HPB code.

Any chance of getting that re-compiled/tested with 3.x HPB code?

This is actually the HPB_bot 3.0, except that it wasn't botman who updated the source code, but myself.

The only difference with 3.0 and its previous version (2.1) is a fix in the GetGameDir() function to prevent the game to crash because of the new behavior of the engine in this function. It was a simple fix, and I didn't want to re-download again the 3.0 source code and do the port again, instead I updated this version with the changes, the only thing is that I forgot to bump the version number (which is still 2.1).

You can use it safely, it's exactly the same as the 3.0.

I'm running:
HL Version: 4.1.1.1d beta
Metamod Installed: 1.16.2.0
Admin Mod Installed: 2.50.56.0
Cheating-Death (C-D) Server v4.5.0


I installed it to use with my dedicated server & have the following files in my TFC folder:
HPB_bot_names.txt
HPB_bot_logo.cfg
HPB_bot_chat.txt
HPB_bot.cfg

I deleted ALL my mapname_HPB_bot.cfg files & i am only useing the HPB_bot.cfg
In it i have:
min_bots 0
max_bots 10

My server has "maxplayers 24"..
But the min/max thing is not working. The bots fill the server & then occasionally a bot will leave & a new 1 will take it's place. Do you know why it does this? Should be just 10 bots that join & as humans join a bot should leave.

Here's my stuff:

I tried botman's v3.0 with max/min set, it worked. Bots stopped at 10.

It see's the min/max setting.

Notice you might have to edit the pfnGetPlayerAuthId function in the HPB_bot mm plugin code, as it returns a local "0" string, you should define a constant string called BOT_AUTH_ID say and make it "BOT" or something, that could cause problems with steam.

Also, grubber,

"min_bots set to 0 
max_bots set to 10 "

Min bots must be set to -1 I think for bots to join properly.. Im not sure if they will refill the server when another space is free.

No, "min_bots 0", "max_bots 10" should be valid.

This means, the minimum number of bots+players should be no less than 0 (if there aren't any players, there doesn't need to be any bots) and the maximum number of bots + players should be no more than 10 (don't add any bots if there are at least 10 players on the server).

If you set "min_bots 0", bots should get kicked whenever a human player joins the server (unless there would be less than min number of bots remaining).

I wonder if you have the min_bots and max_bots specified AND you also have map specific "addbot" commands.  This might cause problems if you do.  In this case, ONLY use the "addbot" command in the map specific .cfg files and don't set any "min_bots" or "max_bots" value.

Doh. Understood why.

In bot.cpp, in the BotCreate() function, add this just before the MDLL_ClientPutInServer() call:
code:

      // HPB_bot metamod fix - START

      // we have to do the ClientPutInServer() hook's job ourselves since calling the MDLL_
      // function calls directly the gamedll one, and not ours. You are allowed to call this
      // an "awful hack".

      while ((i < 32) && (clients[i] != NULL))
         i++;

      if (i < 32)
         clients[i] = BotEnt;  // store this clients edict in the clients array

      // HPB_bot metamod fix - END



I updated the file on my site. It's fixed (and it reports 3.0 now).

I did try that before reading botman's post below & when server started it showed "min_bots 1". About the -1, maybe you were thinking about FoxBot? FoxBot uses the -1.. :)

I did at 1st in the "HPB_bot.cfg", but cleaned it out thinking that was the problem when useing (Pierre-Marie Baty's HPB_bot plugin). So i tried your HPB_bot.dll v3.0 with same settings & i had no problems. But when humans leave & join "of course they would rather be on the team with MORE .. heh.." So i think maybe i better make some "Mapname_HPB.cfg" files. 8) Even though i do like that somewhat, it's a challenge.[/quote]
