I wish there was a bot cam, for us waypoint makers to see how the bot behaves on the map... =P

Just turn on observer mode (or botdontshoot) and follow them around the map.

Use "observer 1" (without the quotes) to turn on observer mode.

Use "botdontshoot 1" (without the quotes) to turn on botdontshoot mode.

These can be turned off by using 0 instead of 1 in the above commands.

I already knew that, but thanx anyway.
Using a botcam it would be more easy to find where the bots get stuck, or if they're doing the right things, pickin up the guns.
