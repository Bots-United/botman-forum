Your bot is by far the best bot for TFC I have seen. I dont know how many people have played the CTFBot for origional quake but in my opinion that bot was the most configurable one i have played with. As a suggestion to you, adding admin commands (such as moving bots to different teams etc.) would make you stand out from the rest. Just take a look at that bot for some ideas, or if anyone else that has played with that bot can give suggestions. Keep it up Botman!

yes, much fun, admin stuff, the feel of power, the moronic feeling that your only controlling bots that don't know better.
