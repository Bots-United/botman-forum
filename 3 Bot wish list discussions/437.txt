hehe, well i stumbled upon one..

Murderous_thugs
ip - 160.79.71.53:27015

Get there easy, use filter and search for 2fort. 

Rules say to stay on blue team, but i seen some go to red. Red is the team of bots! Mostly snipers and a couple meds.. LOL!! It's pretty cool.. Something different..

Found out it's a brother thing.. hehe 
Cool bro's to bring us bot's with humans online!
So here's the other bro's server:
Plays Badlands,
63.226.16.218:11979

AND here's an ip to yet another that was givin:
38.185.98.99:27016

Thx bro's for the cool entertainment with the bots!!

Essshhh,, i know my spelling is off a little but it's cuz my cousin Mr. Al Coholic is in town today.. :D
