Hey Guys have you ever played Codename: Eagle and what do you think of it. (Just asking because NOBODY ANYWHERE knows this (since V 1.33) great game, but me and my friends are often playing it(LAN))

Hm, and what does this have to do with Half-Life or bots?

J/K

I dont know much about that game, I did play it once though and to tell you the truth I found it to seriously suck.
