I'm working on Jumbot2HPBBot Waypoint converter and I wish you could make new file-flag that would work like this..
if flag is on then HPB would automaticly do "waypoint update" then set flag off and then do "waypoint save"

"Jumbot waypoint -> HPB waypoint" fileconverter..
fileurl:
http://koti.mbnet.fi/axh/files/Jum2HPB.zip

Files made by Jum2HPB don't have item/weapon/armor-info.. so first time you use converted file you would have do "waypoint update" and "waypoint save" manually..

What I was hoping for is that there would be new file flag (like #define F_FL_AUTOUPDATE (1<<5)) so that ..

if "header.waypoint_file_flags & F_FL_AUTOUPDATE"
HPBBot would do 

 "waypoint update" 
  and 
 "waypoint save" 

automaticly.

The only thing the waypoint update command will do is to go through each waypoint one by one and search for nearby health, armor, ammo, or weapons.  Does The Jumbot waypoint .jrf files not contain this information?

You could probably just make a script with "waypoint update; waypoint save" in it and bind that to a key to update the maps after you have converted them.
