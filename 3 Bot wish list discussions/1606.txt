Botman, can you make the bot cheats?

Sure, but don't you get REALLY tired of people cheating on Internet servers?  Why would you want bots to cheat as well?  Sure it would be kinda neat the first few times but I imagine it would get really frustrating for the bots to be constantly cheating.  The bots can cheat in ways that a human player never could.

Yeah, and they can already see though doors.  Can they see through func_wall's?

Can you make the bot with the flag defend themselves sometimes?  I remember you had changed it so that they would some of the time, but mine don't ever seem to shoot when they have the flag.

TFC bots that are carring the flag will occasionally attack an enemy (every 5 seconds it will check for enemies and 40% of the time it will attack an enemy if it sees one).

Until I can modify the combat code so that bots continue to follow waypoints toward a goal (the capture point) even when enaged in combat, you'll have to live with the existing problems.

I do have plans to eventually change this so that bots carrying the flag will both attack enemies AND continue to follow waypoint paths toward a goal.  I just haven't been able to find the time to implement these changes yet.
