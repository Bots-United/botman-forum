hey botman--
(Ur my idle :D) Just one little thing I found to be annoying. I downloaded the source of the HPB bot had some fun with it then went to put it on a server but didnt have the configs. I Think it would make peoples lives a little easier if you could include the configs in the source. If Im wrong about anything sorry...
