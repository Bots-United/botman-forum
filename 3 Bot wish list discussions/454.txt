--------------------------------------------------
Here are some ideas I thought of regarding this bot (or actually all bots) for TFC, in no particular order. Some of these ideas might have been mentioned before though, and in that case: sorry for posting them again :)
Some of these ideas might also be way too hard to ever even dream of coding while others might already be there. And as I said these are only ideas, and if a bot will ever have them all implemented it would indeed be perfect.
This will be pretty long btw, but I hope it's ok :)



General AI stuff:

- Make the bot try to calculate ABOUT how much health the enemy he's fighting has left (at least on high skill) so that he'll finish him off with shotgun for example (or even crowbar if standing close :). And a sniper could perhaps finish an enemy off with automatic rifle. The bot will quick forget about its calculation though, as soon as the enemy disappears from his field of view or if the enemy is healed by medic/engineer.

- Make bots switch weapons according to what distance their enemies are at, so that if a medic runs past a soldier and he doesn't have time to fire a rocket until the medic is far away he could try to shoot him a bit with the shotgun. And a sniper could use automatic rifle when and an enemy attacks him too close (especially against spy/medic).

- Make the bot use the crowbar much less. Even though it is pretty strong most other secondary weapons (shotguns etc) are stronger. And the primary weapons are usually strongest.

- Make the bot use different duel tactics so that a demoman/soldier will try to keep a good distance as they'll otherwise be hit by the splash damage of their own rockets/pipes, while a scout would just try to run past with perhaps a few nailgun shots.

- Make bots use different tactics against different enemies (i.e. run around corners and hide now and then when fighting hwguys).

- Learn bots how to dodge rockets, nails and grenades and also how to circle and run around and dodge in duels.

- Make some bots (not all classes and not in every situation ;) retreat when low on health or out of ammo. Defending bots or bots close to respawn would retreat back to respawn while offensive bots would try to reach the flag instead (which they should always try to, even in a duel).

- Learn bots to consider if he can win a fight. If a soldier sees a medic and is on pretty low health he might still try to attack it, but if he sees a hwguy he would run for it.

- Make bots aim with rocket launcher and nail-type of guns so that he'll aim in front of where you are running and not head on (especially with rocket launcher). Same goes for most grenades. The bot needs to know how much in front it needs to aim and will therefore have to include both speed of enemy (and himself), distance and lots of other stuff in its calculations. Also make bots fire rockets on floor at enemy and not head on.

- Learn bots how to defend and how to refill in respawn frequently.

- Learn bots how to kill sentry guns, both with the hwguy head-on style or the grenade style, or even the scout hide-behind-corner-and-shoot style :)

- Make bots report (i.e. "[DEF] 2 Incoming Enemy Scouts at Entrance!", "[OFF] Enemy flag at Spiral!" or "I'm out of rockets!" etc), using a text-file linked together with the waypoint file that tells what each place on the map is called using waypoints, so that they know the "name" of every place of the map. A number would also specify which team this place is for. (Example: waypoint 64 = "Ramp Room", 1).

- Make bots listen to reports, and even to reports or orders given by player. Perhaps make a text file in which the player decides what phrases said by the player the bot should listen to.

- Make bots call for medic (using "saveme" command) when low on health/armor or infected, hallucinated, and when standing close to a medic/engineer. Also make them wait to be healed until the medic/engineer either goes away or does nothing.

- Make engineers and medics react on the "saveme" command used both by bots and players, and make them run and heal them at once.

- Make bots play worse when conced (walk dizzy and hit less), and make them confused when hallucinated (make them fire at nothing etc).

- Learn bots how to discard (except engineers) and pick up dropped backpacks. Also make bots discard when they run past a friendly sentry.

- Make bots tell eachother what they will be playing so that they can autimatically balance the team between off and def.


Spy:

- Make spy discuise and use skins based on what classes they've seen the enemy team use (and never discuise as scout ;)

- Make enemies react (i.e. figure out it is a spy) and even report when they see the player/bot change skin.

- Learn spies how to backstab, both in a duel (after slowing them down) and when disguised.

- Make spies engage in combat as little as possible (except some backstabs here and there) when disguised.

- Learn spies how to feign (even time it right ;) if hunted by too hard or too many enemies with too little health.

- Make all spies kill sentry guns they see when disguised with grenades.

- Give spies different personalities so that some will be assassins while others would go directly for flag.

- Perhaps make some of the spies go to the enemy team's "sniper spots" and perhaps even camp with a silent feign and wait for victims to arrive.

- Make spies act different according to what class they are discuised as. If they discuise as medic they could run around with knife as it would look normal but when discuised as soldier they need to use a gun. If discuised as sniper they would most likely go directly to the sniper spots as it would otherwise look pretty suspicious.

- Learn bots to watch their own team's classes so that they know what different classes the team is using, and can therefore understand if they meet an enemy spy discuised as one that doesn't exist.

- Learn bots how to make a spy-check, both fire at incoming friendlies as they could be spies, and shoot with shotgun/crowbar to show they're not spies themselves.


Other classes:

- Make medic heal/infect.

- Learn medic and scout how to "conc away" enemies. Especially if confronting many enemies at ones, snipers aiming at you or big, strong hwguy standing at flag defending it.

- Make demoman switch between pipes and normal grenades so that he will use normal only when at close distant and will otherwise use pipe-detonate techniques, especially in duels.

- Learn demoman how to use pipes for defense and lay them out and wait for enemies to come.

- Make demoman set detpacks.

- Learn engineer how to throw EMP grenades, and what classes they should throw it at.

- Learn soldier and hwguy/demoman how to throw nail grenade and MIRVS so that they'll use it when retreating, or at groups of enemies (or at respawn if they know where it is :).


Waypoint files:

- Make "sentry spots" in waypoint files where the bots will try to build sentry guns (these will have to be team-specific).

- Make "rocket-jump spots", "conc-jump spots" and "pipe-jump spots" where the bot will try to rocket-/conc-/pipejump upwards in the direction the spot is facing (this will probably have to be much more complex than this though).

- Make "defense spot" that bots will defend (if you place one in RR in 2fort for example, the bot will know that that room is important to defend).

- Make someother kind of "defense spot" that will be used instead of the ordinary ones when flag is stolen.

- Make ammo, grenade, armor and health spots so that the bot only takes the grenade bag when it needs more grenades. Otherwise it would do its best to avoid it, while snipers would never pick them up.




Thanks for reading and I'm sure I'll think of more ideas later. Please comment if you don't agree with me or if you have something else to say :)

how long did that take you to write?

You need to use the word "teach" instead of learn. Also half the crap you listed was stuff that would be really hard to near impossible to put in (- Learn bots to watch their own team's classes so that they know what different classes the team is using, and can therefore understand if they meet an enemy spy discuised as one that doesn't exist. ; - Learn bots how to kill sentry guns, both with the hwguy head-on style or the grenade style, or even the scout hide-behind-corner-and-shoot style ; - Learn engineer how to throw EMP grenades, and what classes they should throw it at.) just for a few examples.

You don't want to know ;)

Sorry, I forgot to say that there would probably be lots of english errors as I'm not from an english speaking country myself.

I know what you mean by "impossible", that's why I said this in the beginning:
"Some of these ideas might also be way too hard to ever even dream of coding while others might already be there. And as I said these are only ideas, and if a bot will ever have them all implemented it would indeed be perfect."
And as the boards name is "Wish List" I thought I would post even the "impossible" ones. And you never told me why you thought they were "crap" so please do as I've no idea why you think so.

Those three you mentioned as examples btw wouldn't be impossible to code, if that's what you meant when posting them as examples.
