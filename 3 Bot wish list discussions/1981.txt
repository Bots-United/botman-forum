Ok it might be impossible or something, but here goes (from a non coders point of view :D)
Having played about with this bot and other bots one thing i have noticed is that the bots cant defend, or at other times just dont defend.
Would it be possible to change the addbot command line to something like...

addbot 1 3 defend
or
addbot 1 5 attack

or something like that so you bot coder peeps could get closer to that 'all round game with bots' ?

Just an idea, u have made them good so far (except their waypoint following skillz are a little offy :)) but apart from that they are cewl :D

Sure, you could specify which bots would be offensive and go seek out goals and which bots would be defensive and hang around the home base guarding stuff.

There are bots for Half-Life MODs that do this already.

You could make the assumption that certain classes (like HWGuys in TFC) would always be defensive and others (like Scouts in TFC) would always be offensive.

I'm more of a deathmatch player and the HPB bot's behaviour reflects that game style.  I think it's kind of fun to see a sniper or HWGuy go for the flag every once in while.

P.S. If you had only defensive bots on both teams, guess how many times the flag would get captured?  None (at least not by bots anyway).

Maybe I need to add that to the bot_chat.txt file.

aye but u wouldnt do that would ya :D

The problem with most bots out at the moment is they either:
Mong around in the respawn
Get stuck just outside the respawn
Deathmatch on the bridge

Either way (imo) end up for pretty p00r gameplay. TFC is a game about capturing the flag, and in clan games you always have offence and defence.
Im sure loads of peeps like DM, and if they like that they have Half Life and DMC......TFC is capping the flag :)
