I am running a HLDM server and when I start the game (teamplay) I get Bots that are all Gina model and they won't shoot anybody.  I've seen other threads that said that the mp_teamlist in the server.cfg file can not be "" or contain more than 6 models...., my mp_teamlist contains exactly 6 models and they are all valid.
I also read another post that said to turn teamplay off, which I did, and that seems to solve the problem however, I run a teamplay server so teamplay off is not an option.
I've checked everything I can check and I think I've set it up exactly as directed.  Any ideas?

BTW, your Bots are great.

Try chaning the mp_teamlist to 5 player models and see if that fixes the problem.

I haven't tested any of this myself, so I'm only going on what other people have reported.

Don't put mp_teamlist in your server.cfg.

CReate a file called 

game.cfg

in your server's \valve folder

put the

mp_teamlist "..."
mp_teamplay 1301

variables in it

and it should work..take them out of server.cfg

I tried changing teamlist to 5 but that didn't work.

The moving of the teamlist and teamplay variables to the new cfg file named game did work well.

Thank you both for your help.

I love these Bots, lol.
