Whenever I play counterstrike vs. the HPB bot the game sometimes crashes and says an error accured in HL.exe, does anyone know how to solve this or is anybody else having this problem also?

I currently have HL version 1.1.1.0 and CS version 1.4 installed, also I noticed something strange, I installed CS version 1.5, but whenever I install HPB bot, it automatically turns CS 1.5 into CS 1.4!!!! what the (****) is going on?

The HPB bot install batch file copies the liblist.gam file from the HPB_bot\cstrike folder (which has 1.4 as the CS version number).

Just edit the Half-Life\cstrike\liblist.gam file with any text editor and change 1.4 to 1.5 if that bothers you.

For the crashing problem, try running Dr. Watson (usually found in the Windows folder, drwatson.exe) before starting the game.  When it crashes, Dr. Watson will create a log file with the crash information.  You can e-mail that to me and I can tell from that if the HPB bot is causing the crash or not (and if so, I can try to fix the bug leading to the crash).
