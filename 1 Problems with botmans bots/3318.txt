Subject: New METAMOD not compatible?

I just updated to the 1.12.2 version of METAMOD and can't get HPB_bot to run, nor can I get any bots that are based on the coding of HPB_bot to run either.  It's as simple as adding them to the liblist.gam file and putting the CFG files in the TFC dir and the .DLL file in the tfc/dlls directory.  I had it installed before the upgrade but it won't work now even after a fresh install.  I even tried disabling HLguard and Adminmod, but to no avail.  The only way HPB_Bot  works for me is if I disable metamod completely by deleting it from the liblist.gam Then I lose admin_mod and HLGuard support on the server. (dedicated)

Help?  Even tried defining the game DLLs locally in the execution string for the shortcut.  But the server errors out as soon as it hits METAMOD if I do that.  With the default install from HPB_Bot, nothing happens.  everything executes, but the server just doesn't spawn bots and I can't spawn them through server commands either.

To run bots with metamod you should add this to your command line when starting the server...
code:
+localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_bot.dll

...obviously change the "dlls/HPB_bot.dll" part to match the path and filename for the bot you are using.

Ok, the problem was that I had it in both my liblist.gam AND had it executing in localinfo as a command parameter when executing HLDS.  This caused it to crash (windows closed and logged the error) as soon as the HLDS.exe attempted to access Metamod which was at the very beginning of the script for the execution of the server.

So for those of you having the same problem, take it out of the liblist.gam and only have it execute through the command line and it'll work like a charm.

Thanks botman, for great bots.
