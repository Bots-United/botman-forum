Are you running a Server or Listenserver?

I've got a steam server, but i just un-installed my client because it was acting like a POS!
I can maybe help? Lemme know what you run.

I heard (Not sure if this is trustworthy though), make your (liblist.gam) "read-only" so the .dll line is not overwritten all the time.
That's if maybe you lost the bot's line in there.

heh, i better make sure my Steam server still functions, if so, i ran HPB_bot on it np's ..

Well, never mind i guess.. I found that if you try useing the HPB_bot for TFC Current Version 3.0 it'll crash the server with this error message if you try to build a teleporter...
members.cox.net/southpork_server/steam_error/AnyC00037.JPGError Message

But at the same time, i forget if HPB was upgraded for steam?
QUOTE:

05/04/2003 - Release 3.0
- Minor change to fix problems with x111 dedicated server release.


Maybe i musta been useing the metamod plugin version?? Or i'm confusing the old 4.1.1.1 server with the Steam server? heh.. I'm lost.. Anyway, if your trying the HPB_bot for tfc & running a dedicated server, forget it.. It'll crash if any try to build a teleporter.

I do have an updated Steam version i downloaded from the forum here though.. Not sure if it'll work? Never Mind, it's a CS update only...

I think what we need is Pierre-Marie Baty's Metamod Plugin version of the HPB_bot.. It can be found here - http://www.racc-ai.com

The HPB bot wasn't updated to handle the newer version of TFC.  There was a problem with teleporter resources not being precached when using the HPB bot.  A solution was to precache them yourself using Stripper2.

See this thread...

Ahhh, ok botman..
I just found though that Pierre-Marie Baty's Metamod Plugin works just fine too, well for TFC anyway.. I built a teleporter & no crash.

This is normal, because metamod plugins rely on metamod's database of LINK_ENTITY_BLAH_BLAH stuff, and not theirs. And metamod's database is generally supposed to always be up to date...

its a dm dedicated server, and the update was for VAC (valve anit-cheat) the only thing that changed was in my liblist.gam file and secure "1" was added. i tied to take it out, change it to "0"....no go
i also use stripper2 with no problems

Yeah, download Pierre's HPB_bot metamod plugin.
I'll check & see if i can see what the problem is with HPB_bot v3.0 in DMC server, gotta update mine.

I did just find that you have to make "liblist.gam" read-only on (client) if you wanna run a listenserver, otherwise it overwrites.

Pretty Cool that sound in DMC on map changes, unless that was just server i was on? Oh, btw.. HPB_bot does work in DMC.. I was on server using it.

Why don't you just uncheck the little box for the vac before you start the server? I just leave it on, on my TFC server.. np's ..
