I have min_bots set to 1 and max_bots set to 4. When I start the server 4 bots are added. Players join and bots disappear. What happens over the course of a day of players joining and quitting is that my server ends up with only 1 bot active no matter how many players are connected at that time. In fact right now there is no one connected to my server and there is only 1 bot when there should be 4.  Is this a known bug in HPB bot?

I'll have to look into this to see if I can find this bug.  I haven't run a dedicated server long enough with enough people connecting and disconnecting to see this problem.  I'll see if I can duplicate it by just having 1 or 2 computers on a LAN connect and disconnect over and over.  Then maybe I'll be able to track this down.
