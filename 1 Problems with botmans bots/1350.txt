How exactly does the minbot maxbot thing work. 

By this I mean how do thy pick their names for one. Is it random, meaning you could have the same name twice (ie- bot and (1)bot). Also, is it possible to assign all the same settings in the bot_names.txt file as in the bot.cfg file? Can I assign a certain class and such for those players?

The bot_names.txt file should only contain names, nothing else.

The min_bots parameter specifies what the minimum number of bots will be on this server.  As human players join the server, bots will be kicked off of the server until "min_bots" number of bots are left, then bots will no longer be kicked.  For example if min_bots was 2 and you currently had 4 bots in the game, if a human player joined the server, one bot would get kicked.  If another human player joined, one more bot would be kicked.  No more bots would get kicked after that.  You can set "min_bots" to zero if you want to kick all the bots off as human players join.

The max_bots parameter sets the total number of players (bots and humans) that you want to keep on this server.  As human players leave the server, if the total number of players is less than "max_bots" then bots will be added.  For example, if max_bots was set to 6 and there were 4 bots and 2 humans playing on a server and one of the human players left the server, one bot would be added (to keep the total number of players at 6).  If there were 4 bots and 4 human players and one of the human players left the server, no bots would be added (because there is already more than "max_bots" number of players).

When a bot is added (due to max_bots limits), the bot will created with a random name, random team and class (for MODs that support these).  The skill level will be whatever the current default skill level is (the current bot_skill setting).

The bots try not to use a name that is already in use.  They will randomly select a name and if another player is using that name, they will choose another name.  If they have tried to pick every name available and they are all used, they will choose a name that is already in use.  This can happen if the bot_names.txt file only has 5 entries and you try to create 6 or more bots.

There was (or still is) a bug where bots choose names that are already in use, but there should be several names available to choose from.  I was never able to reproduce this bug and thus was never able to fix it.  If this problem is still happening please let me know and I'll take another crack at trying to fix it.
