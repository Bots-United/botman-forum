Add this to the end of your command line when starting the server...
code:
+localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_bot.dll

botman

ok i have no idea where the command line is, i wento the pod bot half life icon, right clicked, properties and added the +localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_bot.dll to then end, wouldnt lemme play cause it had the / in the name, and you cant add / in the names. so i guess that wasnt it, i opend the pod, started my server, and added the +localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_bot.dll and it said, unknown command +localinfo..?

You will need to add it to the shortcut (like you tried the first time) except the answer I gave you was for the HPB bot not the PODbot.

You will need to change the "dlls/HPB_bot.dll" part to the path for the PODbot DLL (you can look at the original PODbot liblist.gam file for the correct directory).

Make sure you have "dlls/metamod.dll" in the cstrike\liblist.gam file so that it's loading metamod instead of POD bot.

You might also want to post this question on the POD bot forum.
