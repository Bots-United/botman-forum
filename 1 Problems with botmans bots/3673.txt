I have explored the downloads section and now I wonder which of the bots are best? (i.e. greatest AI, ready options and such)

Of my bots, the HPB bot is the most advanced.  I won't use the term "best", because there is no such thing as "best".  There's such a thing as the one that YOU like the best, but there is no "best" anything (everybody has different ideas of what "best" means).

Of the other bots, they are listed in reverse order on my Projects web page.  The Fodder Bot was the first bot I created.  It doesn't do anything except stand there and let you shoot it.  Bot Number 10 was the most recent of my Half-Life MOD type bots.

The bots between Fodder Bot and Bot Number 10 are all built as separate Half-Life MODs (i.e. you install them and run them just like you would any other MOD).  Since they are MODs, they won't work with any other MOD (i.e. you can't play Bot Number 10 in Counter-Strike since each one is a MOD and you can't load 2 MODs at the same time).

The HPB bot is a plugin-type bot which means that it will plug inbetween the Half-Life engine and whatever MOD is running (including Half-Life deathmatch).  If you want to play against bots in MODs like Half-Life deathmatch, TFC, Counter-Strike, Opposing Force, Holy Wars, Frontline Force or Deathmatch Classic, you will want to download and install the HPB bot.  Download the bot, run the executable and unzip the files into your Half-Life directory, then use Windows explorer to browse into the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder and read the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file to discover how to install the bot for the MOD that you want to play against bots in (the HPB bot has to be installed for each MOD you want bots for).
