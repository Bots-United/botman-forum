I've got a Name Demo Registration and I completely changed the host back to geocities. I need you to check it out in a few days to tell me if its working. For now use http://www.geocities.com/thesirclan/waypoint to get to the site.

In a few days that will change to http://www.waypointwarehouse.com#


Although I don't have any banners in geocities which is quite good but i will ahve a darn name demo banner at the bottom! jeeeez!
