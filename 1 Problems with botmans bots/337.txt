What browser are you using?

I just tried using mine (IE 5.5) and i was able to download. But i can't download from Warehouse if i try "Save target as.." Also another thing that hinders downloads are proxies so if your using a proxy that could be it.? 

Or refer to what Cheesemonster said above, go through the splash/front page.
Also maybe try Getright and download?
www.getright.comGetRight

Yes, Getright will work. I just tried.

Also if your not aware of spyware you should get this www.lavasoft.de/free.html[AD-aware] You can remove the spyware that comes with GetRight and it will still work.

weird i just got an: 

"HTTP 500 - Internal server error, Internet Explorer"

I had a feeling someone was flaming my site, i tried uploading everything again but everything was already there. I think it's just damn freeservers :( I might as well find a new host and change the site about...

i might as well move the site to a different host! But of course botman would need to change the link to the new site in HPB waypoint files. Note: I haven't move it yet so just in-case that happens!

Have you thought about Tripod? Or maybe Webprovider? Or even VirtualAve? Since you have a sub-domain.
