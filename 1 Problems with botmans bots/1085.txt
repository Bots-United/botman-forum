I run an online server and have added my clan tag to the bot names. This gets them listed on http://www.theclq.com and they were ranked 27th last week. :o) that is just too funny. I can't wait until they can build sg's and throw grenades. btw, if you need help testing those new features give me a shout, botman! Is that new version still on track for another week or two?

Play the (SPO) clan of Botman bot's online.

There is a link on our site that leads directly to the (SPO) clan ranking on TheCLQ btw.

Well Sh*t, theclq.com site is down right now, so you'll just have to trust me ;-)

Although I do have a screen shot from their site showing the (SPO)'s ranked 27th last week. Maybe their site will be back up soon. 

Course the bots do have an advantage over humans, I don't know anyone that plays Team Fortress 24/7!

I think that's hilarious!  I imagine that CLQ will soon have to implement a "no bots" policy.  The bots will then have to start carrying picket signs saying "Unfair to Artificial Life Forms!!!" :)

Yes, I'm working the grenade throwing stuff now.  I've also been dinking around with getting bots to spary custom logos (randomly selected from the Half-Life\logos folder).  I'm not sure if the spray logo stuff will work on Linux or not, I'll have to wait until all the Win32 stuff is done before testing it on Linux.

It definitely won't be out this weekend but I'm still shooting to have everything done by the last weekend in January.

Could you try to base the logos on the pldecal.wad instead of the directory. I use a color logo and it would be so cool if the bots could spray it. Its a Tux Penguin (linux penguin) thats dressed as a TF engineer and sitting by a sentry gun. There's a picture of it on my website, quite proud of it I am.

My plan is to allow them to randomly pick from the logos in the Half-Life\logos folder.  If there are color spray logos in this folder, the bots will use them too.  If you only want the color logo, just delete the other .bmp files.

I just checked my Linux box and realized that the isn't a Half-Life/logos folder on it, but to keep the code the same you will have to create a hlds_l/logos directory and copy any .bmp files you want to use into that directory.

It's all academic right now.  I'm still trying to get stuff to work and haven't actually got the bots spraying logos yet, but I'm pretty sure stuff will work using the "secret sneaky method" I have in mind.

Botman,

Color logos dont work like the regular logos that came with the game. They are pre compiled textures. When you select one of the greyscale images in the logos directory it basically creates the file pldecal.wad. Someone figured out that if you take a jpg and convert it to a wad you can have full color logos. 

Please, please, please. Just use the file pldecal.wad from the /tfc directory instead. It will be much better than the standard logos. Anyone wanting to use their standard logo can still use it by creating the pldecal.wad file for it. This could be done by selecting the logo you want from in game then leave game and copy file pldecal.wad into the /tfc folder of the server.

I really hope you'll at least consider that. Color logos are popular now. If you agree to do it I'll even make you a special full color BOTMAN logo that you could include as the default logo until the server admin changes it. What do ya say? If yes I'll have the logo done by Monday night, ok? How do you want it, using that barney image above? What kind of wording? "Botman's Bots" perhaps? Perhaps list the URL to your site here?

More info on color logos at www.cyber-rat.com including a tutorial on how to make a color logo and save it as a .wad file.

I hope you at least consider it.

Believe me I DO understand how logos work.  :D

I know the format that pldecal.wad uses and I know the engine requirements for .bmp files.

The problem with using pldecal.wad is that you can only have 1 logo in that file at a time.  All the bots would be spraying the SAME logo, which would be VERY boring.  I would MUCH rather have the bots randomly choose a logo from the logos folder and use that.  If you want to force them to all use the same logo, just remove the other files from the logos folder.

I am aware that the engine normally converts a color .bmp file to monochrome.  I won't be doing that.  If you have a logo that has a width and height that is a multiple of 8 and it is using 8 bit color and it is stored in an uncompress .bmp file and it exists in the Half-Life\logos folder then the bots will use it as a custom spray logo.

Like I said, believe me when I say that I know what I am doing.

P.S. I appreciate the offer to make a custom color logo, but I'm not interested in distributing a logo with the bot.  Thanks anyway.
