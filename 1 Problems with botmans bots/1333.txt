I recently tried to use Bot No. 4 on Opposing Force, but it won't let me into OpFor with it,only Half-Life! Somebody tell me how to use it on Opfor!

You can't.  You'll have to use the HPB bot on Opposing Force.

As far as I know, the HPB bot is the only bot that works with Opposing Force.  It supports OpFor deathmatch and OpFor CTF games.

Yes, thanks Botman for including Opfor support with HPB Bot.  I even got them playing Opfor CTF decently.
