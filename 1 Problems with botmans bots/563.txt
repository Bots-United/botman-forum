Well, I hope people still come here...

Botman, I'm having problems getting your Cinco bot for Half-Life to work (I got it from FilePlanet). I did everything that you said to do in the readme file, and yet Half-Life crashes when I type "addbot" in the console and press Enter. I'm wondering if you forgot to put something in said readme file. I copied the config.cfg file and the maps, and even copied a player models folder which you didn't mention. Was I supposed to copy anything else to the "Bot" folder? 
p.s. I am running Half-Life version 1.0.0.9.

You will need to upgrade to Half-Life version 1.0.1.3 (or higher, but NO higher than 1.0.1.6) to run the Cinco bot (or any bot before Bot Number 8).  Bot Number 8, 9, and 10 require Half-Life version 1.1.0.0 or higher.

Thanks, Botman.
Which, if any, of your bots use version 1.0.0.9? I'd rather not download any update patches.

None.  There are no bots that will work with Half-Life version 1.0.0.9.  Valve didn't implement fake client (bot) support until the 1.0.1.3 version of the engine.

Well, then, it looks like I'll have to download at least one update patch. I just hope that I don't have to download a string of them, in other words, that there's one patch that will take me directly from 1.0.0.9 to 1.0.1.3. 
Also, while I know this isn't a Half-Life strategy forum, I'll try this anyway:
I'm stuck at the part with the 3 huge tentacle-things in the rocket test chamber. I turned on the fuel and oxidizer to the engine, but there is also a "Power" light on the firing room's control panel. That light isn't lit yet, and therefore  the engine won't fire. How do I turn that light on?

I don't think there is an update from 1.0.0.9 to 1.0.1.3.  If I remember correctly, there was a 1.0.0.9 to 1.0.1.0 patch and another update from 1.0.1.0 to 1.0.1.3

You have to turn on the generator (which if I remember correctly is all the way down in the bottom of that level).  I think you had to get on the elevator that suddenly drops to the ground and jump from the edge of it to a ladder on the wall beside it (but it's been a LONG time since I've played the single player game and might be getting 2 different levels confused).

You might want to search for a "Half-Life walkthrough" to help you in areas where you get stuck.
