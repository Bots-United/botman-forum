 can you add that option were bots randomly select through teams and classes? you said it was easy to do and the text saying "this team sucks im switching" sounds really cool...good and useful...if it's easy enough you can add it tomorrow ...please...please ;D ;D ;D lol

I can see it now, every 5 minutes, a bot will switch teams, and REALLY lag down the game.

No thanks. I like to see the bot build SG's. But, knowing botman's physicial condition, I can wait till he gets better.

how would this lag it down? and like he said it is real easy so he might be able to do that alot quicker then making bots builds sg's
