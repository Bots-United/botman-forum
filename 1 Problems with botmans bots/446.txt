Excellant program botman. Question: Every so often when 2 bots come at each other from 2 different waypoints. They clash and start dancing with each other. They do try to look left than right and sometimes jump but they stay stuck until they see an enemy. How can I fix this so that when they clash, they turn around 180 degrees and go back the way they came? I've looked at the botstuck code but can't figure out how to detect if someone is in it's way.

TIA

If the bot is blocked you can use UTIL_TraceLine() to trace a line out in front of the bot then look at the trace result to see what the classname is of the entity that was hit.  If the classname is "player" then the bot is blocked by another bot or another player.
