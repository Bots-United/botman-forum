Here's some quotes from "Full Metal Jacket"...

I'd forgotten about most of them.  One of my favorites was...

Gunnery Sergeant Hartman: "Did your parents have any children that lived?"
Private Pyle: "Sir, Yes sir!"
Gunnery Sergeant Hartman: "I'll bet they regret that.  You're so ugly you could be a modern art masterpiece!"
