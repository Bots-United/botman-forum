whenever i add bots in flf v.1.1 with HPB bot v.4.1.a,they run to someplace,get stuck when there is alot of people there at the same time,and starts shooting each other(only bots on the same team do this) at first i though they were shooting at something but it turns out that they are shooting each other!!! needless to say,this makes playing with bots impossible. i need the hpb bot maker to fix this. and no,it is   not the linux version of hpb bot.

Try reinatalling Half-Life. Getting the latest version, and reinstall FLF 1.1 again. And see if that helps.

botman -
   This problem is real. Don't tell me to reinstall it because it wouldn't do anything. I've all ready debugged my comp. Everything else works perfectly. This is a VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY rare bug that pops up maybe after 4 hours of playing. One of the bots (in FLF version 1.1) will get surrounded by every other bot on his team and start shooting randomly. So far this only happened on FLF_Job but take a look into it please.

P.S Great bot, botman, but could you PLEASE improve the combat code? I should send you some of my screenies of playing with the bots for 2 hours ( an example: KILLS: 465 DEATHS: 5 and thats not being a sniper thats random player class : )

P.P.S IMPROVE THE COMBT CODE : )

I've only noticed the pyscho shooting bug you describe when I kick a bot from the game.  After I kick a few bots all the other bots in the game go completely psycho and start shooting at everything.  Solution:  Don't kick bots from the game.

Yep, there's definitely a bug with kicking the bots (then adding them back) in Front Line Force.  If you don't want this bug to happen then don't kick them in the first place.

there is still a bug in tfc when u kick the bots and add them again. The fact is that the bots that you kicked will join again so they have the same name and amount of frags etc. Also if you kick a bot, for instance, on the blue team and add the bot again to the blue team, it wont join the blue team until you change team. But if you kick a bot on the blue team, for example, and add a bot to the red team, it works properly except it says "botname has changed to team X"

I can't fix it if I can't duplicate it.  If you refuse to uninstall Half-Life and reinstall and update to version 1.1.0.4, then there is nothing more I can do for you.

well,botman,is it because the HPB bot is incompatible with FLF v.1.1?because the hpb bot 4.1a is for FLF 1.0 only.and yes,the probelm with the frags exsits on FLF too.and thereinstall suggestion did not work.

HPB bot 4.1a was released to fix a bug with FLF 1.1, so it is compatible with FLF 1.1
