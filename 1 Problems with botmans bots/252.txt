Well i know u programmed the bot do cap the flag as quick qs possible and (if in flag possesion) not to engage in combat....

Ive playd with the new beta for about 4hours non stop and ive been able to stop the flagrunner without him shooting back at me...

maybe you could program the bot to engage in combat when in flagpossesion but when the bots reaches a lower health status it should try to get away and cap the flag

i know its verry hard to do this but it would be SOOOO cool if the bots would try to kill me when i try to prevent them from capping

Anyways keep up the good work Botmam your doing great !!!!!!!

Yes, like I said in the news on my main page, it's difficult to have the bots NOT run into a battle and at the same time defend themselves when attacked.  I guess what I could do would be to only engage in combat if they are attacked.  And maybe only engage in combat if the attacker is in the same general direction that they are headed.  If they get involved in a battle and win, then they continue on their way to the capture point, but if the stray off the path to the capture point, they may wind up falling off a ledge or getting into areas where getting back to the capture point is much more difficult.
