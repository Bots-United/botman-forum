i was playing on my buddy voogru's server and he said he was going to take control of me. it showed the message "Chooco is now under Voogru's control" and he was moving me around pretty good but a bit laggy. one of the guys watching said "lol you got that from botman's bot program" and voogru said "modified slightly"

from that i gathered that your bot program has some way of letting me control them. does it work for humans too? i want to be able to control people on my server, i already use adminop to grab entities and move them around sort of like yoda...... they think it would be pretty funny if i could do that so here i am asking. i read the readme.txt in HPB bot but i didn't see anything like that in there.

Sure, you could take the HPB bot source code or use a metamod plugin to effect the movements of other players.

You can do this by changing the velocity of players (moving them in one direction or another).  You could also make them fire weapons (or switch from one weapon to another) by simulating button presses from that client.

You would only be able to do this on a server that was running the modified HPB bot (or metamod plugin).  You can't do stuff like this from a client that's connected to an unmodified server.

If you want to try moving people around, just set the pEdict->v.velocity edict_t variable to some vector indicating the direction you want that player to move.  Your on your own figuring out a good method to do this.  Your also on your own figuring out how to get people to switch or fire weapons.
