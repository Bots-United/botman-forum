When you run the .exe it will overwrite all the files currently in the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder.

Before running the .exe you may want to run the current Remove.bat files for the MODs that you have the HPB bot installed with (for example Half-Life\HPB_bot\tfc\Remove.bat).

Once you've uninstalled (removed) the old HPB bot stuff you can run the HPB bot .exe download and extract the new files to you Half-Life directory (where hl.exe is located).  This will overwrite the files in Half-Life\HPB_bot and place the new files there.  Then just run the Install.bat in the HPB_bot MOD directories (i.e. Half-Life\HPB_bot\tfc\Install.bat).  This will copy all the new files to their proper place.

When are done installing the new HPB bot version you can go into the MOD maps folder and delete the .wpt files (since they are needed anymore), BUT if you have downloaded any additional waypoint files don't delete those.

The new HPB bot code will rename the old .wpt files to .HPB_wpt if it doesn't find a .HPB_wpt file in the maps folder (so if you downloaded some .wpt files they will still get used by the new code, you don't have to rename them yourself).  After the waypoint file gets loaded the new code will rename the old .wpt file to .HPB_wpt instead.  It will only do this for the current map so if you cycle through all the maps then it will eventually rename all of the .wpt files.

You can also delete the .wp1, .wp2, .wp3, or .wp4 files.  They won't be used anymore.  The new code will create the new .HPB_wp1, .HPB_wp2, etc. filenames.
