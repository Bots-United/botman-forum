I want to compile the metamod plugin for Linux so I can play with adminmod and stuff.  So I go to build, and get this HUGE slew of errors and it ends in "Error 1" on bot.o.  I installed dos2unix and tried converting the lines with a command line something like this:

dos2unix --d2u /home/mike/HPB_bot_plugin/*.* /home/mike/HPB_bot_plugin/*.*

but it makes no difference.  Please, I need bots for target practice and stat boosting on my hlds, if anyone has a solution.

The metamod plugin was written and compiled on a Windows machine. It is portable to Linux, but it requires a little bit of work. Only the fact that I had no Linux machine available to compile the plugin caused me to release a Win32 version only.

If I knew how to port it, I'd get crackin and give you a hand, but I'm not a very good coder and I have no idea where to start.

Actually, if the HPB bot didn't have a segmentation (sp) dump or whatever everytime I tried to run it as localinfo mm_gamedll under Metamod, I wouldn't care either way.  And all the files were in the cstrike directory.

Well for a start you could post the first lines of your error log, and also by looking up into the .cpp files they refer to, the few lines of context above and below the line of code that caused the error. :)
