I can't do,
odd addbot 2 2 <--- Dosen't seem to work.
No oddbot will join.
But i've done,
hpb addbot 1 2  <-- This works.
fox addbot 2 3 <-- This works.

These are all i've tried so far.
But i've compensated by creating an "odd_bot.cfg" in which i've put,
addbot 2 4
addbot 2 5
addbot 2 2
addbot 2 3
addbot 2 8
addbot 2 9
addbot 2 4
addbot 2 3
Then i have all the Oddbot's joining team 2 & i made a "HPB_bot.cfg" which has All of the HPB_bot's joining team 1 & useing the percent values.
Only other problem i encountered was, i was playing at 60mins & cycled through 2 maps, after dustbowl it went to crossover2 which was the 3rd map & it added more bots to the game. I checked to make sure i had no bot.cfg or anything .cfg that would add more for these maps & found nothing. Oh well, very minor problems since the BotMaster5000 is in Prototype stage anyways.. So i guess this is to be expected. This BotMaster5000 is Awesome botman!!!!!!!!! Going to try some CS & FLF later.. I see you didn't try JoeBot for CS.. That's what i really want to checkout agianst PODbot! JoeBot VS PODbot...... Whoa! Oughta be Good..!! Hopefully JoeBot will be compatible..

Im amazed
In those TFC pics you were running different bots and lots of them but in one pic your ping was only 15 or something 

How ? surley having lots of different DLLS and loads of bots would slow your comp to hell ?

Mind you though the CS pic wasnt very good.

The ping time reflects being on a local machine.  The frame rate is a better indication of how loaded the CPU is with multiple bots.  You can see in the TFC pictures that my frame rate dropped to about 9 FPS.  Normally it's in the 25-30 FPS range.  Also a large number of bots (30) will slow the machine down considerably whether it's a single type of bot or multiple types of bots.

Excellent!! To hear JoeBot works.. Going to try that out in a little bit.. :)

I renamed all of my FLF waypoints & did the batch files for the BotMaster5000, Cool it works! Oddbot VS HPB_bot ... The BotMaster5000 is truely the greatest invention!! hehe... 
grubber.hypermart.net/Download/frontline.zipHere's the files if anyone wants them. The remove.bat works correctly too! Just extract them to your BotMaster5000 directory..

PopDog, this sounds goofy, but now that i've been playing TFC with 2 different bots & say i play "well or dustbowl", kinda seems like it plays better then just loading 1 bot... Maybe it's all in my mind though? hehe... I've had 3 different bots in but i like just 2 opposing bots at a time for now.. Unless i find or create some murderball2c waypoints... ;D That'll be Fun! Let's see,
Team1 = HPB_bot
Team2 = Oddbot
Team3 = FoXBot
Team4 = Abot OR TEAMbot

Hey botman, 

The retail owners has a different folder name than cstrike, (counter-strike folder)

the bat install file should be modified

(poor retail owners, all the trouble they have)
