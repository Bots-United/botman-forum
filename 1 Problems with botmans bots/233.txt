When you have the key in rock2, bots from your own team start shooting at you. They don't do it in other maps, but they do it in this map, why is that?

Because the skins in the keycard.mdl are 1 less than the skins in the flag.mdl and I was using the skin to identify which team is carrying the flag/keycard.

The just released HPB bot Beta 1.1 version doesn't have this problem.
