Example #1
If you want to kick all of the bots, you could make a ".cfg" file and add this into it:

kick # 2
kick # 3
kick # 4
kick # 5
kick # 6
etc. etc. etc. I've made one that goes to 100, which is good for about so many kick's till it expires. Because the bot's id # can go to infinity.. 
What you could do if you want is to download my menu zip dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=3&action=display&num=1229HERE You don't have to use the menu, but just extract the "Kickall.cfg" file in there and place that into your TFC directory, so when your in a game all you'll have to do is bring down the console and type: exec kickall.cfg  .... And whatever bots are currently in your game will get kicked.

-------------------------
Example # 2
Another way of doing it is, Say that you only want to kick 4 bot's out of 10 .. 
Bring down your console and type:  status  .. Then you'll see something like this: # 2 BillyBob[Twit] 6 -- Which means, BillyBob[Twit]'s id # is 6. So say you have:
# 2 BillyBob[Twit] 6
# 5 ActionBob 9
# 8 BuckaRoo 11
# 11 PieHole 15

You could then type this: kick #6;kick #9;kick #11;kick #15 Whala there gone..

You can kick them by player number, as Grubber shows, or you can kick them by name like this...

kick "Moving_Target"

If you always create the bots with specific names, you can create a config file to execute from the console that will kick them all.  For example if my bot.cfg file had this for TFC...

addbot 1 3 "botA"
addbot 2 5 "botB"
addbot 1 2 "botC"
addbot 2 6 "botD"
addbot 1 1 "botE"
addbot 2 4 "botF"

...I could create a file called "kickbot.cfg" that had this...

kick "botA"
kick "botB"
kick "botC"
kick "botD"
kick "botE"
kick "botF"

...which would kick all the bots from the server.

It's not worthwhile for me to add a "removebots" command since you vary rarely would want to kick all the bots from a server on Half-Life deathmatch, TFC, OpFor, or Front Line Force.
