Hello

The Botmixer5000 seemed so cool, I just had to test it... But it didn't work! 

It says in the readme that the Botmixer ONLY works with the HL engine 1.1.0.8 or higher. 
Well,I've got the CS retail version and it seems to me like there is no update from 1.1.0.6, which I have along with CS 1.3 (Maybe I'm just stooped)...

What happens when I try to play is that CS crashes(anything mysterious?...).

Now, I wonder, is there any older version of botmixer or anything like it avaiable for me or is there a 1.1.0.8-update for the CS-retail version that I could not find??? 

And I thought I wasn't a newbie any more...

Thanks

what bots are you using with it because some bots make it crash.

I'm using PODbot and JOEbot which both use the file bot.cfg, which it said in the readme, could cause problems...

But, I don't know... feel real stooped...
I'll test other bots, even thought it says in the readme that HL engine 1.1.0.8 is required...

I want a botmixer!!! I'm gonna break down and cry soon... 8{

Simply: All I want to know if there is any way to be able to play with the Botmixer and CS-retail or if there is any other thing like the Botmixer.

Thanks again

I don't have the retail version of Counter-Strike, so I can't tell you if it will work with it or not.  The install batch files were written to work with the retail version of Half-Life and the downloadable version of Counter-Strike.

You could try to manually copy the files yourself (by doing what the .bat files would normally do) and see if that works.  If it's crashing it sounds like you didn't have any trouble running hte batch files though.

The .bat file works perfect but still not the game - with the JOE- and TEAMbot.

OMG! I only had the HL engine 1.0.0.3! When I try to upgrade it says that I'm up to date... There isn't any update for CS-retail, right?
 Is the HL engine 1.1.0.8 really needed, is it that which messes it up?

I'm not really good with computers...

I'm not sure if the retail Counter-Strike engine version matches the Half-Life engine version or not.  Half-Life didn't support bots until engine version 1.0.1.3.  The current downloadable version of Counter-Strike (1.3) requires Half-Life engine version 1.1.0.0 or higher.

CS engine 1.0.0.3 may be the same as Half-Life 1.1.0.8, I just don't know.

I thought of that too...

Maybe I've just done something wrong then, because I just don't get it to work...

You can delete this thread now... I allow you to do it...
...(Then I don't have to live with my n00b acts here :), I don't think it will help anybody else...) 

ashamed...

I have the counter-strike retail version and BotMixer5000. I can run podbot and joe bot at the same time with no problem.
