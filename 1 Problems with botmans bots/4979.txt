Any clue what this is or if it's serious ?  Ever since this started showing up in my logs my server crashes randomly.  thx!

...because the original HPB_bot.dll is NOT a metamod plugin, and you try to run it as such.

To run the HPB_bot as a metamod plugin, download my metamod port of it instead. (HPB_bot_mm.dll)

oh, ok.  i installed this bot for someone using the +localinfo ... but i guess they still had something in their metamod plugins.ini from before when it wasnt working - thanks for the heads up
