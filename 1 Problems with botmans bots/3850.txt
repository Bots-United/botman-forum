While I was going through the Monster Mod source, I remembered when I first got Monster Mod. I used it on the map CROSSFIRE, but on a different mod, DragonModZ. When I spawned an apache I remember it flying after players and shooting them but now all the apache does is spin in circles and move straight up from where it was spawned. I haven't used it on Crossfire since that first time. What is wrong & how can I fix it?? Could it be MetaMod? When I first got the Monster plugin, I had an older version of MetaMod.

Make sure you don't spawn the apache too high in the sky (it will collide with the sky brush and not be able to move).

Try spawning it about 100 units up from the ground to see if it behaves properly.

Sorry, I mean to mention I was doing normal spawning...hmmm, the first time I used it tho I used the crossfire monster config...that can't be it tho since the apache has only spun in cicrcles and gone straight up in other maps I have it auto-spawn in, i always have it spawn far away from the sky, ground, and any other objects. When I first used Monster Mod, support for DragonModZ hadn't been implimented into MetaMod yet, could that be it?

I don't think that should matter.

I know that other people have played around with adding in entities using Stripper2 to get the apache to follow.  Try using the "Search" feature at the top to search this Metamod group for "apache path_corner" and see if that helps.

Hmm. Oh, could it be because when I spawn the apache it is in the ground? The first time I used the monster plugin I had the apache spawn above ground. BTW That whole path_corner thing doesn't seem worth it, setting the path for all the maps I wanted the apache on =/

Spawning ANY entity inside a solid (like a world brush or other entity) will cause the entity to not be able to move.

You should spawn the entity in open space and make SURE that you have enough clearance on all sides so that it is not touching the world or any other entity.

Ahh okay. Is there any way I could edit the code to make apaches spawn at least 20 units above the ground?

Oh and, is the controller supposed to fly around or wasn't that added in yet?

Sure, if you know C++, you could modify the source code to spawn an apache higher up off the ground (and further away from players when spawning them dynamically).

The controllers will fly around and shoot energy balls at you.  Without path_corner entities, they will usually just move off to one spot and sit there shooting at you.  You NEED path_corner entities if you want them to navigate around.

Heh oh well, maybe sometime when I am not extremely lazy I will set up some path_corners for a map or two & mess with the monster source. Oh by the way I did some testing last night, i set it up a MAPNAME_monster.cfg for a map with alot of open space, had the apache spawn in a very clear place (no entities or solids near it) and the d*** thing still spun in circles & went straight up slowly >_< *Sigh*

Today @ school in Computer Programming, I was thinking about getting the apache to work correctly. I could think of only two things, mp_allowmonsters & monster_spawn! I forgot that I always had them set to "0" & I didn't when I first used the monster plugin. So, could that be the problem or at least part of the problem? Oh and monsters still spawn in maps when they are set to "0" (Stating the obvious but I thought I should mention it anyways)

Ahh nevermind. Everything I tried doesn't work. I have a few more ideas, like not using stripper (didn't have it when I first had monster), and some other stuff I cant remember right now cuz I am in school =/

Oh well, it's not /THAT/ important, sorry for wasting some of yer tiem BotMan
