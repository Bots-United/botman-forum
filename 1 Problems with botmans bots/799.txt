How come when I play Frontline Force the enemy bots always come around the corner or switch to grenade when being attacked. I end up mowing them all over because the weapon they have out sux. The skill is 3 also

Yes that's a problem.  They should only have grens out when enemy's are at a distance.  I've seen them camp at a defense point with a flash grenade in their hand.  LOL.
