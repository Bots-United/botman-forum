I get a message "cannot load conback.lmp" when I load botman and try to do a multiplayer game.  I recently upgraded the version  and it was working before.  My friend gets the same message now also.  
It is in botman 9 or 10

Just delete the "cached.wad" file from the Half-Life\bot folder and it should work without that error.

botman
