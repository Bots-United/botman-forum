Still on schedule? Will we see it before next weekend?

My poor TF server crashes at least once a day all a sudden so I want to reinstall hlds_l, hlds_ld and hpb_bot but been waiting for your new release. :o(

Sorry to bug you, just trying to find out if I can reinstall by next weekend with new version or if I should just do the deed now.

:D I can't wait for new version...none of the other TF bots can build SGs and such yet.  Careful Botman, there's so many out there, someone might get ahead of you! ;)

You guys don't understand. Botman's the genius of the TFC bot! Without him, we would still be playing online, with our laggy 56K modems!

He's the reason why TFC bots have been poping up like popcorn in the wintertime! :) So give the botman a hand!

I just uploaded the new version.  I've been sick the last few days and haven't been doing any bot coding, just puking my guts out and sweating in bed.

That's kinda how us linux guys are. We find a program that works good and we don't change. You know, I hear that a certain *other* operating system has a web server, but that doesn't mean I am going to change from Apache. If that *other* OS has features that Apache doesn't well then I'll just wait for the next version of Apache to be released. It's the same case when it comes to bots. Botman's HPB_bot works great so why switch to another. Besides that, the only other bot I have heard of for linux and tfc is the oddbot. No offense to that bots author if he's reading BUT after hearing that the author got RH for x-mas I became a little skepticle. If I ever did change to oddbot it wouldn't be for at least a couple of rev's. I want to see continued stability. Even with Botman, I didn't add bots to my server until version 4 of hpb_bot. I should probably say that my server is a 24/7 internet server. Bots and Live players. I prefer a stable server over sg building bots, although a stable server with sg building bots would be nice ;o)

So Botman, when do you think that might be out. If its only a week or two then I will probably wait for that release.

"So Botman, when do you think that might be out."

Probably in a week or two.  I'm trying to get sentry/dispenser building and custom spray logos in the next release.

Brian, let me know if 4.2a fixes the problems with bots not being added when players leave the server and the "bot" CVAR sometimes not working properly.

What do you mean by bot CVAR not working properly? I should probably know what your talking about but I don't. :o(

And I now use the 2fort_bot.cfg type files for adding bots. I put 4 bots in per map, no more no less. You see my server bandwidth supports no more than 8 remote players. I run a 12 person server, 4 bots 8 real. At one time I thought it would be neat to keep the server full with bots when real players not around but gave up on that. Perhaps I'll look into it again with this new version and the max bots feature. 

I'll keep you posted on my success. I'm off for lunch break now (at work right now) but when I get back I'll be downloading and installing 4.2a 

Gotta love telnet access to linux. I'll have the new bots installed and configured before I even get home tonight <g>

In versions prior to 4.2a, the bot CVAR wouldn't get executed after a map change.  I was checking the "bot" cvar every second to see if the dedicated server operator was issuing a bot command (like addbot, etc.).  Each time I would check the cvar, I'd set the next time when it needed to be checked (current time + 1 second).  The bug was that when a map change occurred, the cvar check time was not being reset back to zero (which it should because loading a new map sets the server time back to zero).  This meant that any new "bot" commands wouldn't be executed after a map change.  If you were only using the bot.cfg or map specific bot.cfg files to create bots then you might not have ever noticed this bug.

I haven't noticed any bugs when I had the 4.2a version.

I still like when you see when a bot throws a grenade, he backs up. And some of the bots who see the grenade, back up so they won't get hurt by it. Very humanlike!

The reason I went to map specific bot configs is because of that bug. But since have realized I like it better. Rather than a bunch of random names I like to use specific bot names and classes on specific maps. I will probably continue using this method.

I better get goin on downloading the new version. got busy after lunch and aint done it yet. :o( Only an hour til beer-thirty ... er quiting time, too.
