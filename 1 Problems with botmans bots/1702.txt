The HPB bot works in TFC
Unzip it your Half-Life directory then open the folder called HPB Bot then the TFC folder within that.
Then install with the autoinstaller.
Now start up Half-Life and select TFC from the Custom Game menu.
Now go to mulitplayer and then LAN game.
Create a game and once you pick a team and class a few other bots should join.
Check out the readme in the HPB Bot folder for more help
