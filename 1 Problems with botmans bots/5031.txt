I guess you are using metamod, in that case, There is nothing wrong with that 'error' it's just a message saying that metamod is newer than the bot and there might be a new version of the bot, that's all

No, it says clearly "game DLL". I suspect Steam is harassing us again. These folks definitely have nothing better to do, or have they ?

Use the metamod version of the bot instead.
