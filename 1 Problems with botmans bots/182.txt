Bug:

After playing DUSTBOWL, the attackers have problems.
I believe that you have used a method with flag carriers which is the opposite in dustbowl.
The attackers pick up a BLUE FLAG in the DUSTBOWL map, the bots must look at the flag carrier 
thinking that they are the enemy since the carrier has THEIR flag. This results in the bots 
shooting at their team-mate who is in the BLUE team, carrying the BLUE flag.

I think this is the problem as I seen some DEFENDERS trying to pick up the BLUE flag!

There must be some other way to determine who actaually has the flag, is there?

On spacedout they seem to be slightly attracted to their own key as well.

Yes, in the code as I have it now, blue team members will shoot at ANY team member carrying their own flag.  That I can fix by looking to see what team the flag carrier is on.  But what I can't fix is knowing whether the blue team or the red team is supposed to pick up a blue flag (since in some maps it's one way and in other maps it's the opposite way).

I haven't had time to play any maps with keycards in them yet.  The key is handled just like the flag.  Bot will try to pick up the key if it's not the same color as their team color (i.e. blue team only picks up the red key).
