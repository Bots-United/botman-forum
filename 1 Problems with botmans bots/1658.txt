Oh, this is what i forgot to mention..
I've set bot_grenade_time 0
But i notice that they will still throw grenades.
Also bot_logo_percent 0 But they will still spray.

The only reason why i didn't want logo's was i switched to my cards Direct 3D and for some reason i can't see the logo's, mine either so i figured i'd turn them off. But the sniper's would still spray.
But i've since changed back to OpenGL, cuz i like seeing the logo.
hehehe.. I can't win, if i goto OpenGL my water is cloudy ( Alge like looking ) can't see from one side to the other in "well" .. But direct 3D let's me see water perfectly clear! But i loose the logo functionality.. DOH!! What a pisser.. hehe .. I've got a GeForce 2 MX and have read that the cloudy water in Half-Life hasn't been fixable in OpenGL, even updated the driver's to 6.50 detanator driver.. 6.50 Cuz it's suppossed to be the most stable, i tried 7 but almost had to format cuz i lost my video.. I was freakin..

Setting "bot_grenade_time" to 0 does not turn off grenade usage.  It sets the minimum time between grenades to zero seconds.  See this in the bot.cfg file...

"Note: setting bot_grenade_time to 0 does NOT guarantee that the bots will throw one grenade right after the other.  The bots will randomly decide when to throw a grenade but won't throw one unless bot_grenade_time seconds has elapsed since the previous grenade (i.e. you can't force the bots to grenade spam)"

bot_grenade_time is used to prevent the bots from grenade spamming.  Setting it to 30 will make the bots wait AT LEAST 30 seconds before throwing another grenade, but the bot chooses the time to throw grenades RANDOMLY (which means it could be another 10 minutes before it decides to throw a grenade).

There isn't any parameter right now that will prevent the bots from using grenades.

With the bot_logo_percent set to 0 the bots should NEVER spray a logo.  Make sure you are setting the bot_logo_percent before spawning any bots and also make sure that you don't have different settings for "bot_logo_percent" in the bot.cfg file and any map specific bot.cfg files (i.e. bot_logo_percent is 0 in bot.cfg, but bot_log_percent is 20 in 2fort_bot.cfg).

Direct 3d Bad!  Opengl Good!  Never panic when you are losing video there is always F8.
