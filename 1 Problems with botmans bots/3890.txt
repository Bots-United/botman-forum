Hi,
I'm running HLDS on a linux box with the TFC mod. I also have HPB bot, AdminMod, Halfd, and HLguard running on the server.  I can manually add and remove bots with no problem; the server has run for over a week, with the bots on it, but as soon as I send the HPB_bot max_bots command, the server crashes.  I find it does the same for the min_bots command.  I have both of these vars set in the HPB config file, but it seems to partialy ignore them.  It will not add bots on its own, but will sometimes remove them when players join.  This causes a problem because by the end of the day there will be only one bot left running around by himself. Thank you for your help.

I'm not sure what could be wrong.

You can try setting min_bots and max_bots in map specific bot .cfg files if you want to change the number of bots on some maps.

The crashing problem could be caused by using an invalid argument (or no argument) to the "min_bots" or "max_bots" command.  There's VERY little error checking on the bot commands.  Providing invalid input can lead to crashes.  For example, I believe if you do this...

max_bots

...without a numeric value as an argument, it will crash the server.
