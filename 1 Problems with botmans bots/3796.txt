No matter what skill level I have the bots at they just seem to be the same, skill 1 (the best) is no different from skill 5. Is it possible to make the bot a little tougher to play against? I also have bot reaction time at 1. Thx

The main difference in the skill levels is how quickly they fire.

Level 1 is the best they are going to be and you can't make them any harder to play against.
