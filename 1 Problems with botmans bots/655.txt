Hello, is it possible to compile a Client or SP DLL with one of the free compilers out there?
*seems to me its crewl to make such a great game then make it expensive as hell to make a SP mod for it =(*

I have had some success building the single player hl.dll using the Borland 5.5 compiler.  You can download the compiler here...

You have to change the format of the SetThink(), SetUse(), and SetTouch() function calls to get it to compile properly.

I will be working on it some more over the next few days and may be able to provide something that would allow you to build the hl.dll file using Borland and maybe MingW32.

You can't build the client.dll because Valve compiled the VGUI functions need to initialize the display using Microsoft Visual C++.  The only compiler that will handle the VGUI library is Microsoft's.  So until Valve releases the VGUI source code, you will have to use MSVC.
