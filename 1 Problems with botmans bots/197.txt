I would just want to know if there's a chance that you can get the bots for cs go in the vents and camp.  Not as a major spot but is it a possibility? Jus wanna know and my shout out to Botman as usual. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!:)

Try setting a crouch waypoint neat and in the vent, then make the waypoint thats in the vent a sniperspot they then will hang out a little over there
(to set crouch waypoints just duck and place a waypoint)
