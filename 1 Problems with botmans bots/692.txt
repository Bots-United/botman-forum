First FLF, the bot's play really good!!
But seems i can't play with more then 4 or i get real bad lag! When i left it at defualt, (the 6 bots) my lag went as high as 145.. I don't think it's cuz of the flash gernades.? It just seems when i get into combat [i]period[/i] the latencey goes real high. Oh and this is a minor problem, but when the bot's whine the name of the bot doing the whining is sometimes not all there, example: ead_meat you are sooooo good... NOT!
Instead of Dead_meat you are sooooo good... NOT!

Ok TFC, 
I was trying the kick in hunted. So i was kicking the <font color="Blue">civilian</font> and then i would <font color="Blue">addbot 1</font> and what would happen is the same bot would join agian as <font color="Blue">civilian</font> but then switch to <font color="Red">bodyguards</font>. It would say this in the console in this order: 
Creating bot ...
Bob has changed to team 2
Bob died
Even though that last line says Bob died, he really didn't cuz he did join and is playing for the <font color="Red">bodyguards</font>.
Then i would <font color="Blue">addbot 1</font> agian and i would get a new <font color="Blue">civilian</font> no problem. But then i played a little 2fort and kicked the sniper on my team and did addbot 2 2 and the same sniper would come back but stay unassigned and wouldn't rejoin. Tried the same kicking a bot from the other team and the same thing happened, so i had now 2 unassigned and not rejoining. But the snipers facing foward fix hehe.. works GOOD!!
<font color="Green">Well till i find out, i'm going back to play some more of each MOD.. Especially FLF!!! 8)</font>

Maybe FLF latency problem has to do with me and not bot..? My system is Win98 Celeron 400 MMX, 168 MB, ATI Rage Pro. Everything is up to date.

Not to be a stupid idiot, but what is FLF? I know it's a mod, but what is it about? Features, weapons, all of that stuff.

Here ya go, (scroll through this post)
dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=3&action=display&num=641Front Line Force Should maybe hopefully give ya a lil better understanding <font color="Brown">[i]BeaverMon[/i]</font>..?

Also [b]botman[/b], that's right, i forgot to say that when ReDucTor[FGW] released his first beta of FLF (Agro bot) i was able to add alot of bots in game (like 6 vs 6) without that serious lag i mentioned above. Hmmm, maybe it does have to do with the flash? But when im in battle at times and there's no flash, my latency still goes really high and it becomes so choppy that i just get killed if enemies around.
Well i've been playing with total of 4 bots, but like i said it still gets laggy/choppy. <font color="Red">Looks like maybe i'm the only one having FLF problem</font>..? :(
Ya know what, when i'm online and go into battle agianst human players my latency get's pretty high also when in battle. But only it has a really bad reaction, my system freeze's and i have to hit the reboot button. It's happened 3 times, that's why i was glad to hear you were going to make the bot. Yep, i guess it must be me..

The "kick" problem in TFC apparently isn't "fully" fixed yet. ;)  I'll work on getting it straightened out in the next release.  I was rushing trying to get everything working in FLF and didn't test everything as well as a usually do.  I wouldn't have put it in this release if I knew it wasn't working properly.

I don't have any lag problems playing 7 bots vs. 7 bots plus me (15 players) on FLF (except during heavy firefight times and several grenades going off at once).  I'll look into the bot whine message problems also.  You'll notice that you don't get the welcome message (HPB bot - planethalflife.com/botman...blah, blah, blah) in FLF.  I am sending that message 5 seconds after the player comes out of observer mode which, in TFC and CS, only happens after the player has selected the team and class.  The welcome message does get sent to the player, it justs get sent long bofore the player is actually in the game and can see the message.

There are quite a few other FLF problems that I have found, but like I said, I was rushing to get this out and didn't have time to fix all the bugs.  I think if you kick players and add them back in FLF they wind up attacking their teammates (or it might be that I added them back using invalid team numbers (like 3 or 4), or used random team number (5).  I'm not really sure what I did to cause this problem, but it was too late to try to fix it.

I'll work on both of these issues over the next few days.
