1- You can get my POD-bot 2.6 metamod plugin conversion at http://www.racc-ai.com , downloads section, bottom of page.

2- You can look at many open-source CS bots out there, JoeBot, POD-Bot, RACC preview, being all based off botman's template ; if you want to look at the RACC preview, you'll be interested by the BotBuyStuff() function.
