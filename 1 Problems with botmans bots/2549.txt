Hello all.

Problem. Did you notice that when HPB is set up over your Half-Life installation, you can't start a normal Half-Life game, neither an Opposing Force training course ?

The problem with Half-Life is that the player gets stuck in the train at the very beginning of the game, as the guard doesn't come and open the door.

For Opposing Force's training course, that's the barracks' main door which remains closed, and the player gets stuck in the sas and can't reach the outside world.

Now when you set up your liblist.gam's respectively to call the standard dlls and NOT the HPB bot, everything works perfectly.

I don't know how to debug that, neither I have an idea why this occurs. Maybe some LINK_ENTITY_TO_FUNC() are missing, that could be why the guard can't "see" the train stopping ?

This is rather annoying... I don't see myself writing an awful hack for swapping dlls in order to play the game or the HPB.

Botman, what do you think of it ?

I am aware that the HPB bot installed will cause problems with the single player game.  At one point this was working (with the 1.0.1.6 Half-Life engine).  After the 1.1.0.0 update it didn't work any longer.  I never could figure out what was causing the Barney at the end of the train ride to not get triggered.

If you wish to play single player games you will need to either uninstall the HPB bot (using the Remove.bat file) or modify the valve\liblist.gam file to load the hl.dll instead of the HPB_bot.dll file.
