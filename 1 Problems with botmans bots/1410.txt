is it gone or something? Cuz I can't get on it...


And how the hell is my site getting so much publicity? After like no new waypoints in over a month, I've been getting a couple of requests a day... Someone explain

I am not sure what is going on, geocities is kind of flakey sometimes.  Cheesemonster will probably fix it when he gets a chance.


**EDITED PART**

I just went and checked looked and it seems the main "index" page has been either deleted or lost. I would think that this would be no fun to fix, maybe cheese has it all under control, who knows?

gyah, damn geocities, didnt like the name of the folder that the frames were in, god knows why it decided to do that now. It's workin fine now, keep using www.waypointwarehouse.com if it goes wrong again, cos Ill usually make a temp site and just edit the namedemo protal to the temp site!

You could always use Tripod.com if your having problems. I have a site there and so far, I had NO problems with it being down! :)

Make sure you download CuteFTP from Tripod if you don't have it. It makes updating a BREEZE!;D
