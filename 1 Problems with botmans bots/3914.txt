I have a problem. I undated to adminmod 2.5.5 and don't know where to put my metagame.ini (if it still works). I don't have access to the start command for the server so how do I get the bots loaded? :-(

Perhaps this thread will help...

You will still need the "+localinfo" argument added to the command line when starting the server...

...so if you don't have access to the command that starts the server, you might not be able to get the bots to work.
