I read the thread ".wpt files & Linux dedicated server" and I have the exact same problem. It won´t read the waypoint file (since it doesn´t say calculating... and so on). But it does remove the .wpt file and add the two *.HPB_wp1 and *HPB_wpt files. And I use binary transfer mode when I fpt the waypoint files. 

Any other idea what I can try?

thanks

Which MOD are you running?

You should get one of the following messages on the console...

Incompatible HPB bot waypoint file version!
<mapname> HPB bot waypoints are not for this map!
<mapname> is not a HPB bot waypoint file!

...if you're not getting any of these errors, then the waypoints are loading fine, but there might not be any waypoint paths.

Are you creating the waypoints files yourself or are you downloading them from somewhere?  If you are creating them yourself, make sure the waypoint paths are valid by starting up a Windows server and checking to see that you get the expected waypoint console messages.

Im running cstrike and I don´t get any of the errormessages.

The waypoint files I tried I have downloaded from 2 different places. I also tried a converted waypoint but none of them works.

I tried do start up under windows, but it only crashes.

So, can I make waypoints on a dedicated linux server? And how in that case?

No, you can not create waypoints on a Linux dedicated server.  You can only create waypoints on a Win32 client.

If the waypoints are causing CS to crash on a Windows server then I don't think they will work on a Linux server.

Just delete those waypoint files that you are having problems with.
