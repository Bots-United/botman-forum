I was insipred to make this map after looking at the "Soccer" map that botman told me about at pcgame.com. I just thought that it should have been done with more detail, better grass, more area, etc. 

So here is a re-done version of that map.

There are three teams; blue team, red team, and the yellow team/snipers. The goal of the blue and red teams (both play as civilians) is to get the soccerball into the goal of the enemy team. The only difficult part is traveling across the small field to the goal in the first place, because the angry crowd (yellow team/snipers) are mad that the soccer game turned out to be crap so they are open-firing on all the soccer players.

I would suggest a maximum of 5 players on each team because it might get a little crowded and sometimes everyone tries to respawn at the same time, and with too many players it crashes.

I didnt have time to waypoint it, so if you waypoint it, please send the waypoints to angry_madnow@yahoo.com

You can download it at http://hlsnipingrange.homestead.com/files/tf_soccer.zip

Have fun (this map wasnt meant to be terribly big or detailed, so dont comment on that).
