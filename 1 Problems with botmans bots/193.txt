First, I going to congratulate you, botman, on your HPB bot.  It's the funnest TFC bot I've found, more specifically, it's the only one I've found.
Now for the important stuff.
Q: The only maps with waypoints are all maps for TFC.  Does that mean that the bots can't play HL, OpFor, or CS?  Or just that they don't play as well?
Bug: I have never seen a medic use his crowbar.  I've seen a medic in a position for a bot-vs-bot crowbar fight (I see lots of those), but the medic just stands there, not shooting, not moving, until the other bot clobbers him to death.
Bug: This isn't a bug I've seen recently.  The addbot command will add bots to the 'unassigned' team and they stay there for the rest of the game.  They don't play.
Bug: As you said, 'map' doesn't work.  Neither does 'changelevel', or is it supposed to be that way?
This is neither a question or bug, just a suggestion.  I often see a bot get hung up in a corner or against a wall, or double back to a waypoint behind him then continue on his way, or jump for no good reason, or stand in one spot for a minute or two doing nothing, then continue on.  Yes, I know your working on this.  My suggestion is to work on the navigation code more than the waypoint code (navigation being the bots ability to navigate a level without waypoints, or to navigate between waypoints).  Waypoints are dumb.

I will answer these questions for botman.

Bug1) Medics don't have crowbars!!!
Bug2) Bug will be fixed soon, probably next version, this bug is known to cause problems.
Bug3)Changelevel comes up with a windows error saying sv_getspace(): tried to something or other.

Waypoint Remark: 

Waypoints are the only way for a bot in TEAM FORTRESS to navigate properly, they need to know where capture points/flags etc are and the quickest way to get to them. They work fine. But now because botman has added the waypoint algorithm, the use for the waypoints is endless, you could add tonnes of waypoints if you wish just about everywhere you can go so that the bots willl go everywhere, if that is what you want!

Oh, yeah your right, they don't.  Medics don't have crowbars.
I knew that, but at the time my fingers didn't.

I'll rephrase that bug report for everyone to understand and read.

The medic stands in front of his opponent and gets wopped with another enemie's crowbar over and over again until the medic dies.  This is not smart.  A possible solution would be to have the medic back off (after infecting the opponent, that comes later) and fire away just out of crowbar range.
And another question.  What do two medics both on different teams do at point blank range?  Just stand there?

Thanks for answering my questions, Cheesemonster.  But I still would like Botman to see them.

Yes they stand there, looking into each others eyes.  The hwguys do the same thing they just sit there. I have seen the the hwguys whip out crowbars though when they are out of ammo. Botman, how come the hw's never pull out the shotgun?

Because I haven't had time to fix some of the weapons bugs.

Yes, the HWguy doesn't use the assault cannon correctly.  Yes the snipers don't use the sniper rifle very well.  There are also similar problems with the Half-Life weapon usage (egon gun).

Maybe the medics are just having a discussion about the latest advances in medical technology.  I could swear I see their lips moving when I get close to them!  :)

Well like Botman said in one of his posts the medic's Medikit is the medic's special attack and since the HPB_Bot doesnt know how do use special attacks it just stands there (discussing the new medical technology hehe :D)

Anyways you're doing great work Botman!!! Keep It up...

If you want to get technical the hwyguy's AC is his special "skill".  When you are a player you can select the medikit by merely selecting weapon 1.  They have no problems selecting the crowbar. I guess the game engine sees it differently. I have no knowledge of such things, i am a caveman your world frightens and amazes me. Yes Botman is doing a great job, no one would disagree with that statment.  Keep up the good work!
