I dunno about everyone else but it says I'll need to wait at least an hour just to download any file from the two main fileplanet download sites!

Most of the time I can get small stuff off of my site from one of the alternate fileplanet servers without much wait (5 minutes or less).  It's just the big stuff (10 Megabytes +) that seems to take half an hour or more.
