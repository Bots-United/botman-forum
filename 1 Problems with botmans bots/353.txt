 For some reason they don't say the words you put down in the bot whine text, i have many ideas of what to make them say so tell me its a bug or something im doing wrong

They don't say something very often (I don't want them spamming the console).  I may go back later and make the say percent configurable.  Also bots won't say anything unless they've been alive at least 15 seconds before they get killed.  This is to simulate the amount of time it would take a human player to type in a response after getting killed.  So if your testing phrases, delete all the phrases in the bot_whine.txt (so that your new ones are the only ones) and make sure the bots live at least 15 seconds after respawning, then kill them.  About 10 percent of the time they will send a message from the bot_whine.txt file.

 I tryed all your stuff botman, but did not work but i found out how to get it to work, i was downloading the waypoints for hunted that pizzamonkeyboy made and usually for some reason i have to remove and then install the hpb_bot and then the waypoints work, turns out that its the same with the botwhine thing, maybe you can fix this next version, but i doesn't matter that much,it's not that hard to do, just let ppl know what i told you

If you have an existing HPB installation you will always have use the Remove batch file then the Install batch file to install the new version (either that or copy the HPB_bot.dll and all of the new files to the appropriate places).
