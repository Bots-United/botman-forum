its cool that you added support with the holywars mod! i've noticed that they tend to "get on" the player/opponents heads...  (player stacking) as the bots could'nt reach and hit them... with the jackhammer! 

it seems like they're the saints groupies or praising him! :P

i've noticed that it doesnt have waypoints for the 7 released HW's maps! could've waypointing them would benefit the bots behavior?!?

i would love to waypoint them out! and release them on my website!

Yes, waypoints would help lead them towards weapons, but there are some coding changes needed as well.  Right now the isn't any code that gets the bots to head off toward weapons first and then go look for the saint.  Also I need to implement a JUMP waypoint so that bots can jump when necessary to reach the halo.  Right now the bots will only jump when something is blocking their path.  Also I need to add code so that they know when the halo has spawned and would immediately head towards the halo spawn point.  There is already a FLAG waypoint (for TFC) that can be used to mark the halo spawn point, but again there is no code to get them to head towards this location yet.  These improvements will all be coming in future releases.  Stay tuned.

If you want to create some waypoints for the Holy Wars maps just to see if they are able to get weapons sooner, it shouldn't be that difficult.  Most of the maps are fairly small.  Your work won't be wasted since you should be able to use any existing waypoint files with future versions of the HPB bot.  You'll just need to add additional waypoints later or tag existing points with "WEAPON" or "HALO" or "JUMP" waypoint tags.

you could even add somekind of a personality... that the sinners could frag each other out... when the halo isnt spawned or a saint isnt spawned yet.... just for them not to go run around the map doing nothing.

is there a way for them NOT to "follow the waypoints", specifically!? just like PODbot has a radius thing that gives the bot an area of movement along the waypoints placed on the map. thus making them maneuver around the waypoint loosely or tightly, giving the bots almost human movement.

i also would like starting to code a bot... but i dont know a thing... i just know webdev work!
can you list a steps to take to get started coding? or to code a bot!?

thanks

We're trying the HPBs for Holy Wars and we're very impressed - in fact, we'll probably do the waypoints ourselves and include them into the official package. This might be as soon as beta 2.
