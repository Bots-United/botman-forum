How do you use teamkill for the bots?
I don't know that command. Please tell me!!
This is for Counter-Strike.

You WANT the bots to kill their team mates?  Don't you get enough of that crap playing on Internet servers?

When the bot searches for an enemy just ignore whether the bot and the other player are on the same team or not.

There is no "command" for this.  If you want the bots to kill their teammates you will have to change the code.

All that will do is ALLOW you to shoot your teammates.  Bots still won't target their teammates unless you change the code to make them do so.

what i think he wanted to do was to be able to kill the bots on his own team
maybe for just target practice or something

thats why you set the command to make the bots stupid and just stand there looking at you i find team kill to be just annoying expessially when you get an @$$ hole on there that likes to cap there own players and piss ya off
