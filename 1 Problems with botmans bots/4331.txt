it's really pathetic that no CS bot is actually stable. Podbot, PLbot and even those spectating bots "fakefull" cause serious crashing problems on ever server i've ever created. do your HPB_bots cause CS to crash as well? i know they're extremely stable in TFC, OpFor and normal HL DM but they do they hold up in CS?

i would normaly test it myself but i'm going to bed right now (4am) and i don't want to wake up to find out that my server has been crashing non stop for the past 10 hours. 

to avoid any questions
yes i know they were not meant for CS
yes i know they can't do anything in CS 
yes i know they just run around like idiots, i just want "clients" on the server so people will join.

I don't know if anyone actually uses my HPB bot for a public Counter-Strike server.

When I would do testing with each MOD, I would let the game run overnight to make sure that nothing crashed.  The problem with this is that I'm not testing with lots of people joining and leaving the server.  I didn't have the network bandwidth to allow for a public server to test the HPB bot on.

Some of the problems with stability also have to do with complexity.  The more complex something is, the more it tends to be instability it seems to have.  Since my bots are fairly simple, they tend to be fairly stable.

that simplicity statement of yours puzzles me somewhat. fakefull bots only join as spectators, that's the simplest thing possible yet they are so unstable that a server running them will crash every 3 hours or less :D

Stability also has to do with the mad skillz of the programmer.

I have mad skillz so my code is mostly stable.  ;D

The only bug I've found so far, and I found it today, in the venerable HPB_bot, lies within your UTIL_GetTeam() function, which most if not every bot programmer should check...
In Counter-Strike, team detection is based on the player skin which is read from the infobuffer...
code:

      if ((strcmp(model_name, "terror") == 0) ||  // Phoenix Connektion
          (strcmp(model_name, "arab") == 0) ||    // old L337 Krew
          (strcmp(model_name, "leet") == 0) ||    // L337 Krew
          (strcmp(model_name, "artic") == 0) ||   // Artic Avenger (bug here)
          (strcmp(model_name, "guerilla") == 0))  // Gorilla Warfare
      {
         return 0;
      }
      else if ((strcmp(model_name, "urban") == 0) ||  // Seal Team 6
               (strcmp(model_name, "gsg9") == 0) ||   // German GSG-9
               (strcmp(model_name, "sas") == 0) ||    // UK SAS
               (strcmp(model_name, "gign") == 0) ||   // French GIGN
               (strcmp(model_name, "vip") == 0))      // VIP
      {
         return 1;
      }


...and you just forgot a 'c' to arCtic, botman 8)

Nope.  I didn't forget, Gooseman forgot.

I originally had it as "arctic" (the way it should be spelled) and it wasn't finding those team members!  Take a look in the CS models folder at the 'artic' model.

Doooooh!

Nevermind, I'm confused.  Yes, that model name is not correct.  It should be (and always has been "arctic").

The bug doesn't show up because UTIL_GetTeam() returns 0 by default when it can't find a match.  If it could find a match for "arctic", it would also return 0.

So, it's a bug, but the side effect is the same.  :)
