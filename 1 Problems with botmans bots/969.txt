If you think you have seen a cheat in action, tell valve, or report it to these guys, I found this list interesting and have seen quite a few of these bugs myself and i am glad that they are working on fixing them.

Ive never heard of that cheat. Maybe it was just a glitch?

The worst cheat Ive ever seen online was from a Pyro. Somehow, he managed to kill me with his crowbar in one hit everytime he used it. It must have been some sort of glitch, because thats not possible.

Of course. Why admit how he cheated, when he can get away with it. Sounds like to me he was using a modified noclip cheat.

What will they think of next?

it could be a game hacker program which freezes memory locations such as the number of mirvs he had.

Yes, I think I did.  I think that thread got WAY the heck off topic and so I deleted it (sometime before Christmas if I remember correctly).

By the way since this thread doesn't have anything to do with bots, I'm going to lock it.
