botman, i put a pipe in my bot_whine.txt (i had it representing the middle finger like this -- {*_*},,l,, yabb don't do pipe's so i had to substitute hehe). It drove me crazy! I'd get so far into a game then crash! I did see the bots use it, but i think it's what was cuaseing me to crash? Cuz when i removed it, TFC no longer crashed. Dunno.. It was bad enough trying to get the new video card working corectly (and it's still weird but i got it pretty good, but i think it should be working alot better then what it is .. The video card that is). Anyways, just something i had wanted to ask you. ;)

I modified the HPB bot 4.1a source to send bot whine messages 100% of the time and modified the bot_whine.txt file to have just a few messages with the vertical bar (pipe) and I didn't have any problems with this.  Here's a screen shot of my messages in PUSH...

That is cool! In that pic. It's like they where actually talking to eachother!

You sure this wasn't a bot game? Or can the bots actually talk to eachother now, by using this  simbol?
