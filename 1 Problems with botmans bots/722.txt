My most played map in TFC that i enjoy the most is hunted! Well quite a few times while trying to protect the hunted (or just messin around), i would blast him ahead to try and speed him up + get him out of the way of some sniper fire. Well i downloaded 4.1, Then joined a game of hunted and shot at the hunted,, he went pretty far forward ONLY this time he didn't turn around to catch the couple or so waypoints that he missed.
Man that's GREAT! So i then tried a couple bodyguards, same thing!! They don't mind being blasted ahead now! There like more relaxed!

All i can think of is the mid 60's tv episode of the batman tune and reverse it to Da Na Na Na BOTMAN! ;D
