should really go into developers section, more ppl might be able to help ya :-)

usually a getspace error is an overflow of somesort, I used to get it a lot when I played QUAKE 1 with supreme mods with supreme super weapons, smoetimes when I try to kill that oldone thing at the end with a BFG :-) It crashes and I get that error. It happens a lot with Rocket Crowbar (Mod for HL) If too many ludicrous things happen :-)

Looking at the "uninitialized" part of the message, I guess there may be something like a variable or constant that wasnt defined somewhere, thats only my guess and I'm not at all great at coding either :-(
