hey whats up great site by the way love the bots. I`m dl several waypoints for my bots but where do you put the files for the waypoints at. Is there a special folder or something. I`ve looked at all your linked sites and no one explains how to load them up. Thanks for your help and keep up the good work on the bots.

The waypoint files (.wpt or .HPB_wpt) go in the maps folder for the MOD (i.e. Half-Life\tfc\maps)
