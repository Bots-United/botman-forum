In order to add bots on a dedicated server, you have to have a bot that supports dedicated servers.  This requires separate code that creates a CVAR to execute a command or requires that the bot DLL code create a new server command.

If the bot supports dedicated servers it should be clearly indicated in the ReadMe.txt file that comes with that bot.

For the HPB bot the dedicated server command is...

bot "addbot <model> <name> <skill>"

...where the double quotes are required if you are supplying a model name, a player name and/or a skill level.

Do you know if Vampire Slayer supports method you stated? I'm looking for a way to say make a bot.cfg file that loads at map start.

You'd have to check the documentation for the bot you are using for Vampire Slayer.  Is it Akimbot?

There info says "The Bots have been developed using Bot Man's BotSDK" 

It also lists the following for console:
The add bot console command
vsbot add {team[vampire|slayer]} {class[fatherd|molly|louis|edgar|nina]} {name} {skill[0-5]}
eg. 
vsbot add
vsbot add pinback
vsbot add pinback vampire
vsbot add fatherd pinback 3

But I use hlserver and I'm looking for a way to start bots by a cfg file with unique names and such. Toyed with many but cant get it to make bots the way I want.
