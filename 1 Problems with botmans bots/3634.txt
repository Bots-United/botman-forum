Download the Monster plugin for metamod.  Download and install metamod (see the ReadMe.txt file in the Monster plugin for details on installing metamod and the Monster plugin).

Start your server up, verify that metamod is running (see the Monster ReadMe.txt file).  Verify that the Monster plugin was loaded (see the Monster ReadMe.txt file), then spawn monsters by using the "monster" command (See the Monster ReadMe.txt file).

If you have problems, see the Monster ReadMe.txt file.

The ReadMe.txt file explains the syntax of the "monster" command.  You have to tell it which monster you want to spawn and which player you want to spawn it next to.

You can only spawn monsters that have been precached.  Any monsters that are in the Monster .cfg file (see the ReadMe.txt file) will automatically be precached.  If you don't have a monster .cfg file for that map, you will need to create a monster_precache.cfg file (or edit the one included in the monster .zip file).  Again the ReadMe.txt file explains all of this.

RTFM.

RTFM...

LMAO!

And if you're looking for a little easier way to spawn the bots (and you have admin_mod installed) try my admin interfaces for MONSTER.

Don't ask for support on my files on this forum though (since I can see it coming) email me or post on my site if you have questions about the files at my website.
