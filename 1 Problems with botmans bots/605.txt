I added a few bots into valve's boot_camp map, and all they do is run around.  I can walk up to them and kill them.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks.... Gary

Maybe you need to uninstall Half-Life, reinstall it, patch it up to 1.1.0.4 and try the bots again.  Otherwise I don't know (unless you used "botdontshoot 1" to stop the bots from shooting).
