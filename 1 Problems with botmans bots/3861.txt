I run a TFC server that just runs Dustbowl (tfc.xactamundo.com)  Here is the situation,  I was running the server on Win32, but I have now switced to run on Linux.  I did install the bots with the install script.  I am running metamod, hlguard and HPB bots.  In the HPB_bot.cfg I have 

min_bots 0
max_bots 2
addbot 2 3
addbot 1 3

I only want 2 (soldier) bots on and then when people join have them drop off.  What is happening is wierd, when I first start the game it works great 1 bot per team etc,  but if someone joins it is inconsitant if the bots drop off, sometimes they do sometimes they dont. Another wierd thing is that when the map changes the bots go to the same team.  I have tried a dustbowl_HPB_bot.cfg also but the bots still seem to not read the bot config file?  It also seems that the max_bots param is ignored also when the map changes.  I have had 2 players on and 3 bots at one point.

Any help would be great, thanks in advance.

"Another wierd thing is that when the map changes the bots go to the same team."

The HPB_bot.cfg file is only read ONCE when the first map is loaded.  If you have a map specific bot .cfg file, it will get read and used when that new map is loaded.  If you don't have a map specific bot .cfg file, any bots that were still in the game when the previous map ended will be added at the start of the next map and they will choose a random team.

If you always want 1 bot on each of 2 teams and you always want them to be soldier class, you will have to create a map specific bot .cfg file for each map that you run on your server.  See the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file for the details on creating a map specific .cfg file.

I'm not sure about your problem with the bots not leaving the server when players join.  You only need to set "min_bots" and "max_bots" once (at the start of the first map).  These values will be preserved when maps change (unless you change them in the map specific bot .cfg file in the event that you want to run more bots in some maps and fewer bots in other maps).
