Gamespy (fileplanet.com) seems to dork up their servers every once in a while.  Usually several hours (or several days) later everything is back up and working again.

If you can't download, wait a few hours and try again or wait a few days and try again.

The only ones that ever work for me are italy and ftp2, and ftp2 doesn't always work so hot. Then again neither does italy.
