Hi guys, i`m just wondering about how to create waypoints. Well, the thing is that the command "waypoint on" is not recognized by CS1.6. I`m pretty sure i`m doing something wrong but i also tried developer 1 and still nothing. How am i supposed to create waypoints? Does someone know?

I'm not sure CS coders have not removed cool stuff like the temporary entities we use to draw beams (and to display waypoints) to prevent cheats to use them. If it's the case, many bots will have to rewrite their waypoint editor.

I wish I had CS 1.6 to do some tests.
