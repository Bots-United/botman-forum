When I load a level with the bots, like for example 2fort. After 5 minutes of playing, the game crashes! I dunno how to fix it. I even did a reinstall cause it was crashing 5 seconds right after the level showed up.

I found out it was a problem in bot.cfg But I dunno what could be causing this.

Somebody please help me!

What error message do you get when Half-Life crashes?  Are you able to use other bots (like in Counter-Strike or Firearms) without similar problems?

I don't get an error. It just crashes. It closes Half-Life out and goes back to the desktop. That's what I mean by it "crashing." Also I don't have CS, or Firearms. I do have OP4 though. Haven't tried it, since the crashing, though.

Usually when Half-Life (or MODs) crash, Half-Life will report the type of error that caused the crash.  If the application just terminates with no error message, there may be other problems with the operating system (i.e. Windows).  Do you have problems with any other applications crashing (Internet explorer, Netscape, other games, etc.)?

Maybe there's a problem with one of the system DLL files or possibly a virus.  Since you've already uninstalled and reinstalled Half-Life, doing that again probably won't help.  The only other solution I can think of is to wipe out your hard disk and reinstall Windows (yeah, I know it's a pain, but I have to do that myself at least once a year).

I WAS having a problem with IE, but that's fixed now. I wonder if that could of pointed to TFC terminating.

I use AOL (Alot Of Lag) 5.0, and IE 5, which came with AOL.

IE wasn't crashing, just not connecting right. It's like, Half-Life is VERY unstable on my computer, just like DOS! :-)

Also, I didn't reinstall Half-Life, I reinatalled the HPB Bot.

I have a 500 mhz With 128 MG of RAM. A ATI Rage Pro, and a Voodoo 2 card.

Ok, this is what's going on so far with the "crash" .......

I've decided to reinstall Half-Life. And I went to get the update, but I can't. Cause the SIGS Automated Update currently is not available for AOL, and several others! 

This sucks! Now I can't even MAKE the bot work, without the update.

When one of the testers of my bot plays a game with 31 bots, it also sometimes crashes. I don't know the couse of this.

My HL also crashes a lot, it happened on these maps, HUNTED, BETRAYED, BASKETBALL and FLAGRUN... I need help too, the same thing happened all the time, Half-life just quit to the desktop, although the hard disk read a bit first. This mostly happened when I died or a bot died or maybe when i was in spectator, these  could be the possible causes somehow...

That's the SAME thing that was happening to me, Cheesemonster! But I reinstalled Half-Life, the patch, and Half-Life hasen't crashed ..... yet!

I thought it could of been the fact I added too many phrases in the bot_whine.txt file. Or messed up the Bot.cfg file. Or added too many bots for one game, and the CPU couldn't handle it. Or maybe too many levels. Maybe one of the levels had a bug in it, and it caused the "crash". I dunno.

Ares,

Will you tell me why there is a file called settings.scr, in your abot.zip.  That is not cool dude.  Not to be an alarmist, but until he explains this.  BE CAREFUL!

Kevin, that file is for the mp_<whatever> cmds.
Either ARES, accidently put in there or he modifiyed the file so it adds/removes something so the bots would work, i would not know unless i go dload it and look.  I would go dload it and try them out, but one i do not know the link to get them, two, im trying to get my copy of op4 to work with the botmans bots. I go to select a team and i select and then "where's half-life", no error, nothing, but it could also be due to some patch i missed or something

I am still not touching it, i am a hardware/software tech and i have seen files with the scr extension start showing up just about the same time viruses do, i am not saying he did that.  I am just not touching it till i know what it does. Thats just me though, call me paranoid. Also, why is there no uninstall program?

Botman what is this file?
Why is it in tfc?
and why is it the same extension as a screen saver?

Why does it share the same extension as a screen saver?
Why does it come in TFC?

I've been wandering that myself. I saw that file. I thought it was a Windows screensaver, about how to set up the HPB Bot.

"settings.scr" is the file used by Half-Life to store the options you select in the "Advanced options" in the "Create game" menu.  It's just a text file with settings like mp_footsteps, mp_flashlight, etc.  It just happens to have the same file extension as Windows screen savers, but it's not a screen saver and it's not a virus.

People shouldn't really include the settings.scr with their zip files unless the MOD requires it (which bots shouldn't require it).  It won't hurt anything to have it, but it may change some of your settings (like round limit time, or whether footsteps are on or off, etc.).  Before creating a game, go into the advanced options menu and check to make sure things are set they way you want.  When you exit that menu, Half-Life will save these back to the settings.scr file.

Thank goodness, I just thought it suspiscious.  Didn't want to scare anyone, i just found it curious.  I personally have seen a few screen savers that were viruses.  I was actually stupid enough to install one, one time. Thats why i was worried when i saw that file in there. Thanks Botman. So Ares, why is that file in there anyway?

I think that's your machine.  Wipe out your disk, re-install Windows, re-install Half-Life, apply the necessary upgrades, install the HPB bot and you will probably find your crashing problem goes away.

Sorry for anwsering so late.

The .scr is for the settings you can change in the advanced option menu. settings such as the bots skill level and the auto even teams option.
You can see a picture of the menu on my page.
The .scr is no virus.

ok, i've been working with the code a bit, i think the crash is witht he 2.1 update.  Simply put, CS closes without any error message right about the time you go to select a team.  It doesn't happen when i comment out the new code botman said to add for the 2.1 "fix".  I've narrowed the problem down to inside the 
if(prev_time <= gpGlobal->time)
statement.  But even then i had a problem with getting more then one bot to join the game.  I had to remove the declaration of prev_time in the bot_t struct to get everything bakc to normal.  hope this helps

If you are using MingW32 to build your bot, did you do "make clean", then "make" to rebuild all the object files?  If not this can cause problems because the makefile for MingW32 doesn't have dependancy rules set to to rebuild the .cpp files when the .h files change.

When changing a .h file it's always best to do a "make clean" followed by a "make".
