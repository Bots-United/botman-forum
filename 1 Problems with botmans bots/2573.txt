Hi Botman
Just installed BOT10.
Works brilliantly with standard Half Life.
Congratulations - BUT
I am having NO JOY with Death Match Classic.
Is there some magic command line I must use
or some sort of special config file.
Nutty

I think only the HPB bot has support for MODs. Download botman's HPB bot and enjoy bots in DMC...
