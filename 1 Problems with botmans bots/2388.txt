Just wondering if i could get a heads up on what to change in the stripper sdk to make it work for my mod. it has very few changes from the original sdk at the moment, i haven't removed any weapons or changed the dll's drastically. 

any thoughts?

Just modify the list of entities in the linkfunc.cpp file, rebuild the DLL and you're done.

This is done....but when i run the install.bat (I've changed it to point to my mod directory) and then run the game, my mod crashes...no error, just quits out. You can get all the way to where the server is supossed to start (Console comes up) then it quits

Any tips on how to fix this?

Run it in Debug mode to see where it's crashing.
