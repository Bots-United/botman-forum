I was looking around for some POD Bot WPT files and came across this website.
http://www.botmaster.de.vu/

And found this

"On these pages you can find the Bot-Master 2000 Version 5.0 by Boris Niedetzky. This application helps you to easily manage your Bots for Counter-Strike. Single Bots can be installed and removed (All Bots and Waypointfiles are included). Further you can create Bot-Configurations to join all Bots for a map by one command or join them directly at the beginning of a map.

Features of the Bot-Master 2000

-Change any (also hidden) server settings
-Setting the sequence for mapcycle
-All Bots and Waypointfiles are included in their newest release
-Easy installation and removal of Bots
-Simple creation of Bot-Configurations for all popular CS-Bots
  (AGBBot, Android, BobaBot, HPB Bot, NNBot, Rambot, Realbot, SWAT Bot)
-Automatically run Bot-Configurations (if supported by the used Bot)
-Set up your custom spraylogo
-Save and load complete Counter-Strike-Configurations
-Possibility to run Counter-Strike directly and with parameters "

Its really weird but it seems like this guy made the Bot Master before you.

I mean its called Bot Master 2000 

Would you take the Bot Master 5000 source code and make a Bot Master 2000 ? 

However the site only seems to have been updated on the 29th of the 7th.

Oddly enough the same day you realeased the Bot Master 5000.

Pherhaps he took the source code. Pulled out the TFC stuff and put it up on his page.
He could just have said it was Version 5 to make people think it was older than yours.

That's kind of weird.  The oldest stuff I can find on their webpage is in the forum (July 8th, 2001).  Why wouldn't it have been called "Bot Master 2001"?

This project seems very similar to Fred's MBL project.  I wonder why they created this since Fred has had his project out for so long?  It doesn't look like it does anything much different from MBL.

"Would you take the Bot Master 5000 source code and make a Bot Master 2000 ?"

Nah, I really don't want to do a "bot launcher" type application.

My BotMaster5000 just allows you to run multiple bots.  The Bot Master 2000 only allows you to launch a single type of Counter-Strike bot after setting up the configuration for that game.

Obviously the BotMaster5000 is 2.5 times better than the Bot Master 2000 (2000 x 2.5 = 5000). ;D

[update:] I went searching on www.google.com for "botmaster" and found some older references to Bot Master 2000 all the way back to April, 2001 (but nothing before that).  The April, 2001 reference was from a German Counter-Strike news website that mentioned a 3.x release of Bot Master 2000, so apparently Bot Master 2000 must have been around since sometime last year (hence the 2000 in the name).

I wonder if I should change the name since people might get confused, although I'd never heard of Bot Master 2000 until I went searching for it.  I don't ever remember it being mentioned on any of the Half-Life related web sites that I visit (not even Bot Epidemic which usually has just about everything bot related).

Oh well I was getting confused when it said it would work with all those bots.
This is just a Bot Launcher. 

I guess the name is fine. No one else knows about this anyway do they :P

I only found it by accident
