I am trying to set the fraglimit on my Linux server via the command line when I start hlds_run, but when the frag limit is reached, the next map is not loaded.

Any suggestions?

Are you setting these in your server.cfg file?  I don't think changing them after the map loads will have any effect (until the end of the second map).

OK...the frag limit works now (I was trying to do it command line), but the map cycle isn't working right.  It tries to load the map hldm1 and it can't find it.  The map is not in my maps directory and it's not in my mapcycle.txt file either.  Where is this coming from?

thanx for your help!

Are you looking at the mapcycle.txt file in your MOD directory or in the valve directory (they are the same if you're just running Half-Life deathmatch)?  It's got to be coming from a mapcycle.txt file somewhere.

for some reason the mapcycle.txt file is not being parsed.  The hlds_run is getting the map hldm1 from somewhere and it's not in a mapcycle.txt file.  I grepped for hldm1* and it came up empty.  Is it possible that is't hard-coded somewhere?

HELP!!!

No map names are hard coded into Half-Life deathmatch.  Which MOD are you running (or is it Half-Life deathmatch)?

Show the command line you are using to start Half-Life...

hlds_run ? ? ? ? ?

here's my HPB_bot.cfg file (minus leading comments):

# wait for 3 seconds
pause 3

# change default bot skill level to 2
botskill 3

# Remove the comments on the 2 lines below to support a minimum and maximum
# number of bots running on a dedicated server.  Bots will be added to the
# server until the total number of players (bots and humans) reaches the
# max_bots value.  Each time a new player joins the server, a bot will be
# kicked from the server unless there are only min_bots number of bots
# currently on the server.  After players disconnect from the server, bots
# will be automatically added back to the server until the total number
# of players reaches max_bots again.  You should make max_bots be AT LEAST
# one less than the maxplayers value (otherwise no one will be able to join
# your server).

#min_bots 2
#max_bots 6

addbot 
addbot 
addbot 

mapcyclefile 1

mp_flashlight 1

mp_fraglimit 20

mp_timelimit 10

Is there a specific format that the mapcycle.txt file needs to be in for this MOD?  I am using my old Jumbot mapcycle.txt that contains the map names only.  I think that's how they all work.

My maps are located in the .../valve/maps directory.

This is the error I get when it attemps to change maps:

changelevel failed: 'hldm1' not found on server.

Thanx for your help!

make a listenserver.cfg file and put server commands in it

I have no idea what this is...

mapcyclefile 1 

...try removing that from your .cfg file.

...from the command.pdf file that I looked at the "mapcyclefile" command specifies the file NAME of the mapcycle file you want to use.  The default is "mapcycle.txt".  So if you wanted to change it you could have...

mapcyclefile my_mapcycle.cfg

...or something similar, but not "1".

GOT IT!!!  It's working now.  I'm not sure what the problem was, but it seems to be happy now.  I probably had a typo in a config file.

thanx for everyone's help!
