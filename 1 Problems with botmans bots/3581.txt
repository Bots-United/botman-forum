Which download do I pick for windows? The single DLL, or the source and binaries?

I'm not going to edit anything, I want to play that Monster plugin. It looks cool and hopefully it'll keep me from getting too bored waiting for an enemy to try and take my flag, they'll be too busy getting killed by the monsters to mess with me. [grins]

You need the .zip file with the DLL...
