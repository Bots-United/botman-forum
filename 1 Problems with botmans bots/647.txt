Is it possible to delay the bots to the extent of the human nervoussystem and lets say 100 worth of ping? it doesnt feel right when they get instant aim and shoots your brain out the sec the spot you
dunno how hard that is to code but if it would take too much of your precius time dont bother (im not being ironic)

Cheat?
no not exactly but i thought the whole idea about bots was to simulate humans. i would not say that its very human to get instant aim and keep it no matter what the person do bunnyjumping etc.
