I posted this on the Sierra board:

I'm using the Linux server version 1103. 

I have tried: 

placing mp_teamplay 1 in the command line; NO LUCK 

starting server with no map, then typing in mp_teamplay 1, then starting a map; NO LUCK 

placing mp_teamplay in the server.cfg; NO LUCK 

I also have HPB_bot beta 4 installed; I noticed that when the console confirmed that mp_teamplay was 1, the bots using my model weren't shooting at me, but the teams weren't showing up on the game screen. The player list still looked like regular deathmatch.

I had to set the mp_teamlist to be "hgrunt;scientist" on my machine to get the bots to work properly in teamplay on OpFor.
