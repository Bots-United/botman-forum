First, I'd like to say that I am running HPB_bot and stripper2 and love both. Any problems I've had with these programs has always been due to my own ignorance in installing or configuring them. 

Well, I've set up some waypoints for my HPB bots using BSP_tool on some of the maps I'm running. I would like to join my dedicated server and watch the bots and make sure they're using the waypoints like I want them to. But I don't want them noticing me or shooting at me. I was told to put "sv_cheats 1" into server.cfg and "-dev" into my server shortcut, then join my server, open the console and type in "notarget". Well I did all that and the bots were -still- attacking me. How can I accomplish this? 

(I'm running AdminMod with HPB bot).

You can keep them from shooting at you by entering...

observer 1

...in the console.  You can turn this off by using "observer 0".  You can keep the bots from shooting at anything (and just wandering around) by entering...

botdontshoot 1

...in the console.  You can turn this off by using "botdontshoot 0".

P.S. If you're running this from a dedicated server those would be...

HPB_bot "observer 1"
HPB_bot "botdontshoot 1"

...or...

rcon "HPB_bot observer 1"
rcon "HPB_bot botdontshoot 1"
