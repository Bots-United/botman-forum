Botman, remove the lamer,
I post naked women

Is it a bot? It looks like one, or is it a mentally disturbed person?

No, just a dumbass.  I banned all (most?) of the IP addresses he was using.

Well... I guess not as long as I don't have to look at it at the end of every single message thread.

It does take longer to download the thread with animated gifs in them.  Especially if it's a long thread with lots of people using animated signatures.

Just use your best judgement and if it becomes a problem you'll get a warning.  If problems continue you'll get IP banned.  If you find a new IP then I'll ban that one too.  :)

If you ban all the ip addresses he is using, then wont some of the other users be afftected
(a user is assigned an ip address dynamically by its isp, unless they apply for a static one)
