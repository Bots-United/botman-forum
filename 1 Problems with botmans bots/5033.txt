Alright so I started making my first bot for SI that recently got updated. Noone plays the mod I decided I'd make some bots for all the guys that want to play but can't because of stupid crap involving no servers. OK, so I find out all the LINK entities that needed to be defined and defined them. I set the mod path to si\dlls\si.dll (in code was si\\dlls\\si.dll). So I put that in the dlls folder tell the liblist.gam file to load sibot.dll which is what i named the dll and set the file to read only since I'm running on steam. As soon as I pick the map and press start it freezes and I get the error message "ModName: Unknown" or something close to that. I'm sure there is something stupid I probably did wrong so a little push in the right direction would be great.
