Hello,

    I play the bot, but I got into making some neat Waypoints for some maps, I worked on Openfire and got them to get flag and return it, but I have a question..
     I get the error that reads:
A FATAL ERROR EXCEPTION OE HAS OCCURED AT  0028:BFF88112.
THE CURRENT APPLICATION WILL BE TERMINATED

     This seems to mostly happen when I edit waypoints for a map, or should I say, it has happened everytime I have edited waypoint file for a map.  And I can't figure it out.  I would appreciate any help from anyone.  I was playing with Worldcraft, but I doubt that was the problem, because I always edit maps, and it has never done that before.  Only when I go to edit waypoint files.  Thanks.-Silent~Sniper_King

Clearing the CMOS might help!  Or underclocking your CPU, cos I used to get lots of errors like this, becuase my CPU was supposadly too fast for the motherboard bec....... I'll stop there :)

I have noticed when i make waypoints.  If i make too many on a certain map, the next time i go to play the map, it won't open.  I guess i was just making the waypoint files too large.  It was a real b*tch trying to make cz2 without having that happen.  I doubt this is the same problem but maybe it is, who knows.  Would you happen to be overclocking?

You are allowed to create 1024 waypoints in a map.  You should NOT edit waypoints in a map while bots are on the server.  Kick all of the bots off of the server first and then edit the waypoints, save the waypoint file, and reload the map.

Botman, I modify waypoints all the time with bots in game, i do this so i can see how they move about with the waypoints where they are.  I also have not got a crash like that.

I will try that, but first I am going to try not even edit waypoints, I want to see if that was the problem, only when I edited it, I got the blue screen with the error.  But not when I don't edit.  Thanks.

The path information (paths between waypoints) are only calculated and stored when the map is loaded.  If you add waypoints after that (with bots in the game), they will not make use of the new path information until the map is reloaded and the waypoint paths are recalculated.  Deleting waypoints from the level (while bots are in the game) can lead to crashes.

Maybe in my next release I will automatically kick all bots out of the level when a waypoint is added or deleted.  That will prevent the crashing problem.  Or I guess I could just print a message telling you that waypoints can't be added or deleted while bots are in the game.

that sounds good to me. I like the kicking idea, instead of a msg

I think a message would be better. Cause, why go through all of that script work, just to kick a bunch of mindless, waypoint-following, but 3/4ths the time they don't want to, expasually in avanti, (bots)?
