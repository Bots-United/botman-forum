I think ive said this before ages ago and its happening again, especially in 2fort whenever the bots fall in the water. They keep turning round left and right while swimming on the spot and they don't get anywhere, I think what MAY be causing this is the the path selected by the bot may have been one on the bridge and they cant get up to it, or its simply just me :-(

I was watching them swim around under the bridge (and down into the passageways) on 2FORT for 20 or 30 minutes this past Saturday.  If you only have 1 of them in the water at a time they seem to head on out toward their goal.  If there are several of them in the water at once (on different teams), they just keep attacking each other and everybody usually ends up drowning or getting blown up.

Are you using the 2fort.wpt that comes with the HPB bot or are you using another one?

I don't know what to tell you.  This is probably another one of those weird bugs where things have to happen in the right order to get stuff messed up.

Sometimes I run 2fort before doing a release and the bots handle the water just fine.  Other times they just swim back and forth from one side of the moat to the other and don't go down in the passageways.  I can't seem to figure out why they don't want to follow the waypoints down in the water.  It could be some of the code that prevents them from trying to continue to move in a direction when they think they are stuck, but that shouldn't be happening in the water (at least not when they are in the middle, under the bridge).  Everytime I try to figure out why they won't swim through the passage ways, they won't get stuck.  Then when I'm running without the debugger enabled they decide it's time to swim around in circles.  I think they just like to play games with me and tick me off!

I guess I should just work on trying to get them to not jump in the water in the first place, huh?

What I think, it MAY have something to do with their grenade avoidance code! I think they started doing that with me when grenade avoidance support was added.

Depending on bot skill etc anyway, I think the bots should have different grenade avoidance abilities. And they shouldnt try to avoid teammates grenades if friendly fire isnt on (or mp_teamplay..)

I took my 2fort & removed the pathway going back so that they travel in one direction & can't turn around. Helps me Alot! Because before they usaully just ended up drowning. Oh, but i also Team Specified the waypoint above each tunnel, so Reds tunnel will only have Blue Team go in & Blue Tunnel only have Red Team swim through. Yup the bots sometimes when they have flag and get blown off the bridge will have to druge back through enemy territory, but their troopers and don't mind at all.. hehe 8D .. You know, the only one that i've seen that will actully break the rule of Team Specified waypoints is the soldier, he'll swim right through "And i've made sure in spec mode to remove ALL possible paths".. But that's fine with me, he's suprised me a few times whilst i waited for the medic to come through and give me some healin.

I also did the water waypoints the same in monkey_l .. The HPB does Good, could do better but they make it all the way through 90% of the time. But my monkey_l waypoints need tweeking!
I've done the same in crossover2 also, but since they do fidget like they do (always wanting to turn n twist) they need better health to make it through those long tunnels.. But they have done it!! There's probably like a 30% they might make it.. :D

Yeah, tell them that big Half-Life fish type thing lives in their & they'll get bitten to death if they stray.. 
It would probably be something like this in the code:

pEdict->v.rendermode = kFishMean;
pEdict->v.rendermode = kRenderChomp;
pEdict->v.rendercolor.x = 0;  // red also use to render extra blood! Alert more fish type thingies

debugger - release error? sounds like you forgot some variables do initialize. are you working with visual studio 6? vs6 often has problems with static variables especialy in static functions. in debugemode everything seems allright, in release they often "forget" what value they had... realy strange. no servicepack repairs this bug.

Another reason might be that there's no extra check for 'reachability' of this wpt while swimming or the distance to this wpt is too far away under certain circumstances. At least I know that this broke swimming once in my Bot.
