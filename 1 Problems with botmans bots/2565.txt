why do you get like 10 on one team and 3 on the other? and is there a way to make it fair?

use the command...

addbot 5

that way they'll use the auto-team method.

if you want to change a bot to automaticly do this replace

code:

if (pBot->bot_team == -1)
  pBot->bot_team = RANDOM_LONG(1, 2);



in bot_start.cpp cs team picking code

with

code:

if (pBot->bot_team == -1)
  pBot->bot_team = 5;

The bots will pick random teams when they spawn.  This is because some maps in TFC have 2 teams, some have 3 teams and some have 4 teams.

If you want to always have balanced teams, you can create a map specific bot.cfg file (one bot.cfg file for each map).  You can use "addbot 1", "addbot 2", "addbot 1", "addbot 2", etc. in the map specific bot.cfg files.  See the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file for details on how to create map specific bot.cfg files.
