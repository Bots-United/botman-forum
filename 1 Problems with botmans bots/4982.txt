i tried your headshot mod today.. it's very cool.  one question though - in regular hldm server.. this mod does not work when using a crossbow.  i can shoot someone's legs and get the kill when damage_allow is set to 1 (head).  is this because a zoom shot counts as a headshot or something else?  any insight would be great.  shotgun and pistol, etc, all do no damage unless shot at the head.  thanks.

Ah yes, I see.

It won't work with other types of weapons too.
Typically, it won't work with ANY weapon whose ammunition is NOT a bullet. Because only bullet ammos make players fire TraceLines()... that is, the engine function the plugin hooks for allowing/disallowing the damage.

Hacking the plugin to make it work with other types of weapons is possible but would require insane amount of coding... and I've got plenty of things to do already these times...

But if you're a coder and you want to have a look at it, you may want to catch the Touch() function.

Touch (pentTouched, pentOther)
{
   if (pentTouched == player
       && pentOther == crossbow bolt)
      return (don't call engine function)
}

in pseudocode...

i did some coding in university but since then i've lost most of it =/  oh well, thanks for your help.  i'll still be using the mod for the guns it DOES work for.  thanks!
