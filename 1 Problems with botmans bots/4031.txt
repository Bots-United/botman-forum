I have two questions, is it possible to use maps from one mod with another mod. As an example, could I use de_dust in HLDM for a straigt frag fest, using HLDM weapons. Secondly, is the auto waypointer part of bst_tools any good. Does it make waypoints allowing bots to find flags and capture points, as well as items and sniper spots. Thanks in advance, Joe. BTW, does HPB work with ricochet.

1. Yes, as long as the necessary entities exist such as player spawn points, weapon spawn points, etc.  Even if the map doesn't contain the necessary entities, you can add them yourself using my Stripper2 metamod plugin (after installing metamod first).  See some Half-Life mapping tutorial sites to learn what entities are required for various MODs.

2. The autowaypointer does a pretty poor job of placing waypoints.  If you don't want to manually place them yourself, you can start with a map waypointed by the autowaypointer and delete ones that are in a poor location and add additional waypoints in better locations (for example in the middle of doorways or narrow hallways, etc.).

3. No, the HPB bot does not work with Ricochet.

Where is the Stripper2 plugin for metamod? I wanna use it to disable grenades in some of my fav maps so bots don't grenade spam.

Even with the bot_grenade_time to 60 in HPB_bot.cfg the bots throw a grenade about 4-5 seconds after the first.
