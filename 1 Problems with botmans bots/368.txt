Nope, but as soon at Valve releases CS 1.0, there will definitely be problems.

Because they are going to add new models, new weapons and probably one or two other new entities.  Many of the CS bots use the model name to determine which team a player is on.  Remember what happened when vehicles were added.  The bots that hadn't been modified to support vehicles caused vehicles to dissapear from the levels.
