2) They Get Stuck In Corners and respawn rooms
3) When Being A Engie the bots don;t go after the SG's or Dispencers (although they try to use them, well... walk into them)
4) When being a medic its to easy to get 100's of kills by infecting a member of the opposite team in there repawn room, they pass it on and b4 u know it they all die
5) When me and my bro was playing on LAN on the same team vs loads of bots, i was medic infected the other team and me bro caught the infection from the other team ! and died. maybe it was due to having frenidly file on, but that don;t happen when playing against humans

yes... hmm...

1) They Jump cos you probably have v2.0 get v3.0 now released. They may jump too much cos There are no waypoints near them.

2) They get stuck in respawn cos they like picking up healthkits and armour which they do not need at the moment (Will be sorted out soon i believe)

3) No AI regarding this has been implented to the bot.

4) The bots don't know how to use their special skills i.e cure/infect other bots/humans

5) ...I have no idea at all....

6) The snipers should be given some sort of "spots" or waypoints where they can stop and snipe. They should be given a longer viewing distance andd of course they need to charge up their sniper rifle before shooting for a frag.

7) Yep

8) added mine here: Bots run straight into lasers, they might be able to realise that if they knew what an env_laser was...

9) when there is gas in rock2 the bots will have to be attracted to the protective suits/water/wardens office etc... this can be done with the bots getting attracted to info_tfgoal's or item_tfgoals...

10) I've probably got another thing but I'll say this... the bot has merely started it's debut in TFC and it can't do everything just yet!!!! :-)

more for ya :)

11) Bots ain;t effected by concs, they still got brill aim
12) theres a wicked little trick that u can pull off, it involes feigning death with spy outside respawn room, then all the bots die, heres a link to the demo file that i recorded of it. its only 101k and its good for a laugh
http://wireplayfornewbies.8k.com/dumbbots.zip
if it don't work ICQ or e-mail me and i'll send it over.
13) bots get stuck in water, ALOT
14) HWguys sometimes don;t fire, they just sorta warm up the gun, they ain;t learned that u gotta hold down the fire button
15) Bots like the crowbar, for a stange reason
16) Bots don;t use grenades
17) bots walk straight into pipe bomb traps
18) they don't go after a feinged spy (although that could be annoying if they did everytime)
19) add more here...

With the old alpha 1 source code, i used some code that tells you what player and team a player was, and made the bot shoot at it if it was a player.

Unfortunatly, i made it fire at anything that didn't have a worldspawn classname.

I didn't think to check if the classname was player....

hehe, 
20) ANOTHER bug i found not sure if it's still in this new version but on the map PUSH the bots used to gather in the corner and fire up at where the camara is when u join a game, when u choose team and class and that, if u know where that is ?

anyway they just stand there firing up at it untill there was bout 4 of my team stood there shooting up at nothing.

Tracelines are the best way to detect players (well, thats what i think, anyway)


I used the "who am i pointing at?" tutorial code from the Half-life Programming Planet, and modified it for use with the bot.

It was quite funny when the bot kept shooting at the walls (unfortunate coding error), shouting medic(i made them do that when there health was low) and dieing, but not respawning(must have been some strange bug, as i also noticed that only 1 bot spawned)

With tracelines ( there are other methods ), you could just send one out from the bots position, and make it hit a wall( if it didn't, the bot would shoot at the wall )
If it hit a player, it would check its teamname, etc and possibly shoot it.
If, however, it was a lader, then the bot could walk towards it :-)

With tracelines, you can make them the bots "eyes"

If you want to make the bot build an sg, make
it send a command like "build 2" to the server...
