After you download the HPB bot .exe file, run it and extract the files to your Half-Life folder (where hl.exe is located).  This will create a HPB_bot folder inside the Half-Life folder.  Use Windows Explorer to browse to the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder and read the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file.   It will explain how to install the bot, how to change the number of bots and how to change the skill level of the bots.
