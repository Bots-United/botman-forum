Botman,

I got 4.2a (linux version) installed and running last night at around 6:30p PST. It's now about 8:30 am and still not one crash. Seems quite stable to me. I will keep checking on it from time to time and let you know how it's going. 14 hours is pretty darn good though.

I like the improvements too. Notice less crowbar fights (one of the most annoying things from before), the bots drop grenades when they die (taking out their attacker) and the medic coming when called is wonderful and funny at the same time. I only played about an hour and a half last night so not a lot of feedback from in game, just wanted to tell you that it's not crashing on me. One thing I did notice which is not really a big deal is that the medic sometimes won't leave you alone after you call him. He had charged me up to 155 health (whatever max is) and just kept filling me up. I even ran away and he followed me around. This only happened a couple times though and more times than not he just filled to 100% and ran off.

I can see the clq ratings improving from this. And once you get the sg part done these bots are REALLY going to rock. I can hardly wait for your next release. Like others said, though, take your time. Get better. And can I have it tomorrow? j/k.

No need to respond, botman. Just an FYI for you. Thought I would comment since there seems to be alot of people talking about it crashing their systems. Alls fine on the Linux side.

"I got 4.2a (linux version) installed... and still not one crash."

Yes, like I said I've never had any reports where the Linux version crashed.  I've never seen the HPB bot releases crash on my Win32 box at work or at home (of course I also uninstall and reinstall Half-Life at least every other month when other problems start to occur).  I've downloaded everything from www.fileplanet.com and burned all of the upgrades and latest versions of MODs on a CD and just install stuff off of that.

Several people have reported problems with the HPB bot crashing but I can't reproduce these problems.  If I can't reproduce the problem then I can't fix it.  I don't know if the problem is related to a specific video card, Windows version, DLL conflict, or possibly corrupted files in the Half-Life or Widows\system directory.  Usually when Half-Life crashes back to the desktop with no dialog error box there is a problem with Windows DLL files, video drivers, and/or Half-Life files.

I noticed this problem too but didn't have time to track down why he wouldn't leave you alone.  They are supposed to stop "attacking" you when your health gets to 100%.  I had briefly considered changing this to stopping after you get to 120% or more, but never went back and changed this.  Somewhere it's not getting the correct health percentage for the player it's healing or for some reason isn't checking the health percentage in the place that it is supposed to.  I guess it's not a major problem, but it is kind of annoying.

That medic thang, 'taint really a prob. One thing that came to mind is that they might be getting health percent from another player who is NOT at 100%. So they keep attacking. Just a thought.

Oh, still no crashes :o)

And the "rcon bot addbot" seems to work every time now! (knocks on wood)

Hey, Brian, have you upgraded your Linux server to version 3.1.0.5? If not, you can find it at fileplanet.com.

Actually I just realized I'm still using 3.1.0.4

What's new and exciting in 3.1.0.5?

BTW, hlds_run has be up for 61 hours straight now. 61:16:54 to be exact. No crashes since the hpb_bot upgrade.
