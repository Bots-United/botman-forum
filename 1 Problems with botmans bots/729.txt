I say your post the other day, the one with the link to your site.

I never knew there was cheat for hl....
Anyway, I don't understand how to implement these cheats in HL, oh and when you say cheats for hl, you do mean hl the game don't you, not hl deathmatch.

One last thing, if I am meant to type the cheats in the console when actually in the game... then I have a bigger problem, cause for some reason my console dosen't seem to work at all no matter where I try it.

I saw your post. And I'm happy to try to help you out!

Ok, the 1st thing you need to do, is bring down your console in Half-Life. You can do this by hitting your tide, or ~ key. Which is usually the key on the left of the 1 key on a 101 Standard Keyboard. 

If your having trouble trying to bring the console down, I would recomend you .... um.... reinstall Half-Life, and the upgrade. But be SURE you removed ALL traces of the game! Meaning, all files, directories, EVERYTHING that's Half-Life related. Just, not your site.

If it STILL won't come up, then I dunno what to tell you. The next thing I would say, is reformat your hard drive that Half-Life is on.

If you DO manage to get your console to work, you need to 1st type in: sv_cheats 1

This will activate ALL cheats. Now the simple ones, are as follows.

god: typing "god" without the quotes in the console will make you invinciable to ALL attacks!

notarget: typing this will cause the ailens, and grunts not to notice you.

I would recommend you go to planethalflife.com for more info on the console. And for more cheats.

Or, go to my Half-Life page, and look for "Cheat Codes"

I hope this answeres your question!

I'm having a problem myself with FLF, ever since the HPB Bot BETA 4.1 upgrade, When I ran FLF. The 1st time I tried to capture a point, it ternimated on me. CS, TF, and HL are working though. I'm afraid I'm gona have to reinstall Half-Life myself. But all of that %*&%*^* work! Plus, having to get all of my customised files, and wad's out of there before I do reinstall it. As long as CS, TF, and HL work, I just rather live with it! LOL!

to activate console go to sierra\halflife\tfc\config.cfg file and make sure these two lines are there

bind "~" "toggleconsole"
console "1.0"

that should do it!
