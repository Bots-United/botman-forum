This problem likely is not the bot but probably human error on my part or an error within the game.  Just installed opposing force since i've not played it in the year or two that i've owned it and decided to get me a good bot since my ping sucks.  

I normally only play cs and use count floyds pod 2.0 with it so i figured hpb bot would be best for me using opposing force.  I don't know if i've got it set up wrong or what but here is the problem:

I start opposing force and it adds the desired number of bots just fine but wether or not i have team play enabled the bots ignore each other and me as if they are on the same team.  In addition each time i kill a bot i get penalized as if for a TK.  

Example-I'm listed as being on the grunt team against the scientist team but nobody is killing anyone and when i frag a scientist i get a minus one frag.  When i check the console it says i just killed a teammate.  They still ignore each other even when i have no teams set up.

I know this is most likely due to my having no knowledge of opposing forces and not anythign to do with the bot but i've scoured the net for documentation to help me but to no avail.  It appears there are no instructions for hosting opposing force or getting the teams or whatever set properly.  Can somebody help me plz?

Yes, I had that problem with teams also.  You do have teamplay enabled (it's enabled or disabled in the "Advanced" part of the "Create game" screen).

The only teams I could get to work properly was "hgrunt;scientist".  I never took the time to figure out why this was the only combination that would work.  See the old news for November 12, 2000...

One of these days I'll go back and try to fix the teamplay problem with OpFor.
