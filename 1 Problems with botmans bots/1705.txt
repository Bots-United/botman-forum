I had three quick questions i wuol like to ask ......

1.    When is the next version of HPB bot coming out?

2.     In version 1.4 of the HPB bot the engineers will not stop wacking the snipers with their spanner - Will you fix this in the 
next version?

3.    Can you please add a camp option in the waypoint menu - like snipe, only any bot can do it?

1. Don't ask when the next version is coming out. As he doesnt know. Read the readme file that comes with the bot

2.  in version 1.4a(its newer than 1.4) the engies dont repair armor as much.

3. only botman knows this, he can anwer that 1
