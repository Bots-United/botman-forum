It's the bit extra writing under a line like this -> -----, for exmaple BeaverMon's is BeaverMon killed Imabot with headshot 
BeaverMon: Oooooooooh! That's gota hurt!
Is this like some sort of signature mark, and how would I get one to appear on all my post without having to write it out every time.

Do you mean the signature?  Just use "Change profile" up above to edit your signature.  The signature will automatically be added at the end of each post.
