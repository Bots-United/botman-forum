The first time I tried the HPB bot on the 2fort map the bots were just turning around and jumping. After I downloaded the Realbot I read through its bot.cfg file and noticed the lines

#fix - fps not higher than 45
fps_max 45

I set my fps_max value in the HPB bot.cfg to 45 and now he bots finally run around! The bots seem to navigate smoother if your framerate is lower.
If it's too high (around 70) the bots no longer follow their waypoints. I had the same problem with bots basing on your source code.

Great job botman! Now your bots really rock :-D

Okay, that's good to know.  I'll stick that in the ReadMe.txt file until I can get a decent graphics card with a high enough framerate where I can duplicate the problem and fix it.

What OS are you using, monkeylooker?  I had the same problem you described with Realbot and HPB_bot on 98SE, ME, and 2K.  I was able to get Realbot Alpha 2.02 to finally work on 98SE by using the fix you are suggesting.  Realbot FTR seems to work w/ or w/o doing this now, at least in 98SE and ME, although some of the bots tend to move around more if you keep the fps_max fix in there so I do.  HPB_bot works in 98SE if I host from within the game itself, but not for a dedicated server (jumping and spinning problem).  I added fps_max 45 to the bot.cfg file as you did but to no avail.  I didn't try adding it to the server.cfg file, but I don't think it would matter as it's getting loaded from the bot.cfg file anyhow.

Hopefully, I'll get around to trying both Realbot FTR and HPB_bot (with fps_max fix if necessary) on Win2K with the dedicated server again tonight now that I have Win2K reinstalled.  At least Realbot FTR finally works on a dedicated server, but I'd like to get HPB_bot to work on it as well so a few of my friends and I can get a little TFC practice off of the pub servers.

I agree.  When I can get the bots to work, they are great!

The same problem occurs using Bobabot and Firebot, dunno if there are other bots using the HPB source(?).
And, Kramerika, the fps_max value is stored in the tfc config.cfg, that's why you can leave out the line in bot.cfg. You only need to change the value once, which also works using the console in run-time(good for experiments).Perhaps a dedicated server doesn't work because the fps_max value doesn't apply there, but I really dunno. 
I'm using Win98. I don't think it depends on the OS though.
The bots also don't get trapped that often if you set the value lower than 45, at cost of framerate, of course.
Hey botman, perhaps you know how to fix the dedicated server, too?

I think NNBot uses the same source?  Yeah, I know about fps_max being stored in the config.cfg file.  When testing Realbot I did leave it out of the bot.cfg file, but I also typed higher values into the console from within game which changes the value in the game and the config.cfg file like you said.  Try Realbot FTR with higher values of fps_max and see what happens for you.  At least they never spaz/jump/spin in place anymore like they did in Alpha 2.02 for me (which was fixed by setting fps_max lower for that version).  For reference, my fps hit a ceiling at about 100 w/ a TNT2 Ultra, PIII 800, 256 MB PC133 RAM.

fps_max does work on a dedicated server though I'm not sure what impact it really has.  I've set it and had the server report the correct number back to me.  Setting fps_max low on the dedicated server in Win98 did allow me to use Realbot Alpha 2.02 where it wouldn't work otherwise.  This doesn't seem to work with HPB_bot and the dedicated server in Win98 though I need to do some more testing.  We'll see what I can do with Win2K as well.

HPB_bot won't work on a dedicated server no matter what I try (including fps_max) in Win98, WinME, or Win2K.  The bots mainly stay in the respawn and jump and spin in place.  Very rarely some will eventually move out but then stop and start the same routine off and on along the way.

However, to back up what the monkeylooker claims, if I set fps_max low, HPB_bot does work properly hosting from the in-game browser on a non-dedicated server in Win98 (haven't been able to test this in WinME or Win2K).

Realbot version FTR now works fine with any type of server in Win98, WinME, and Win2K w/o even using fps_max (where it was required for Alpha 2.02 as I've said before).  Hard to say why it functions across the board now where HPB_bot doesn't.  Seems like a combination of OS and framerate, but with the varying results of my testing, it's still hard to say for sure.
