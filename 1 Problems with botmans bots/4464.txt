Hey can any help me out here.
I have a dedicated server running with PODBots.
I'm trying to get it to work with the addbot command and remove bot commands.
Is there a plugin/tool that i can use to admin the podbots from inside the server while playing??

Note: Markus 'Count Floyd' Klinge's POD-bot is not a bot made by botman. There is a special forum for POD-bot here:

Answer: If you are using the bare bones 2.5 version of POD-bot, you need the 'hacked' podbot.dll to have the dedicated server commands work. There is a known bug in POD-bot 2.5 that prevents the bot commands to work on a dedicated server. Links to this DLL are available in the POD-bot forum, if I remember right (that's been a long time I haven't been there, since I have been kicked out).
