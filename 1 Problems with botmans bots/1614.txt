When creating a waypoint file, I noticed that there was a flag that was set on some of the waypoints that indicated that there was a weapon nearby.  This flag however, is not listed in the flag menu.  The problem I had was that a waypoint I placed was detecting a weapon nearby, but it was on the opposite side of a wall.  Because the flag was not listed, I could not remove the flag.  I am using HPB 1.3 with Half-life 1.1.0.6 and in standard deathmatch.

I noticed another bug.  At a ladder, one bot was on the bottom and one on the top, and both were trying to use their crowbar to kill the other, but neither could get a hit.

For Deathmatch, you should take a look at the JUMBOT, it rules.

Okay, two more bugs! :)

Right now the HPB bot doesn't use the waypoint tags in Half-Life deathmatch.  I'll have to modify the waypoint tagging code to make sure that entities that it detects near waypoints are actually visible.  I'll fix this in the next release (then you won't have to remove the tag).

Bots also won't duck down to attack someone when they are on a ladder.  In fact they don't attack anyone at all (even with the guns) when they are on a ladder.  There was a reason for this a long time ago when I implemented the ladder support but I can't remember what it was now.  I'll see if I can get them to attack people when they are on ladders in the next release also.  Anybody know of a map that consists of only ladders and nothing else? ;)
