I have noticed when I lay a waypoint near a healthkit or armor etc. the console would say "found helathkit!" or "found some armour!". The problem about this is, I don't think the bots seem to know if they need health or armour and they just keep running towards health etc. which is making them go off-course etc and not follow all of the waypoints in front of them!!!

Another bug, which you have probably noticed is that in levels like hunted etc. where a team has an alliance with another i.e. Bodyguards have an alliance with the Hunted... The bots always just try to shoot bots in a different team, this means that the bodyguards will try and kill the Hunted!!! Kinda funny... but not the rules of the game!

You are correct.  The current random wandering around waypoint stuff doesn't know where items are because there's no code to generate a path from point A to point B.

I put the stuff in the waypoint code that marks waypoints near items (like healthkits) so that later on I would be able to add the path finding code and know where items of interest are.

Also the bots will wander away from waypoints if there is something they see that they think they can pick up (or use, like ladders or buttons).  Again this is something that has not be completed yet.  I will eventually add a weighting factor to things like weapons and ammo, etc. and the bots will decide whether they need to stay on the path to get to a goal, or wander off to pick up an item (even if they are engaged in combat, at little extra health never hurts).

As far as shooting their teammates, you are correct, the bots don't know the rules of any of the games yet.  Since it is impossible for me to define a set of rules for every possible game (since each map could have different rules of play), I will start with capture the flag.  Once they know how to do that, I will probably move on to another type of game (capture zones in order).  But I will never be able to cover all types of gameplay.
