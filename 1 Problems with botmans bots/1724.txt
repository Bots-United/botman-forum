You should add a command menu for your bot like in "abot".

What sort of commands do you need?  If you are asking about stuff like follow me, stay here, go for the flag, etc. it wouldn't do any good to have these in a menu since the bots won't follow those orders anyway.  How many times have you played on an Internet server and had someone actually do what you told them to?  Why should the bots be any different?
