Whilst playing on 2fort and i am stood out side on the opposite side of the bridge to a bot the bot sees me so tries to walk to me but of course they fall into the water.  can u possibly stop them from doing this.  the person who made oddbot has managed it maybe you could get the code off him.  
Also when kicking a bot and then adding another to replace the kicked one sometimes leaves the bot joined the game but not actually picking a team.

greatful if you could sort this!

Yes, I agree.  The bot running into the water thing is kind of annoying.  One of these days I'll get around to implementing some code to prevent the bots from falling off of ledges (unless they are trying to get to an enemy that is below them and they can survive the fall).

The kicked bot thing is another annoying problem.  I'm not sure why this is happening only on TFC.  Another kicking bug I just found today was that if you kick a bot from Holy Wars, the other bots still think the player is in the game and will attack non-existant players.  I'm not sure what's causing that one either.

the bots also try to kill the info_player_start entity in TFC.  they just sit there and shoot it.

I already know several ways to "solve" this problem.

1. Always follow waypoints (sideways straffing while aiming/firing at the enemy).

2. Avoid ledges by using Tracelines (especially avoid ledges over water or high drops unless there are waypoints leading that way).

The problem is finding the time to put this stuff in the HPB bot code.
