hi everyone, i am experiencing a problem of the server dropping players becoz of reliable channel overflow...

and i discover it was caused by monster plugins...

anyone has similar experience as mine?
or does anyone knows the solution?

my server is running cs mod on linux
meta plugins: amx, player name, and clanmod

Your problem is probably related to the AMX plugin.

Many players reported me there were problems with the AMX plugin when using my plugins too ; since mine are very small pieces of code that can't possibly interact with other things, I guess it's the same for botman's Monster plugin which is quite a big piece of code. It looks like the AMX plugin works well only when standalone, or almost.

You should try disabling the AMX plugin and see if your server runs better.

Did you see this in the Monster ReadMe.txt file?...

"WARNING: Precaching too many monsters can cause problems in some MODs!  Each monster has models and sounds that are required by the monster and these models and sounds take up memory on the server and memory  on the client.  If clients are crashing and seeing the error message "S_Findname: Out of sfx_t", then you are precaching too many monsters on the server.  Remove some of these monsters from the monster_precache.cfg file and remove them from map specific monster .cfg file for the map where the problems occurred (i.e. if clients are crashing when running the map blastwar.bsp, the you may need to remove some of the monsters from the blastwar_monster.cfg file)."
