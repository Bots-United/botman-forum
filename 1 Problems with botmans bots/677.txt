You're the only one that's reported this problem.  I don't have any problems with them in badlands on my machine at home or my machine at work.  They run straight out of the respawn room and head for the bridge going to the other team's building (usually meeting a bot or two along the way).  They run up the stairs toward the flag pit, grab the flag, stumble up the ladder, duck out through the passage way, make their way back to the bridge, and run home to the capture point.

I don't know what could be wrong unless you're still running one of the HPB bot Alpha releases.

Does anybody else have any problems with the bots just running back and forth between 2 waypoints on badlands or any other map with a waypoint file?  (without the waypoint file they won't do much at all, so make sure there is one in the tfc\maps folder).

 hmmmm..... there must be a file in the half-life folders screwing it up...most of the files stayed in there, wonder which one it could be, i would go out and buy the new HL pack with cs but have no money

Bots work fine on all maps so far...keola must not have waypoints for badlands

   hey naughtydog...i got it working now....i put it up in another post saying that i got it fixed...yes it had waypoints for badlands it comes with botman's bot,plus i tryed to add some in places because i thought there might have been gaps between waypoints but no, the problem was is there was a file that was screwin it up, like i said above but i wasn't sure then,i re-installed it and made sure all the files were gone this time and it worked! only thing that sucks is i dont have my mods anymore :( but i have copied the new half-life counter-strike CD, and now i have all the mods i had plus more :)
