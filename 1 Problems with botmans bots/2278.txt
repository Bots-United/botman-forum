Ok, i've read everything I could find on it, and tried quite a few things, but I cannot seem to get adminmod & botmixer5000 to work.

I don't know if i'm missing something major or what, but if someone can please tell me the best (or just how) way to setup BotMixer5000 & admin_mod on a dedicated linux server... I would be very greatful.

First install all your bots you wanne use with botmixer then install botmixer and and after that install adminmod !Create a file called Metagame.ine, put dlls/botmixer.dll in that file.Next step is to tell botmaster what bots are installed ,you can do this by editing this file "botmixer5000.cfg"Ok thats all it should work !

mmm, for some reason I think I forgot to try loading BotMixer using metagame.ini ... Crap, dunno how I forgot to try that, must have been the lack of caffiene at the time.... I'll give that a try when I get a chance. Thanks.
