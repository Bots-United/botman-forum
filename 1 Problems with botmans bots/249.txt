OK, no one read my first post I wrote this so I'll write it here:

IN beta 1.1:
BUG: SHORT PAUSE waypoints made the blue team members completely grind to a halt and they never moved at ALL until i removed the waypoint to a normal one. The red team seemed to get through ok for some reason though, i don't know if it affected them.

Actually I did see your comment before, I just didn't reply to it.

I'll look into it.

I can't reproduce your problem.  Here's what I did....

Moved the 2fort.wpt map out of the maps directory.

Started TFC in 2fort.

Created a waypoint in the blue team spawn room.  Created a waypoint in the spawn room close to the door.  Created another waypoint on the other side of the door (out of the spawn room).  Created a waypoint in the middle of the ammo room.  Created a waypoint infront of the next door.  Created a waypoint on the other side of the door.  Created a circular path just outside the second door.

I went back in the ammo room and set the waypoint in the middle to a "pause waypoint".  I saved the waypoint file and restarted 2fort.  I created 1 blue team bot.  It ran out of the spawn room, reached the pause waypoint, paused for 2 seconds and continued on outside to the loop.

I kicked that bot, then changed the pause waypoint to a "blue team specific pause waypoint" and saved the waypoint file.  I restarted 2fort and created a blue team bot.

The same thing happened.  The bot ran out of the spawn room, paused at the blue team specific pause waypoint for 2 seconds then ran on outside into the endless loop.

Have you tried creating a new waypoint file with pause waypoints in it to see if you can reproduce the problem?  I can't fix something that might be broke if I can't reproduce the problem.  If you can reproduce it in a VERY simple example, e-mail the waypoint file to me and I'll take a look.

i know what he is talking about, its when the bots reach an intersection and they decide which way to go, they pause for a sec or two to think then they go alnog the path, it is annoying but hey it works.

hmm, well the first time i noticed it when i was making waypoints for totalwar and becuase the first doors that the bots had to go through were abot slower than others to open fully so that the bots could go through them, I had to put in short pause waypoints. so I added a few bots on each team and the bots on the blue team just grouped up at the door standing there! while I went into spectate mode, and could'nt see a red bot in their respawn so they got through ok, somehow... maybe this was just a glitch at the time, many things like this can happen.
