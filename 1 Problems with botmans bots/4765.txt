If the map has LARGE open spaces then the distance culling is preventing areas far away from being seen (similar to the "maxdistance" compile parameter or the worldspawn 'MaxRange' key value).

You would have to change the BSP viewer source code and recompile the BSP viewer to change the max view distance for polygons.

I d'ont think it's the viev distance because it's always (polygons rendered: 0) and it doesent matter how far the polygons are away. only if the camera has the right position some of the textures appears.

yes no problems. i think things like ladders and weapons are always visible and somtimes when a texture appears there are white lines on it

but i'm not sure if it's a problem if i' save them only with worldcraft (hammer) or if i have to save them in another way.

Hammer will only save as .map or .rmf which the BSP viewer doesn't support (and can't open anyway).

I think you mean you are compiling the maps (using the compile tools) from inside Hammer.  This is okay and should work.

Does BSP viewer have a problem with ALL of the maps that you create or just this one.  Try creating a simple small square with textures and build that as a .bsp file to see if that works.

i've made a few maps big maps or only little rooms. i can always see the player and ladders and stuff like that but only if a part of a normal thing (walls...) appears there are some polygons rendered.

it looks as if i've enabled clipping through walls and i'am in a wall.

I have no idea what's going on.

Perhaps the OpenGL rendering code isn't supported on your graphics card.  Try viewing standard maps from Half-Life, TFC, or Counter-Strike and see if those do the same thing.  If so, see if there are more recent drivers available for your video card and try downloading and installing them.  If that doesn't fix it there's nothing else you can do to fix this problem.
