Is this problem reproducable?  There may still be a bug similar to the teamplay vs. deathmatch bug that the HPB bot had with FLF in the 4.0 release.

Hmm, I don't know, I never tried it again though!!! I used the flf_snow waypoints from the unknown waypoints!! from waypoint warehouse in http://www.geocities.com/thesirclan/waypoint/flf.htm

I was playing DEF (the first def team, commandos, i think) and i kicked someone from my team, then all of the bots at the spawn points just jump up and started shooting walls and shooting each other, although they were mostly shooting walls, I had observer mode ON btw.

Your not alone Cheese.  It does it to me on every FLF map every time I kick a bot.  Most of the time I notice all the bots shoot the area where the bot was before it was kicked.

I'll keep looking into this.  This problem may (or may not) go away in the next release.  I have changed the code that is used to detect whether or not players are alive and in the game in FLF.  I had changed this so that the welcome message will be displayed properly in FLF (like in TFC).

I'll try kicking some bots from both teams on several FLF games this weekend to see if I can reproduce/fix the problem.

The best way to reproduce it would be to kick a bot when a large number of bots are grouped together at a defend point.

I've seen that bug in action too...the bots just go and shoot at the ground where the bot was when he got kicked. At first I thought they were seeing someone "through the wall" like they do on TFC sometimes, but I check in observer mode and there's nobody there! It is kind of fun to knife them to death though... >:}
