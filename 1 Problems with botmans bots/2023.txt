I always get 18 bots on my server automaticly regardless of how many addbots I add or subtract from the bot.cfg or however I set min_bots or max_bots. I tried removeing it w/ the exe and reinstalling it, but it still pops 18 even w/ your defaults. (I tried w/ out the # in front of min/max_bots as well, same effect) and I have tested w/ and w/out it being dedicated and have tried diffrent maps (2fort, 2morefort, avanti, casbah, warpath) and diffrent player numbers allowed on the server (20/24) but it still spawns in 18. any ideas of how to fix this? I really want a good server up by friday for my lan party, heh. Just need some good for the slow periods. I want it to be around 6 and I want it set with your min/max_bots command. I was thinking it was a remnent of an earlier bot I tried perhaps? thanks in advance (I tried to document, well... heh)

You should be able to kick the bots cant you?

check the mapname_bot.cfg file (eg 2fort_bot.cfg) I have the same prob with too many bots joining and stuff and I looked at that config file. I saw too many addbots in it!

Yes, check in the maps directory for a map specific bot.cfg file.  If you've installed other bots (like FoxBot, it installs map specific bot.cfg files, like maps\2fort_bot.cfg) you may have some map specific bot.cfg files that you did not create.  These will be used to spawn a specific number of bots on a specific map.

the min/max_bots commands only work while using a dedicated server to run the bot! :)

you were right Botman. Some other bot had left cfgs in my maps folder. I didn't expect to find any there, so I didn't check yesterday. Kinda sad really... been writing scripts since I bought the game, but couldn't find those. In anycase, problem is now solved, thanks for the responses all, I'll try to help others now.
