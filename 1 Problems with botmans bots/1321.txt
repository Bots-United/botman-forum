During my waypointing spree today i've noticed the bots will still sometimes stop during a capture for no apparent reason(this is stated as fixed). That is about the only real bug i've found...another minor thing is that recons repeated try to snipe you at point blank range.  LOL. This is a minor problem and is actually pretty funny.  If you need FLF 1.2 waypoints get them at http://mcg106.virtualave.net/waypoint.html
