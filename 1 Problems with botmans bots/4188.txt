I seen to be having a problem with sniper waypoints in TFC. In a nutshell, I can't remove them.

I tried removing the navigation waypoint next to it but it was still there so I tried creating another one to see if that would remove it but it just added another. Anyone know how to remove them, Thx.

You don't need to remove the aiming waypoint (if that's what you are talking about).

When you delete the sniper waypoint, it will automatically remove the nearest aiming waypoint.

Make sure you are on the opposite side of the sniper waypoint from the aiming waypoint when trying to remove a waypoint, this way it will find the sniper waypoint first instead of the aiming waypoint (since it searches for the NEAREST waypoint when you try to delete one, and you want to force the sniper waypoint to be the nearest one).

If you have trouble removing a waypoint, make sure you are VERY close to it.  You can crouch to make your movements smaller, then stand up and delete the point that is right at your feet.
