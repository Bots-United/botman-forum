All of the CS bots will have to be updated (since there are now new entities).  I'll take a look at it when I get a chance to download the 1.0 release and possibly release an update to the HPB bot this weekend.

Thank you very much..
I use botman's bot to build two bot sites.
Users like them very much..
I use bots to join terrorists and men play CT.
When the person number is over bot's.
man join to bot and fight to CT.
It's very interesting..
If you need CS 1.0 or CS7110..
Maybe you can download from my site..
