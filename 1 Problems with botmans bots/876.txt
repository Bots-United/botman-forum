I got that annoying error while using the Abot when I attempt to quit Halflife. It is an "illegal operation" thingy and this is what good ol' Dr. Watson said to me :)

I've put my crossover2 and casbah maps on my webspace. I don't call it a website, me, I just use it as a handy file repository :)

Cheesemonster, feel free to copy them to your website if you think they're good enough.

Casbah problems:-
It's a bit balanced in favour of blue. I forced red to use the bridge through no-man's land to lessen the spamming in the main road. It's a longer route. I can only improve this waypoint file if bots can jump to reach waypoints over step height.

Also there's just the one sniper waypoint per map. Other places are just too open to be of use.

Crossover2 problems:-
Again there's a lot of spam on the bridge. I haven't put waypoints in the water since having bots blown into water is just too rare an event to bother with. Again if bots could jump, they could jump into the water and I'd work on the waypoints.

I haven't managed to get bots go up the ladders very reliably, either within the base or on the yard outhouse. This really stops two potential sentry points and one potential sniper point per team. You're welcome to tinker with that!

For the future, when the next version of Abot is released, the bots will be able to take truly random routes around the maps. This will cut down on the mid-map spamfests, and there will be more capping.
