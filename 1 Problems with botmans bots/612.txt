botman, i was playing around trying to make a script & i left this line just like this:

# change default bot skill level to 2
botskill

i didn't put in a # for skill & the bots were totally clueless and didn't shoot, even when i did assign them "addbot 2 2 dillburt 1"
they still didn't improve any.

So i'm guessing that i need that defualt level?

The "default" is probably 0 which will screw them up as you have discovered.  Set the botskill to a value from 1 (the best) to 5 (the worst) and they should work properly after that.
