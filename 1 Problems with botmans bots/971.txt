Im seeing more and more bots out on the game servers now and its upsetting for the reason I know they arent finished yet they dont build sgs and dont use special skills taking the fun out of the game.its like having a hotrod with a big 454 V8 engine and it only runs on two cylinders:(
maybe bot man should wait on these releases till they are almost complete, and just use beta testers till then..I even noticed on my server that kids say these bots suck and beg for the admin to dump them or they leave:(
like i said i feel the same when joining a server with the bots i leave cause i know they are only half done and are only using half skills...
