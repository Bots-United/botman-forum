Hi I don't get it. Why are the bots so retarted? I could understand if that's just the best they can get,but foxbot is 1000 times better. Unfortunately foxbot doesn't work with linux so I have to deal with these scripts.

Also, why is the skill based on how quickly the bots fire? How does that have anything to do with skill? Is there anyway I can make the bots smarter, and if not can anyone recommened better linux bots for tfc? thanks.

They're dumb because I don't choose to spend the time writing code to make them smarter.

If you watch players that haven't played the game very much, you will notice a few things that seem to be generic among new players...

1) They don't strafe very much at all.  They tend to run in straight lines.

2) They don't always realize that you can hold a mouse button down to get a weapon to fire rapidly (they keep clicking the button to fire and they don't click as quickly as possible).

3) They don't always keep running.  They tend to stop quite a bit and look around to try to find people to shoot.  When they are stationary they are easy targets.

4) They don't aim very well because they haven't had much practice playing the game.  They don't play the game very often, so they don't improve their skills (you can't stay good at something if you don't practice frequently, no matter what it is you are trying to do).

Imagine, if your grandma was playing the game.  That's the skill level that a new player would have.

Perhaps instead of complaining about how poorly the bots play the game, you should create a bot on your own for TFC and show everybody how it should be done.  If you want to download my HPB bot source code as a starting point, you can do that, but you're probably so l33t that you don't even need any examples to start from, right?

Stay tuned for the first release of Bob's bot, the long-awaited Bobot 1.0 that will r0x0r y0uR b0x0rS.

What you linux hacker doesnt seem to get though, is the fact that if botman would have once wanted to write the best bot for TFC, imo he'll have put much more effort than he did in it (and God he already put quite some), and he'd be continuing his bot right now.
First, botman was not paid to write the HPB_bot.
Second, the HPB_bot's goal was primarily to show people that it was possible to get bots running with Half-Life mods.
Third, although there are out there several people who are obsessed enough to spend countless hours a day in front of their bot code (maybe I am one of those), there are also very talented programmers who write things much faster than the others. I don't think I am mistaken if I say that RedFox, the author of FoxBot, and Count Floyd, the author of PodBot, are two of these, and there are others. Not everyone has the same abilities.
Fourth and last, you have the source code. As a Linux user, that should make you if not happy, at least indulgent. Obviously not. Two reasons, 1. the bot is REALLY bad, or 2. you are a lamer.

I personally tend to considerate the second reason.



Disclaimer: not all facts mentioned here, especially in the l33t@ge speak, do reflect my appreciation. Bot coders know what I really think of them.

I would understand the excuse that you were just throwing some code together to show that bots could work in HL. However, if you were really just doing this as a demonstration, why waste the time to make a website and a forum? It seems to me that if you spent so much time on a project that you'd at least try to make the bots worth my time.

Well, for starters, I don't really play TFC all that much.  I don't play Counter-Strike at all and the HPB bot REALLY sucks at Counter-Strike.

I am really sorry that the HPB bots aren't worth your time.  I will gladly refund the money that you paid for the HPB bot and will give you an additional 50% for your trouble.  ;D

Thank you, you just confirmed what I was expecting. You are a lamer.
And possibly a moron too, but as I'm very touchy about logic, this also needs to be demonstrated.

lol I can't imagine this bot without a site and forum, the whole point was the fact that these bots are open source and beg to be coded by someone else. IF you think the bots are dumb, then download the source and make a better one if your up to it.

are you using waypoints for them 
as far as tfc goes .. i think they are pretty good .. good enough for me anyway .. to be able to play without real people .. not to have to go on-line .. you can have fun with them .. acropolis2 is far out fun .. such a war zone he he
and dustbowl, push, shutdown2, mulch_trench, and oh yeah .. i love maya ha ha .. bots fight tooth and nail .. totalwar and warpath and avanti ..all these are great .. guess it is something to do with what you expect .. i will never forget the first time i set hpb_bot up and saw them in action playing tfc .. it was like .. amazing :)
botman .. you should have a little more faith in ya bot man :)... and pierre .. why are you working on podbot(i have podbot .. i know they are great/best cs bot) when i thought it would be great to have a updated verison of you'r RACC bot which for a non-waypoint bot is brilliant .. i know they don't compare to podbot but still i feel you don't think they are as good as they really are .. anyway i don't the in's and out's etc so don't take offence please .. i just love you'r bot too and am disappointed that cs1.5 did not see and updated verison of you'r bot :)

I don't work on podbot, even if I once released some half-baken podbot fixes that were born out of my frustration of seeing that what was supposed to be the best bot out there for Counter-Strike had that much irritating bugs. It was a five minutes work, half tested half not, and it stood the chance to please people. Although I'm glad of it, I would feel ungrateful to people who assume that I've turned working on podbot exclusively. The work on RACC is going on, but you have to understand that it's a long term work, involving cognitive AI. Not whatever simple "look for enemy - seek enemy - destroy enemy" bot. And because developers are not as cold-minded as the machines they program, I still enjoy from time to time to have a good and destressful match with a bot, a bot that works, since RACC doesn't yet. Pod-bot for example.

that was a joke, whatever bad it was. The moron who was arguing against botman used to call himself "bob". Hence why.

What cheesemonster said, you don't like it, get the source and make it better. Everyone here except you seems to have read botmans faq's and readme files. The HPB_Bot isn't meant to be the best bot. Its there for peoples enjoyment, and for developers to make it better. Which is exactly with your attitude, you need to TRY and do. It isn't as simple as

Who in the hell is this bob loser? And does he really run Linux? 

If so I'm ashamed to be a fellow linux user. 

To Bob:

As a linux user you of all people should understand the idea of open source projects. Did you know that this FoxBot you rave about is based on botmans HPB_bot template code? Did you know that nearly all (or is it all?) hl bot code is based on botmans code? Did you know that botman is the GENIUS that figured out how to take a mod, that has to load a seperate dll file and load yet another dll file into the game along side the mods dll file? Perhaps I have my history incorrect and someone correct me if I'm wrong but if I'm not mistaken Jumbot was first to build a bot. A great bot, I enjoyed the hell out of it in hldm mode. But that bot couldn't be taken to other mods because it was loaded as a mod, like TFC or CS is. The ingenius part about HPB_bot is the fact that it loads as a mod and then loads the mod (say tfc) on top of that. 

I know a few C developers and linux fanatics myself. Not just people that went to school for CS but people who (godforbid) write code on their own outside of school or work "For Fun" and they found at least parts of botmans code to be astounding. It's obvious your talking to a man who has a lot of experience in C and C++ and from what I hear a lot of it is old skool. 

Speaking of... Botman, what is your experience in CS? We were speculating around 10-15 years... 

Anyway, Bob... Being a person of the GNU generation you should appreciate that botman gave you his code free (as in beer) with no warranty (if it breaks you get to keep both halves) and he gave it to you free (as in speech) so that you could modify/improve his code to your liking. 

I've been using botmans bots on my net server for what is it now Jeffery? 2 years? They aren't the best opponents in the world but I've played many a "Player" that was was worse, even accused the bots of cheating in some cases. And the bots keep my servers full or nearly full for 20 out of 24 hours in a day. Who wants to join an empty server eh? 

In closing, I am ashamed of you Bob. If you truly are a linux user you have a lot to learn about the community behind the OS you have chosen.

I think there were two bots before jumbot.. Think that the first had a name similar to Pheneas or something like that.. But after all.. It was about 4 years ago so I can be mistaken as well..

Jumbot was first...

http://www.telefragged.com/thefatal/jumblow.shtml

...but it didn't work properly because of an engine bug in Half-Life version 1.0.0.9 so Rich didn't release the bot until later.

At about the same time, there was Phineas Bot...

http://web.archive.org/web/20020121013233/http://phineas.valveworld.com/

Both of these were released after the 1.0.1.3 version of the engine which fixed the bug where bots wouldn't turn their bodies to face the direction they were aiming.

I still have to say the HPB Bot is the best. Although it don't have insane moves as the FoXBot, it's great, because it's the first bot I know for TFC.

I'll agree that the bot is dumb... But judging from what I see in the code... And the process botman has done to make it work...
Well it is understandable.
I was like you once, keep bitchin "Buggy bot, fux0red bot, no flippin AI" So when the bot alternatives narrowed down to 0 working ones I got mad as hell and thought of joking by saying:
"I'll make my own bot then" That sentence got around in my head several times until...
Until...
Until...
I said "Well, hell I'll do it, I will give it a shot" And guess what? I'm in the middle learning process now and I find it fun... That was Botmans propellant force and now it is mine and the force to every coder out there.
We ain't doing this for money but for fun.
So try it yourself before bitching, how many bots would there be out there if it hadn't been for botman?
0! Everybody called the project impossible, but botman did the impossible and proved that it was possible after all.

So Botman, I don't know if you are still improving it, weather you don't or do you should now that the revolution was thanks to YOU!!!!!!

Yes, I know HPB is dumb. Honestly, HPB is a bot with five levels of Aimbot ("skill") which determine how often the bots hit (misses, acutally!), moves around like a train on rails (waypoints) and makes a straight line from him to the enemy, regardless of hazards obstacles.

BUT, HPB is STILL my HLDM bot. And it's still my DMC bot, and my Holywars bot (I think it's the only one lol). There are better alternatives. But why? HPB is a SIMPLE bot, period. No botmenus, advanced jumps, weapon tracking, danger avoiding. I don't need that for some DM games, like HLDM, Holywars, and DMC. I need is a fast stable bot, that can aim and shoot at anything it sees. For me HPB is enough. It's the only bot I have that can give me 24 bots no slowdowns no crashes.

I also used to run HPB for TFC. But now, I use FoXBot. But I think Foxbot is a cheating, but it does the job for TFC. I use RealBot AI for CS, which is another, simple to operate bot (although it is supposed to think a lot). I also used POD, but it crashed too much, is buggy, and it's aiming is very unrealistic. And where did all these bots come from? HPB!!!
