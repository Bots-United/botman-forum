Here's my server setup - home.earthlink.net/~halflife12/crash/infodump.txtinfodump.txt

I'm running HPB_bot v3.0
HL Server 4.1.1.1 on WinXP
AdminMod 2.50.52
Metamod v1.16  2003/05/08
STATSME 2.7.1, 08/03/2003
FoxBot v0.698 Build 18
Stripper2 v1.00.00, 02/02/2002
Monster v3.00.00, 06/30/2002
LogDaemon v1.00.5, 2002/09/17
Bleeding v1.3 22/05/2003

I'm playing from my Win98 system (I've never had these problems in the past). But i've never had this much stuff running at the same time.. :)

Yesterday when it crashed my Win98, Norton crashguard created this - home.earthlink.net/~halflife12/crash/Half-Life.txtHalf-Life.txt

Today when win98 locked up, i went & was looking in the dos box on the server & it said this - home.earthlink.net/~halflife12/crash/dropped.txtdropped.txt

I have my Monster & Stripper2 files home.earthlink.net/~halflife12/crash/HERE along with my HPB_bot.cfg file if those might help. I do have something wrong in my Stripper2 file though.. Somewhere?
L 07/27/2003 - 16:33:27: [STRIPPER2] WARNING: unknown key in GameKeyValue: style!

Maybe somebody might know whats wrong?
I'll drop statsme & run with the rest of the plugins & see? Looks like something with my network dosen't it??

"Overflow on netchan" means there is too much data being sent back and forth between the Half-Life client and the server.

This can sometimes be caused by maps that have too many entities that send stuff to the client.  If you are running any new map that have been added recently, try removing them and see if the crashing problem stops.  Also see this...

I think i know what it was?
I got some Stripper2 files from somebody & with 20 bots playing, they sometimes crammed a teleporter & they would all start getting stuck. That increased my latency as high as 330.. I removed that one, & put one of mine in. Still somewhat of a problem in teleporters though. But atleast the bots teleport to were they can be killed or kill eachother because i have partial Friendly Fire on (Half Damage). I bet that's what must drop me.

Because the ONLY map i'm playing is 2fort.
No modifications except for Stripper2.
Hmmm, maybe a "trigger_push" at destination of teleportation?

Thanks botman!!

Hey, the "bots getting stuck" thing, I got that too. Map: cj2.bsp

I love this map but the bots don't since they seem to all want to jump into the same portal at once.
