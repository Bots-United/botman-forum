ok guys, I want to play TFC with the HLDM map 'Crossfire'. 'Crossfire' has 4 teams. When I enter 'Crossfire', all of the bots go on the blue team. I created a crossfire_HPB_bot.cfg file but it still doesn't work. I think the problem is that the crossfire_HPB_bot.cfg file is just a text file and isn't really a config file. Can anyone help me?

Copy another .cfg file edit it, and rename it.

You'll also have to change the "addbot" command in the map specific bot.cfg file to spawn the bots on specific teams, like this...

addbot 1
addbot 2
addbot 3
addbot 4
addbot 1
addbot 2
addbot 3
addbot 4

...this will create 8 bots (2 on each team) with random classes.  If you want to create specific classes then add the number of the class (1-9) after each of the above commands.

I think this prob has to do with the fact that crossfire is a HLDM map so has no info_tfdetect entity, which is what the HPB reads to determine teams, therefore the bots have no idea what teams there are.

Thats my guess.

That would be correct.  If it's not a map modified to officially support TFC then all the bots will be on one team (the blue team).

bot_reaction_time 2
bot_chat_percent 10
bot_taunt_percent 20
bot_whine_percent 10

bot_logo_percent 40
bot_grenade_time 25

botskill 1


addbot 1 2
addbot 1 3
addbot 1 9
addbot 2 2
addbot 2 4
addbot 3 3
addbot 3 7
addbot 3 9
addbot 4 4
addbot 4 6
addbot 4 7

the bots don't care if there is an info_tfdetect or not.  I use the above cfg and the teams all go nicely to whatever teams i assigned them.  The way that i have found it to work is to either start another map and the type "changelevel crossfire" in the console or you can simply put it in your tfc mapcycle. The way i have found it not to work, is when i try and just open up the tfc console and type "map crossfire" There is a map that someone made called crossfiretfc that is basically just the orginal crossfire with respawns, it also uses a key to trigger the airstrike.  It is kind of hard to find but i can post a link to it if anyone wants it.

I went ahead and uploaded crossfiretfc. Cut and paste the link as geocities is not fond of "hotlinking" files.

I guess the name would depend on what version you are runnning, i am still using version 1.6a at the moment. I don't know what they are named in 1.7

i had just got 1.7 The name is changed for some things. Although im still confused o the waypoints names. 2fort.HPB_wpt. It would make more sense to me if it was 2fort_HPB.wpt

Thanx every1! I got it to work. BTW: the config file has to be named crossfire_HPB_bot.cfg not crossfire_bot.cfg

"so all the waypoints on waypointwarehouse will have to be renamed?"

No, they don't.  The HPB bot 1.7 will automatically rename any HPB bot .wpt file to .HPB_wpt when you play that map.  The waypoint code will search for .HPB_wpt first then, if it can't find a .HPB_wpt file, it will look for .wpt files.  If it finds a .wpt file, it will load it, then automatically rename it to .HPB_wpt format.

People should be able to download waypoint files exactly the way they are (.wpt) and they will work with all future versions of the HPB bot.

Its going to be bad enough renaming the mapname_bot.cfg's Or do those get renamed automatically as well?

No, the .cfg files don't get automatically renamed (only the .wpt files).
