Subject: HPB Compatible With Other Mod....?

I recently downloaded the HPB Bot, it works pretty good for HL Deathmatch.  However, when I come to playing HPB Bots with other MODs such as CS or DMC, the bots become very stupid.

In CS, they do not buy weapons and they simply run around aimlessly and only shoot if they see an enemy.  This is understandable as CS maps are much more complicated and detailed waypoints are probably needed for a good CS bot.

However, for DMC, the bots are still very stupid.  They shoot at team members (when team play is enabled) and they don't switch weapons.  They will always stick to their standard shotguns and occasionally use the crowbar.

Why is this?  Botman, why support various MODs when the bots behave stupidly in them?

The HPB bot doesn't actually support Counter-Strike.  You'll need to download a bot that was actually written to support Counter-Strike.

I don't remember if I ever tested Deathmatch Classic in teamplay mode, so that might not work properly.  If you are playing any DMC maps that you do not have a waypoint file for (look in the dmc\maps folder for *.HPB_wpt files to see if there's a waypoint file for that map), then the bots won't play that map very well at all and will hardly ever find any of the weapons.  You'll need to create a waypoint file for those maps.  See the HPB_bot_waypoint.txt file for instructions on how to create waypoint files for maps that I didn't already waypoint myself.

If HPB is not compatible with CS, why include the "cstrike" folder at all?  It will only serve to confuse people (like me) that are trying to work HPB for CS.

Also, I was running the default DMC maps, so there should be no waypoint problems.  Yet, the bots still behave stupid.

Botman made this CS, so that was shown that Counter-strike was possible with mods.

When I was first developing the HPB bot, I was trying to get a bot working in TFC.  Other people were trying to get a bot working in Counter-Strike.  I didn't (and still don't) play Counter-Strike because I don't like it very much.

I added the Counter-Strike code to the HPB bot to show people what was necessary to get a bot to join a team in Counter-Strike.  Once they knew how to do that, they would be able to add all the other Counter-Strike specific stuff on their own.  I wasn't going to spend time adding code to support a MOD I didn't play (I would rather spend my time adding code for MODs that I do play).  I left the minimal Counter-Strike code in the HPB bot so that other new bot developers would have something to start from (rather than removing the minimal Counter-Strike code and having lots of people constantly ask me "What do I need to add to the HPB bot to get it to work with Counter-Strike?".

It's basically a carry-over of old code from the early days of the HPB bot and it was never removed.

Great, I understand better now.

But any reason with the stupid/weird bot behavior in DMC?

No waypoint file for that map?

I don't think so... it's a default map... comes with DMC.

No, the DMC waypoints are included in the HPB bot download.  If you install the bot for DMC, you get the waypoints automatically.

The waypoints that are included are for: DMC_DM1, DMC_DM2, DMC_DM3, DMC_DM4, DMC_DM6 and DMC_E1M2.  All other maps will require you to make your own waypoints or download them from some other web site.

Which map(s) specifically are you seeing problems with?

I've played DMC and I love the Quake sounds.
Sometimes they either use 1 of the 3 weapons;

Crowbar
Regular Shotgun
Lighting Gun

They don't use the Missile/Rocket Launcher, The Pipebomb Launcher, the Super Shotgun, and anything else for that matter. Just those 3 I listed.

Howard, check your HPB_bot.cfg file in dmc and see if your bots have a skill level of 5. If they do, they'll just walk around or sometimes just camp around the map. If they have 1, they'll come hunting for you I believe.
