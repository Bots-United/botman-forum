botman, say when i'm in the game and i would like to change the strafe, whine or grenade value's, will they take affect as soon as i change them? Or do they need to be executed from the bot.cfg?

I've tried both ways with chat and strafe, but i don't see any difference?

When i watch the bots the only real difference i see is they'll go forwards or backwards instead of left or right. I can't seem to get them to do that? I've tried the different values, Both 0 & 100. < -- But that was done when i bought the console down and typed the value in. Might be because i'm using Multi Bots Launcher? As far as  grenade throwing goes.. hehe I like it!! ;D I see you did some CS modification.. See, you must be playin CS lately huh? hehehe I know.. You don't like.. Just razzin ya. 
But other then that, i've no problems.

I read a few post's down below about Cheesemonster needing setting's and BeaverMon having problems. Here Guy's if you still need? BeaverMon, i've had the exact problem your talking about with not seeing text. Extract Titles out of my zip and put it in your TFC directory and you should be ok. I think ARES left a line or so in it which cause's that? Either that or i think it is that Abot use's those lines. Those are my original files..

You set these values BEFORE you create a bot.  Any bots that are added will use (and keep) the current settings of these.  Changing these values after bots are added to the game does nothing.  For example if you wanted to add 1 bot that didn't strafe, 2 bots that strafed 20% of the time and 3 bots that strafed 50% of the time you would give these commands (either manually or in the bot.cfg file)...

bot_strafe_percent 0
addbot
bot_strafe_percent 20
addbot
addbot
bot_strafe_percent 50
addbot
addbot
addbot

I'm pretty sure the MBL knows nothing about these new features and is probably creating a bot.cfg file that isn't taking advantage of these.  I recommend that you copy the bot.cfg file from the Half-Life\HPB_bot\tfc folder to the Half-Life\tfc folder and start the game manually (start Half-Life, select Custom game, TFC, Activate, Multiplayer game, LAN game, Create game, etc.)

I reinstalled Half-Life and I see the titles again. I needed to do a reinstall anyway. I had another copy of Half-Life on my hard drive that was causing more problems. Deleted that. Now everything's working a-ok!

Thanks anyway!

Ok, i started Half-Life the way you had said botman, so that i could have it load properly the bot.cfg and tried what you had listed above as an example. Didn't see to much except for what i was seeing before. (Ahh, i see it now though!)

 Yes, it still creates a bot.cfg and here is what's in it:
# addbot <team> <model> <name> <skill>
pause 2

botdontshoot 0
botskill 2
 
addbot 0 10 Steve 2
======================
But, see how it say's a bot named Steve is supposed to join. Well actully he never does! Anyway's to get to the point, "I forgot about how MBL let's you edit the Map Specific files" So i edited my badlands_bot.cfg and placed this in:

mp_footsteps 1
botskill 3

bot_whine_percent 100

bot_strafe_percent 50
bot_grenade_time 20
addbot 1 1 RunningScout 
addbot 2 1 Nike 
addbot 1 2 1Shot 
addbot 2 2 Thump 
addbot 1 3 G.I Joe 
addbot 2 3 Grrrr 
addbot 1 4 DetPack 
addbot 2 4 KaBoom 
addbot 1 5 Germ 
addbot 2 5 Ebola 
addbot 1 6 TailGunner 
addbot 2 6 RatTatTat 
addbot 1 10 RandomBlue 
addbot 2 10 RandomRed 
==================
Work's like a charm! And best thing is, Almost all of my maps are made Map Specified. 
So when i bought down the console in the game just to make sure it had the value's i placed in, Yep, they were all there! So i played an hour of badlands and NOW i see what the bot's do. I did'nt grasp it before. But from what i seen, the blue scout on my Team Zig Zagged left to right (He seemed to be most evident of doing that), the rest i mainly noticed, walked a bit straighter. But what i REALLY like is when they throw a gernade or spyball, both teams backup (And that's were i notice they'll move left to right) to avoid injury. 

A couple maybe "Bugs?" But i noticed a HWguy on the opposing team had stopped to throw one of those Red grenades at me, but i had been killed before he actully threw it, and i guess maybe he had gotten confused and held onto it.. "BoooM"! hehe.. He backed up with it and everything.. 
I had read and seen a pic from Cheesemonster below stateing about the bots going back and forth, yes i see it to. They gather by the door in badlands (Blue Team not sure about Red?) and they like pace back and forth till i or another bot opens the door, then they'll leave. I haven't tried it yet, but probably just needs a waypoint there? Another thing that i noticed (this also happens with Oddbot) is the bots get stuck in the doorway. I thought when the 1101 patch was released that was supposed to have been fixed? Anyway's, it seemed to have been a plus though as my blue scout was such a nimrod, grubber.hypermart.net/pic/badlands0003.GIFPic of said Nimrod, so it helped the bot paceing they were doing there. Ahhh, nothing like a curtious scout. :o
Last thing to mention would be that sometimes i'll see a scout respawn and throw his spikes.

========
Off topic a lil, but reason why i use MBL is because my video card won't allow -console while i'm useing Opengl mode. If i leave it in the target and start any of my mods, the screen turns a mess (Like what you see when your tv antenna is not tuned right) But i can here the game start in the background. I can still play starting without -console , but for some stupid reason, at times it makes my "console 1.0" line in my config change to "console 0.0".. It get's so agravateing when starting a game to only find out that i have no console.. Then i have leave and put 1.0 back in and restart my game.. 

--modified--
Oh yeah, that was just my example above of where i had placed the value's. But i understand that i could place in different sections the different value's of each, which i'm about to try as soon as i logout.. Well, speaking for myself since i'm not having any major problems on my Win98, i think you've made a nice improvement. Oh, i also see that the med will heal, when you call even when your health is at 86! As long as the med's not in combat. :)

"But, see how it say's a bot named Steve is supposed to join. Well actully he never does!"

The team number in that example is zero (team zero is not a valid team number) so that's why the bot doesn't join a team.

"But i noticed a HWguy on the opposing team had stopped to throw one of those Red grenades at me..."

The bots are SUPPOSED to throw a grenade that they have primed if the enemy dies before the bot tosses the grenade (at least that's what the code says anyway).  I'll have to go back and double check that.

"They gather by the door in badlands (Blue Team not sure about Red?) and they like pace back and forth..."

This may be due to a higher strafeing precentage (for narrow doors more strafing makes it more difficult for the bots to pass through doorways).  If there isn't a waypoint in the center of the door (marked as a door waypoint), this can help since the bots will slow down (which also slows the strafe speed) when they approach door waypoints.

"...the bots get  stuck in the doorway."

I'm not sure about this one.  In FLF the bots tend to approach a door from both sides and once and neither one will back off to let the door open.  I'll try to fix this bug in the next release of the HPB bot.

"Last thing to mention would be that sometimes i'll see a scout respawn and throw his spikes."

Weird.  I've noticed a bug in TFC where you get the caltrop damage thing when someone shoots you in the bottom of your feet (like if you are hanging over the ledge at the bridge on 2fort and get shot from directly underneath).  I may have a problem where the bots are getting ready to throw a grenade, get killed, then release the "grenade" immediately after they have respawned.  I'll have to check to make sure I reset the "is grenade primed" flag when the bots respawn.

"but for some stupid reason, at times it makes my "console 1.0" line in my config change to "console 0.0""

I put the "console 1.0" in my listenserver.cfg file (which usually doesn't get touched when you upgrade Half-Life).  Half-Life will execute config.cfg first, then will execute listenserver.cfg last, so any settings in listenserver.cfg will override those settings in the config.cfg file.

"Oh, i also see that the med will heal, when you call even when your health is at 86!"

Yes, the only time the medics will ignore calls for help is when they are engaged in combat or if you are already at 100% health.  Even if you are at 99% health they will still come to heal you if you call for them (I guess they figure that you're some kind of whiner who always has to be at 100% health).  They also still look for anyone nearby and directly in their line of sight that is low on health and will heal those players even if they don't cry for a medic.

"(I guess they figure that you're some kind of whiner who always has to be at 100% health)."

I'm 1 of them! LOL!

It also takes a couple a screams, before they hear you. 1 time, I screamed right behind him, and he was a foot away, he kept on walking. I screamed again, and he turned around and healed me.
