I am trying to use BSP_slicer on the map op4ctf_wonderland, and get the error:

*******ERROR*********
Error opening C:\\BSP_slicer.cfg: no such file or directory

Press ENTER to exit.


I have everything, including Half-Life installed in the default directories, and the BSP_slicer.cfg file is in the same directory as the tool (the way it unzipped by default)

The .cfg file says this (if any help):

//
// BSP_slicer configuration file
//
// BSP tools by botman (http://planethalflife.com/botman)
//

// lines beginning with double slash characters are comment lines

// Half-Life directory
$halflife_dir C:\SIERRA\Half-Life



I am using Windows XP, and I am trying to open the tool using Command Prompt.

Thanks for your help.

Did you install the BSP tools in the C:\ root directory?  That's where you're running the command from (since it's looking for C:\BSP_slicer.cfg).  If you unzipped the files into another directory (let's say C:\BSP_tool) then you will need to change to that directory before running the command...

C:\WINDOWS\system32> cd \bsp_tool
C:\BSP_tool> bsp_slicer -c whatever.bsp

botman

Thanks mate, that did the trick. I know where I went wrong now, so I'll explain for others in future:

Command Prompt in  Windows XP starts in the following directory by default:

x:\Documents and Settings\Logon ID>

(where x is drive letter windows is installed; and logon ID is current account username)

You need to use the CHDIR command to change directories.

I needed to change directories to to :

x:\Documents and Settings\Logon ID>CHDIR x:\BSP_tool

and then use the command :BSP_slicer;

But I was changing directories to:

x:\Documents and Settings\Logon ID>CHDIR C:\

and then typing;

BSP_tool\BSP_slicer    as the command,

So, because it was in the x:\ directory, it was trying to find BSP_slicer.cfg in there, not in x:\BSP_tool directory.

Ummm, hope that made sense...

Seems so simple now that I know.

Great tool by the way! :)
