I need to get a guide that explains how to install onto a linux rental server through ftp access. Its tfc mod if that matters.

Do you just need a list of what files go where?

Which TFC mod are you talking about?

The academic method is to install hlds into /usr/local, and to symlink the hlds binary into /usr/local/bin. But many Linux programs don't respect the POSIX specifications and install themselves anywhere (don't know if hlds_linux is concerned).

Then of course you'll need to start the server and modify the according rc scripts so that it is restarted each time it crashes.

Yes, file/directory location and how to start the bots since i don't have access to the command line to add the bit i've seen elsewhere in the forums. 

I basically start and stop the hlds proggy through putty.exe with ./hlded.int start, etc. Its a tfc 1.5 linux box with adminmod, hlguard and metamod and all i have is ftp access to my rented directory.

Thanks for the help

Just FTP the following files to the following directories...
code:
HPB_bot_i486.so -> /usr/local/hlds_l/tfc/dlls
HPB_bot.cfg -> /usr/local/hlds_l/tfc
HPB_bot_names.txt -> /usr/local/hlds_l/tfc
HPB_bot_chat.txt -> /usr/local/hlds_l/tfc
HPB_bot_logo.cfg -> /usr/local/hlds_l/tfc
HPB_bot\tfc\*.HPB_wpt -> /usr/local/hlds_l/tfc/maps
HPB_bot\tfc\liblist.gam -> /usr/local/hlds_l/tfc

...then restart your server.  Bots should be added automatically.  See the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file to learn how to change the skill level or add more (or fewer) bots.
