Is it just my bots or on counter strike do the bots just carry pistols...  Unless you die and they pick it up ?  Thats the only problem i see..

Nope, even when you drop a gun directly infornt of one of your team member bots on CS so they pick it up, they still switch bcack to the pistol when they encounter a enemy, from what i,ve seen anyway...
