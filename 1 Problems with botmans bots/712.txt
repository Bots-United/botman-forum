Dunnno if Remote server is the right term! but I have a server that is not on my computer. I have ftp access to it. I can run the bots on MY machine, but installing them on the remote location is pretty tricky! I have tried copying My whole TFC directory and replacing the directory in that FTP access TFC/ file. Still nothing happens. I dunno. The remote server is a company out in nevada, and they dont run the half life game directory, just the HLserver files. So there is no C:/Sierra/Halflife.... its D:/games/servers/ something like that. I only have access to my Directory for TFC..nuttin else. So any ideas?

There's only 3 files you should need.  You will need to copy the HPB_bot.dll file into the MODs dlls directory (D:/games/servers/Half-Life/tfc/dlls or whatever).  You will need to copy the modified liblist.gam file into the MOD directory (D:/games/servers/Half-Life/tfc or whatever).  You will need to copy the bot.cfg file into the MOD directory (same as liblist.gam).

Then when the server is started, it should load the HPB_bot.dll (which will in turn load the MOD dll) and the bots should be spawned based on what's in the bot.cfg file.
