I've heard alot on this forum about the bots crashing, and not working right like they do in 1.0. Should I upgrade, knowing all of these "problems?" Or have they been fixed enough that the bot is stable enough to play a good TFC game? And if I was to download it, do I have to download the TFC, and/or any Half-Life upgrades to make it work? I have 1.5 for TFC, and Half-Life version 1,1,0,4

I just uploaded a new Linux release (version 1.2a) to try to fix the problem that some people are having.

I think there is a difference in how Red Hat Linux (what I use) and other Linuxes (Slackware, etc.) handle null pointer values.  I can't duplicate the crashing problem, but I've made a few code changes to try to prevent null pointers from being accessed.

Just keep your old version around in case there's any problems with the new one.  You can simply rename the old HPB_bot directory to something else before untarring the new release.  If there's problems, use the Remove script to uninstall it, delete the HPB_bot directory, restore the old directory and use the Install script to put it back.

Here's the link to the new Linux release...

I was wondering about the Windows version. What's the lastest version of the HPB Bot for Windows, is it stable enough to play, and what else do I need to make it work? Meaning, updates of TFC, and or Half-Life.

The Win32 1.2 release should work just fine with the latest Half-Life (1.1.0.6), TFC (still 1.5, but new player models), Counter-Strike (1.1), FLF (1.2) and Holy Wars (Beta 1) MODs.  I haven't tested the latest OpFor update (to go along with the 1.1.0.6 HL update) so that one may or may not have some problems.

Sorry Mr. Botman sir. But, will this bot work without having to upgrade, and using the before-current version. Which is 1,1,0,4. I think.

What I'm saying is, do I have to upgrade just to play this new version of the bot?

The latest version of the HPB bot should work with Half-Life version 1.1.0.0 or higher (1.1.0.1, 1.1.0.4, 1.1.0.6).
