I've installed hlds_l, cstrike, and HPB_bot.  I run the server for 16 players, it starts up just fine, 6 bots come online, run around, and talk to each other.

However, after about 5 minutes, the server slowly kicks all the bots off of the server!

Any idea what's going on?

Thanks in advance

Do you have anything else running like AdminMOD or metamod plugins?

Maybe the bots just aren't joining the game properly after a map change.  Do bots get kicked during a round or do they just not join when a new map loads?

I'm certain that at times, bots are not being added on map-start.

However, there are also times when bots get kicked during a map, usually when nobody is playing.

The two areas may be linked, not sure.

The only thing that would cause bots to be kicked during a game is if you have the max_bots enabled and a player joins the server (thus kicking a bot off).  If you don't have a min_bots setting then the bot may not ever get added back to the server.  See the bot.cfg file and HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt for more details about "max_bots" and "min_bots".

ok, that's definitely not what's happening.

I have maxbots set to 6, minbots set to 2.  I've watched the game sit there (with nobody on) and kick all 6 bots off.

I've also gone to play, logged on, and noticed no bots being there, multiple times.  I add bots back to the game, and they seem to play fine for a while (maybe even til the next day), but eventually, i'll find that there are no bots there again, with nobody playing, or with only 1 or 2 people playing.
