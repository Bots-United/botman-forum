OK in another thread Botman told me that he is working on getting the bots to spray logos in the next version when they start building sg's etc. He told me that the logos will come from the /logo directory (you know where the ones that came with the game are). So I brought up a point about the color logos and those being a .wad file that are pre made textures, not .bmp files like the ones that came with the game. I am trying to convince him that basing the logo spray on the pldecal.wad file would be better. Heck, probably easier for botman to set up too. 

What do you guys think, wouldn't it be better if they spray the full color logos that we've all learned to make from reading the color logo tutorial at http://www.cyber-rat.com?

I even offered to make a Botman's Bots color logo that he could use as the default spray for bots. The bots would spray that advertisement unless the server admin changed replaced the pldecal.wad file.

Comments please? I'm hoping enough of you express an interest in this to get Botman's attention. K?

I think you're missing something here.  In order to use a color logo, you have to create the pldecal.wad file using an application that converts the original .bmp or .jpg file to .wad format.

I replied in the other thread about why I want to use the logos folder instead of the pldecal.wad file.

You will be able to do what you want as long as you use a graphics program (like Paint Shop Pro, etc.) to convert .jpg files to .bmp files and copy them to the logos folder.

Read the reply in this thread...

 Wouldnt if they used the pldecal.wad for color logos make them spray the same thing that you have all the time? i mean they run off your computer not their own , so you cant have two color logos in the pldecal.wad so they will be spraying the same thing that you have wich would be lame....

maybe you can make a file that has pldecals in it but named different, then at random each bot would pick on and name it placedecal. would that work?

pldecal.wad (stands for PLayer DECAL), gets recreated when you select the decal you want.  pldecal.wad will only contain 1 decal.  If you add other decals to this file they will get lost when the player selects a new decal (the Half-Life engine will recreate this file with 1 decal only).

pldecal.wad is ONLY used by the client when connecting to the server.  The server does not need or use this file.  When the player connects to the server the decal is sent via a network message and gets cached in the server's list of player decals.  You have to have a client in order to sent the engine a player decal.  Bots don't have a client and therefore CAN'T send the engine a player decal.  This network message is not something that the SDK has access to (it is an internal engine network message similar to the "ping" command).

Bot's can do one of three things...

1. Use the default Half-Life Lamda symbol decal (found when using FakeClientCommand("impulse 201")).

2. Bots can use the decal of a human player (by specifying the index of that player's decal).

3. Bots can use other methods of spraying a decal that doesn't require human players to be on the server.

The problem with #1 is that all bots would use the same decal and same color.  This is boring.

The problem with #2 is that bots could only use the same decal (and color) that a player is using.  Also boring.

I choose to use method #3 to have the bots randomly pick a decal from the logos folder (with a few randomly selected colors) and use that as a spray logo.

Forget about trying to use pldecal.wad.  That file works fine for real players, but bots AREN'T real players!

Erm, botman, how are you converting the .bmp files from the logos folder to work with the Half-Life engine?

ok, i got it now. the bots can only have 1 pldecal... aha. i guess you're gonna have to do the old 1 color logos... sure is a bummer.

"Erm, botman, how are you converting the .bmp files from the logos folder to work with the Half-Life engine?"

They'll be converted internally to cached decals.

"ok, i got it now. the bots can only have 1 pldecal... aha. i guess you're gonna have to do the old 1 color logos... sure is a bummer."

No, if I used pldecal.wad then the bots would only be able to select that one spray logo (monochrome or color depending on how you created it).  I'm NOT using pldecal.wad so I don't have to live with the restriction of all the bots using the same logo.

The bots WILL randomly select logos from the logos folder.  If .bmp files in the folder are monochrome then they will be used with randomly selected color.  If the .bmp files are NOT monochrome then they will be used AS IS (with the color palette in the .bmp file unchanged).

 ok i see , too bad they cant use the pldecal though , they randomly pick through the logos and colors for them? does that mean they randomly pick through the default logos that came with the game or all of them, say you put more in there? would be better to have more than original logos that were in there.

so your saying that the pldecal.wad is totally different than the logos from the logos folder? i thought when you picked a logo from the folder it still came from the pldecal.wad

 did you read what he said or just skim through it? he said that pldecal uses .wad file and normal ones use .bmp files

Okay, ONE MORE TIME...

FORGET about pldecal.wad, I'm not using it.

If there is a .bmp file in the Half-Life\logos folder (original file from the game or one that you have added) the bots will use it as a spray logo.

If the .bmp file is in color, the bots will spray it in color (unmodified).

If the .bmp file is monochrome (not in color), then the bots will choose a random color for it (just like you can do in the Customize menu when you select a spray logo) and will use that color when spraying the logo.

WHY IS THIS SO DAMNED HARD TO UNDERSTAND???

OK, I am not sure if you know how color logos are made or ever made one so I'll pretend you haven't. When making a pldecal file it is converted from a bmp file. Any full blue entries in the bmp are converted to transparent in the logo texture. Does this mean if I take that bmp file that I used to create the texture with the bots that they will be able to spray that full color logo with transparencies in game same as I spray the pldecal.wad of the same? If so that will be the exact same, won't it? 

Thanks for explaining. Sounds like it will do just what I wanted it to do.

Yes, if you take the .bmp file you originally used to create pldecal.wad and copy that file into the Half-Life\logos folder then the bots will use it as is (with pure blue (r=0, g=0, b=255) being transparent).

And, like I said above, if you don't want the bots to use the monochrome .bmp files just delete them from the Half-Life\logos folder.
