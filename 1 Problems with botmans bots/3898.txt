Botman, perhaps reference a thread on hlds_linux mailing list titled high cpu usage from last couple days. 

My testing seems to be demonstrating that HPB_bot is using more than 50% of a 400mhz celeron with rh8 at 4 bots while similar system at 533mhz and rh7.3 is using less than 1% both with 4 bots. With no bots the 400 uses 20-30% with bot dll loaded and uses 1-5% without bot dll loaded. under rh 7.3 this is not the case, a 533 celeron uses less than 1% with 4 bots. similar results with dod and sturmbot but since their code is based on yours I figure its related. haven't tested fully yet. Need to get a few real players in there with no bot dll loaded to get a better picture. Just a heads up.

Hmmm, interesting.  I no longer subscribe to the hlds or hlds_linux mailing list since I don't really have the time to read 100+ e-mail messages every day.

If there's a thread you want me to look at, just post the URL of the thread from the list.valvesoftware.com mailing list.
