Subject: DLL error during detach

I've been using www.acquerra.com.au/personal/bird/bbm/Birds Bot Manager to write bots.  BBM is adapted from the HPB source code.  I'd ask the author for help, but he wrote BBM for Linux and I'm using a VC++ port.  Anyway, I hope this is the right forum for posting this message.

BBM.dll is playing the man-in-the-middle.  It works fine except when I quit from HL, in which case a dialog appears with "HL has caused an error in BBM.dll.  HL will now close."  This occurs in Windows 98/ME but not NT/2000.

I tried putting in assert(0) statements to isolate the error.  The error seems to occur shortly after DllMain() gets the message DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:

code:

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
   if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
   {
   }
   else if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH)
   {
      if (h_Library) FreeLibrary(h_Library);

      if (h_global_argv)
      {
         GlobalUnlock(h_global_argv);
         GlobalFree(h_global_argv);
      }
      assert(0);
   }

   return TRUE;
}



Does anyone know how I can get the man-in-the-middle DLL to exit more gracefully?  I'd be happy to share the VC++ source code.

Try removing the FreeLibrary Call. AFAIK Win98 doesn't allow freeing the Library while you're still in the process. Works with NT though...
