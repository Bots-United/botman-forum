There is a big story now in the states about Saddam Husein Buying Playstation 2's so that the Iraqi army can use them for evil purposes.  Then i was thinking "What if Saddam got his hands on the source code for the high ping bot and compiled his own evil bot and then intsalled that program into some insect like drones?"  We would all be in big trouble then.

whoever took me seriously is an idiot, you guys need to lighten up.  And no one is whining in here, so since you just mentioned that forum your post should be deleted.
