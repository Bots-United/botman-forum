Move the "gearbox" directory into your "C:\SIERRA\Half-Life" and it should work.  If all you have is OpFor (and not Half-Life) just unzip the HPB_bot into the folder used by Opposing Force.  I don't have the OpFor standalone version so I can't tell you what that directory name would be.  Search for a "gearbox" folder to find where it is.
