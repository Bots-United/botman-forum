Okay, I'm just going to check if this is just me. It seems that every time my map changes (and this is ever since I've installed HPB_bot) a good number of my users get booted--but not booted, they just timeout. They tell me that they got disconnected, that their HL went back to the multiplayer screen. I thought that it might be client-side, but it happens to about eight people per map, and it happens routinely.

Also, min_bots and max_bots used to work correctly, but now they seem a bit funky--that is, the bots don't come back when people leave. They used to. Maybe I just need to reinstall.

Oh well. I hope that you can help with the timeout problem. Thanks. :-)

I don't think its the bots, i have heard many people complain of this lately and have seen it happen to my co-worker alot in the last week or two where it never happened to him before.  I would say that the new server patch is the culprit.

I've seen it through the last several server patches so I think it's existed for quite some time. It has even timed ME out from my own server, considering I am on the LAN with the server I find it hard to believe there wasn't enough bandwidth. There wasn't any other activity on my network when it happens other than normal (ie game, web, ftp servers).
