They do go onto a team, but their name isnt listed under the team they joined (you can tell that they joined if they have a class name by the name of the bot)

The only time that I have seen this is when you kick a bot from the server and then try to add a bot back to the server.  The bot will stay "unassigned" until the next map change.  I haven't figured out what causes this problem yet.  If you intend to add the bot back, don't kick it off.

If you aren't kicking the bot then adding it back and they still don't join, please let me know what it is you are doing when they show up as "unassigned".

i guess i was kicking it, but then i wanted to add it to the other team, for more of a challange, more againsed just me. so your saying that if i just change their name they would go onto the team? im going to try it out right now.

Once I start kicking bots the only way I can sucessfully add them back is to restart the map first

So is it possible to change team for a bot without kicking it first?

I have found out that the bot that joins after the kicked bot doesn't get the team select message.
