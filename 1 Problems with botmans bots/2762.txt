Hi
I basically want to play a lan game with friends
and use the server to play on as well (non dedicated I believe), but after setting this up via the HL/CS menus it bombs out saying that I don't have an "mp.dll" file. It's correct, I don't have it in that folder or anywhere else for that matter. Am I missing something here, like I can't run lan games with the dowloaded CS 1.3 version? My HL version is the latest (1108), which was purchased but not the copy of CS.

The second problem :-
I just download and installed POD-bot 2.5, all went well untill I tried to use it. After I created a lan game and clicked the ok it bombed out pretty much straight away. I checked the 
PODERROR.txtfile in the HL folder and it says :-
"Podbot couldn't find the CounterStrike DLL!"
"Podbot couldn't find GetEntityAPI!"
I also checked the liblist.gam and as expected has been modifed, one of the lines being :-
"gamedll "podbot\podbot.dll". The podbot.dll is in the correct folder!

Any ideas on the above welcome
Thanks

Somehow you deleted the Half-Life\cstrike\dlls\mp.dll file (which is the game DLL code for Counter-Strike).

You will need to reinstall Counter-Strike to fix this problem.  After reinstalling CS, you will then have to reinstall the bot that you want to use.

Yep, you're absolutely right. The version of CS 1.3 I had (even though is was 78mb) didn't have the mp.dll in it. I downloaded a 100mb exe version from a more recongoised site and that did contain it. All is working as it should now, thank you.
