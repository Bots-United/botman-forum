Which bot are you using for Wasteland?

The HPB bot doesn't support the Wasteland MOD if you are using the HPB bot.

This may be because, the bots were coded by someone other than botman. The command used to add bots may be something different to "addbot". You shoudl find the website about this bot or read the readme file :)

It's also a problem that the support is up to a certain version of Wasteland (beta 2).

Probably that later versions aren't supported anymore.
