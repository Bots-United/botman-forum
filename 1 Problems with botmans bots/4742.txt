Subject: Duplicate bot name problem

I've been running botman's hpb_bot on my server for almost a week, and it hasn't crashed once. That says a lot! I used to run OZ for the rho-bots, but there are some bugs in the current version, and the developers aren't sure when the next version will be out.

Anyhow - great bots - but I get duplicate bot names. For example, right now I have 4 bots in my server:

KillKill
KillKill(1)
KillKill(2)
CrowBarKiller

I run a maximum of 4 bots. My HPB_bot_names.txt has only 6 names in it because those are the only names I want the bots to use. How can I prevent duplicate bot names?

The HPB_bot randomly chooses a name among the names list when you add a bot without any parameter -well, at least, it was this way the last time I looked into the HPB_bot source, which scrolls time up to quite a good couple of months ago. If you've got only 6 names in your bot names list, IMO the best way to ensure you won't get duplicated names would be to extend your names list. The more names you'll have in this list, the less chances are that your bots will get duplicated names.

OK, just saw there has been a change in the latest versions of the HPB_bot. There's now a BotPickName() function which purpose is to prevent newly added bots to take the name of an already existing bot. The problem is that, if a bot disconnects for whatever reason, its name is still marked as used. Or if there's a map change, the bot name remains marked as used as well. So if you want this behaviour to be fixed, I suppose you'll have to ask botman for a fix. Else I could eventually send you a source code patch, provided you know how to compile the bot DLL. I can't send you a DLL, for I only have the metamod version of the HPB_bot along the list of my plugins here.

Thanks for your kind offer. I think in this case, it would be easier to just extend my botname list. At least I know what is causing it :)
