Subject: hlds_l doesn't read bot.cfg
--------------------------------------------------

I understand that the server is supposed to read the bot.cfg file on startup. I'm using a Linux dedicated server and it doesn't read the bot.cfg file, i.e. it doesn't add bots or set the max_bots/min_bots variables. This is with HPB_bot version 1.5a and 1.3. Is there a way to have it execute the bot.cfg file?

Also, botman, could you change the bot command to be a proper server command instead of a CVAR?

Have you run the Install script file to install the bot in the MOD directory?  The Install script file is located in the MOD directory below the hlds_l/HPB_bot directory (i.e. hlds_l/HPB_bot/tfc/Install).  This should put the HPB bot .so file in the MOD's dlls directory and copy the bot.cfg, bot_chat.txt, bot_names.txt, and the modified liblist.gam files into the MOD directory.  Then when you start the dedicated server, it will open the bot.cfg and execute the bot commands.

Yes, I could modify things to make the bot commands be registered server commands.  I'll still leave the old bot CVAR for backward compatibility though.

Yes. Well, I have set it up manually, but the installation is correct. The bots work and the server could find the bot.cfg file if he wanted to. I can have it executed with exec, which means it is in the right spot.

Nope. That is exactly my problem. It doesn't get read. Is the file parsed by the bot dll itself or exec'd by the engine? I guess the bot dll interpretes the commands, doesn't it? So using 'bot addbot' in the bot.cfg wouldn't help.

It also doesn't say "executing bot.cfg" like I read somewhere that it should. (I'm currently talking about version 1.3). The waypoint files get loaded so I guess it should also be able to _find_ the bot.cfg file.

The file is parsed by the HPB bot .so code.  Using "exec" to execute the file will do nothing.

When you say you manually set up the files, did you copy the correct liblist.gam to the hlds_l/tfc directory?

If you start up hlds_run and redirect the output to a file you should see this...

Adding:  tfc/dlls/HPB_bot_i486.so

...in the startup sequence.  If you don't see that, then you don't have things installed correctly.

Is there some reason you didn't want to run the Install script?

Okay, here is the full story. I'm trying to look into crashes caused by the combination of bots and Adminmod. I know that the adminmod commands work fine with bots if adminmods bot protection is turned on, because I have tested them with HPB bots on my test server at home. I also had my test server run for three hours with adminmod and bots without any difficulties. But reports have it that an Internet server tends to crash after some time. 

There must be multiple factors coming together which cause this crashes. That is why I tried to set up HPB bot on an Internet server, to see if I can recreate any crashes. And it does crash, for no apparent reason. The server gets restarted if it crashes, but since it doesn't read the bot.cfg file, it will have no more bots on it. That is bad.

I have copied all files except for the liblist.gam file, in order not to mess the one up, that is already installed. But I know my way with liblist.gam files, so it should be fine.

I have tried HBP bot with adminmod, with only metamod but adminmod disabled and without any of the two and only the bots. It simply doesn't read the bot.cfg file. I've tried it on my test LAN server at home and it doesn't read the bot.cfg file. It doesn't complain about it not being there either. Do you have a debug setting which would produce debug messages from HPB bot? Or maybe you utilize the engine's +developer CVAR? 

I know that the bot dll is loaded. I can see it in the server console and the logs and I can add bots with 'bot addbot'. It simply doesn't read the bot.cfg at startup. Well, I don't know if it reads it or not, but I do know that the server doesn't add bots on it own so I assume that it doesn't read the bot.cfg file.

How to you find the path of the file? Do you use LoadFileForMe() or do you get the path with GetGameDir() and read it on yourself? Or is the path dependant on the location of the bot dll? I don't know why it won't execute the bot.cfg file. Have you ever had it working on a Linux system? It's a Mandrake system, btw. Maybe you used some libc functions in a unusual fashion? There was a bug in adminmod related to sprintf() function which showed up only on Mandrake system. Must have been something with their implementation of glibc.

--------------------------------------------------
The path is generated based on what the MOD is detected as.  The MOD is detected using pfnGetGameDir() which will return something like "/usr/games/hlds_l/tfc".  The HPB bot strips off the leading part of the path, leaving "tfc" as the starting directory path.

The "/bot.cfg" gets appended to this path (i.e. it will be "tfc/bot.cfg".  The HPB bot code tries to load that file and, if it is able to open the file, will execute the commands within it.

I would recommend that you remove the files that you manually copied, copy the AdminMOD version of liblist.gam to liblist.sav, then use the Install script to install the HPB bot.  Once you have done this you can rename liblist.sav back to liblist.gam (restoring the Admin MOD version).

The set up MetaMOD to work with bots and start up the server.  That will make sure that everything is in the directory that it is supposed to be in.

So you are using -dev for debug messages? Looks like it. At least it tells me that the bot.cfg file is read: "Executing valve/bot.cfg". Apparently it gets read in ServerActivate(), but only once. 

Okay, then the question is, why doesn't it work? I was under the impression that the bots get added right after server start if there are addbot commands in the bot.cfg. But that doesn't work. The server will just happily sit there and do nothing. I even used your Install script now, which didn't change anything. No bots get loaded.

While I'm at it, here is something else you should have a look after. Using this will crash the server due to a dereferenced NULL pointer:
bot max_bots

I gues you are trying to read the parameter for max_bots, but there is none. Maybe this wasn't intended but I thought it would be used rather often to check the setting for max_bots. AT least this is the most intuitive way for me.

--------------------------------------------------
06/23/01 at 04:35:55  Reply by: botman (botman@mailandnews.com)
--------------------------------------------------
Yes, you get more output on the console with the "-dev" command line argument.

"I gues you are trying to read the parameter for max_bots"

Yes, max_bots is a write-only variable and it is expecting an argument (leading to the crash).  I just didn't expect people to be changing it more than once (in the bot.cfg file) so I never added any code to display the setting.  I suppose I could do that.

I'm not sure why you aren't getting bots added to your game.  If you use the default bot.cfg and have the .so and liblist.gam installed correctly, the bots should get added automatically about 20 or 30 seconds after the map starts.

I build and run the HPB bot on a RedHat 6.2 Linux system.  It's a 166Mhz Pentium CPU, but I can run about 8 or 10 bots on it.

I'm not sure that this really matters, but which MOD are you trying to run?

I'm absolutely sure that the .so and the liblist.gam are installed correctly. The bot.cfg also gets execed, or so it says in the logs. Only the bots don't get spawned. I'm using the default bot.cfg with six addbot commands. I have tried to play with max_/min_bots instead and also with the pause command, but to no avail.

The 20-30 seconds thing was new to me. But it still doesn't work. The bots never get loaded automatically. Is the adding of the bots timer triggered? I see that the bot.cfg is read at the first call to ServerActivate(). But that is not the server that the bots will be added to. 

I have tried the bots on HLDM and TFC. Same results.

There is a slight delay if you have a max_bots setting to allow real human players to join the game after a map change (but it's only about 20 or 30 seconds) which is not enough time for many players to rejoin a server on the Internet after a map change.

It will say "Executing bot.cfg" even if the bot.cfg file doesn't exist (of course it will then say "bot.cfg file not found" if there isn't a bot.cfg file).

You should try manually adding bots to the game.  Just use "bot addbot" at the dedicated server console.  If you don't see a bot show up in the list of players when you use the "status" or "stat" command then I have no idea what the problem is.

I have never tested on Mandrake Linux, or SuSe or Slackware or anything other than RedHat.  I believe that there are people runing the HPB bot on Slackware, but I don't know if any of the other Linux distributions work with the HPB bot or not.

I have the same problem and its also discussed on the halfd forum (www.halfd.org).  It seems to be a problem with halfd as well as AdminMod.  

I was able to get the min/max settings to work by making a map_bot.cfg (using the map name e.g. de_dust_bot.cfg) for each map.  In this case the bots will load.  Plus you can use different max and min settings for each map.

BTW are you still using hlds_l? not halfd?

I'm running RH 7.1 on an overclocked Celeron@550MHz.

As I stated before, adding bots from the server console works. The max_/min_bots settings also work. The only thing that does not work is the execution of the bot.cfg file. I'll try it on a different Linux distro to see if it is specific to Mandrake. Is the bot.cfg part in the source code that you have released? I may have a look then. I guess recompiling the source is no good since it is missing the AI part, huh?

Phil, it cannot be a problem of hlafd or Adminmod, since I tried it with neither installed and it still didn't work. And I am using neither hlds_ld nor halfd. I wrote hlds_l to make clear that I am talking about the Linux server. Not hlds_ld.

Yes, the HPB bot template code contains the exact same source code that I am using to load and execute the commands in the bot.cfg file.  Look at the dll.cpp for the code.  Just search for "bot.cfg" and you should find where the file gets opened.

Never mind, I found it. I hereby officially declare that I don't get how this is supposed to work. This is how I see it:

First server is created.

DispatchSpawn() is called with worldspawn and the bot_cfg_pause_time is set to zero.

First server is activated.

StartFrame() is called and the bot.cfg is opened. bot_cfg_pause_time is set to gpGlobals->time + 5.0 (dedicated server).

This is the line that keeps the code from processing the bot.cfg file since bot_cfg_pause_time is larger than gpGlobals->time

 if ((bot_cfg_fp) &&
             (bot_cfg_pause_time >= 1.0) && (bot_cfg_pause_time <= gpGlobals->time))

So far so good.

First server gets deactivated.

First server gets closed.

Second server gets created.

DispatchSpawn() gets called with worldspawn and set bot_cfg_pause_time to 0.

Second server gets activated.

Here is the problem. Since bot_cfg_pause_time got reset to 0, the opened bot.cfg file will never get processed; ProcessBotCfgFile() is never called.

What am I missing?

--------------------------------------------------
This simple addition would remedy the situation:

in dll.cpp::DispatchSpawn() replace

bot_cfg_pause_time = 0.0;

with

if ( !bot_cfg_fp ) bot_cfg_pause_time = 0.0;

But I haven't tried it extensively, i.e. I don't know if it has a negative impact on the map specific .cfg files. And I still wonder why it works for most people. I suppose listenservers start right in the first server instance?

I'm not sure what you mean by this...

First server gets deactivated. 

First server gets closed. 

Second server gets created. 

DispatchSpawn() gets called with worldspawn and set bot_cfg_pause_time to 0. 

Second server gets activated.

...what is "First server" and "Second server"?  Are you talking about the bot.cfg file not being used when anything other than the first map is loaded?  If so, it is supposed to do that.  Since bots that existed during the previous map will be respawned when the next map starts, if you execute the bot.cfg file again when the second map spawns you will add more bots.  When the third map loads you will add even more bots, etc.

I am talking about a Linux dedicated server because I have never seen any other. If you start a Linux HLDS and watch the server console, you will notice that multiple server instances are created before the HLDS accepts connections. By server I mean a server instance listed in the console with "server spawned" or "server closed" and activated by ServerActivate(). 

When you join a Linux HLDS with a client, you will never see the server instance listed as #1. The server instance is listed in the client console during connection. Something like Server #x blah. Joining a freshly started HLDS will list the server #2, i.e. the second server instance. That is why I said "first server", "second server". The first server instance will be closed before HPB bot can process the  bot.cfg file. It lives for only two to three frames. If you like, I can send you a console log of a Linux HLDS starting.

8 player server started

execing server.cfg
Sys_InitializeGameDLL called twice, skipping second call                             


But thanks to your post I found out why that is! Thanks a lot for that. I guess you could call it my fault. I use a '+exec autoexec.cfg' on the command line to make sure that the server executes that file. I guess I must have had problems with that with older server versions. Well, this causes the second server to get spawned since the autoexec.cfg is read twice now. I'll have to use that differently, then.

But I still think it would be good if you changed the code to safeguard against overcautious people like me. :)

Thanks a lot for your help!

You don't happen to have a "map" command in the server.cfg or bot.cfg file by any chance do you?  That would cause the problem that you are seeing (if you have a "map" command in the bot.cfg file before the "addbot" commands).

No, the map command is in the autoexec.cfg file. If I had a map command in the server.cfg file, that would mess up the server. The autoexec.cfg looks like this:

maxplayers 8
log on
map boot_camp

Apparently it gets read twice. First automatically by the server and then again because I had it on the command line. If I remove it from the command line, only one server is spawned at startup and the bot .so has enough time to create the bots.

You could account for cases like mine by making sure that the bot_cfg_pause_time isn't reset to tero before the .cfg file has been processed, like I did in the snippet above. This works for me, using only one bot.cfg file.
