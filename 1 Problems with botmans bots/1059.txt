This may have been posted before but i could not find it... When I add bots sometimes they just stay dead without ever joining a team.. even if i specify a team..

I would appreciate anyone telling me how i can fix this?

Thank you

The HPB bot has this problem in TFC if you kick a bot then try to add a bot to the game.  The bot will stay unassigned.  The only "fix" for this is to change maps (the bots will disconnect and reconnect properly).  You could always change to the same map if you want to continue playing that map.

How do go about doing that? Mapchange? Or closing the server and running the level again?

The 2nd thing sometimes leads to the game ternimating on me, during the game.

Just bring down the console and type...

map mapname

...or...

changelevel mapname

...where mapname is the name of the map you wish to load (without the .bsp extension).

Hmm, still something wrong...

i did as you said and it worked the first time, but never again.  About four terrorists would join with me as a counter-terrorist and the rest would sit in lobmo and watch, when i added another counter-terrorist two of the bots stuck in lombo joined the terrorist team but adding a third counter-terrorist did nothing.  This has been repeated many times on my LAN.

btw, I set mp_autoteambalance to 0 so that i could play alone against many bots.

Thank you again

Oh, you're trying to play Counter-Strike.  CS isn't fully supported by the HPB bot.  I suggest you download another bot that was written specifically for Counter-Strike.  See my "Links" page for URLs to CS bot websites...

I had tons of probs with bots joining the right team. I ended up making a cfg file for every map I run. I actually like it better that way, way more control. I like to have only 4 bots on my server (an internet server btw). I like to have 2 per team and have them mirrored (ie if there is a sniper and hwguy on one team then there are same on other). This way I can configure exactly what I want for each map including skill, class, name etc.

If you want a GOOD bot to work in CS, get the PodBot! It RULES!
