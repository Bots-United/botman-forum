Trying to get HPBBot to work with steam..I have an updated dll so that isn't my problem.

I have HPB_Bot.dll, HPB_Bot1.dll (renamed the old DLL that comes with 3.0) and mp.dll in /dlls directory. My problem is that when I have liblist.gam using HPB_Bot.dll or HPB_Bot1.dll as the gamedll, when I try to create a server (map de_blahblah in console or new game on the GUI) it freezes at that point, won't load into the game, just get a HL Launcher error crash. If I change liblist to point to mp.dll it loads into the game fine, but of course HPB Bot doesn't work then.

Just wondering if anyone knows why it freezes or what I need to change with liblist.gam to get it to load into game.

edit: this is for cstrike, sorry forgot to add that

yes, I'm using that dll, but when I add it to liblist as the game dll cs freezes when I click start game, works fine with mp.dll

Does it work with a dedicated server ?
