HPBot rocks, don't get me wrong, but here are some things I'd like to see in a bot that you probably couldn't do...or could you?

1.) Spy bots that take on a random enemy diguise and sneak into the other team's base and sneak up behind people and take em out, or when you play as a spy and run into the other team's base, random bots who fire on you just to see if you're on their team or not, and if you aren't they try to take you out

2.) Engineer bots who experiment with DG placement, instead of just randomly plug in a SG wherever they are standing when they stop running

3.) Sniper bots who miss occasionally :)

It's been talked about before, there are alot of random, unpredictable elements in online gaming that will never translate into bots, or at least not anytime soon.  In the Badlands, bots seem to take the bridge route 98% of the time, where in online play a lot of people will take the canyon, stuff like that.

I did an experiment on 2Fort where I was the only person on Team 1 and I put all 31 bots on Team 2 as snipers.  It was just too funny to see 20-25 bots standing in the in the middle of the upper level on the other team's base, all of them waiting to shoot.  One bot grabbed my flag and got it back to his base, but wasnt able to actually capture it because almost every other sniper was hanging out on the capture point on their side.

Overall tho, great bot all things considered.  Keep up the good work, I look forward to seeing more.

Try using "Delete user" in the "Change profile" thing and recreate your username.
