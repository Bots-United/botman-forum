Right now we're using the ABot forum at waypoint warehouse, http://waypointwarehouse.com

I've got a few suggestions there (some BIG ones added today) so any fans of the ABot head down there and contribute. You might find my posts a bit....involved, especially if you don't waypoint maps and have never used the visit waypoint. But try.
