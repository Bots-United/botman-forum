It seems that bot-teamplay don't work if map has "mapteams"-var set in "worldspawn"-ent.

That's probably true.  You could always turn on mp_teamplay.

?!
mp_teamplay == 1
-->
mapteams: grunt;massn
manual teams: fassn;scientist
-->
in game teams == mapteams
-->
bots think that they are in same team!

Ok .. I'll try again .. "mp_teamplay" is set "1"!!

I set teams manually to "zombie;massn" and load map that has "mapteams"-set to "hgrunt;scientist" in "worldspawn"-ent. 

Game-dll uses "hgrunt;scientist" for this game but HPB_bot uses "zombie;massn" --> HPB_bot doesn't work right.
