Just in case people have trouble getting the HPB Bot to work on TEAMPLAY Recongamer servers for HLDM-type mods, here's how to do it:

Put the hpb bot config files in the valve folder (ie. hpb_bot.cfg, hpb_bot_names.cfg, etc).  Edit them to your liking.

Create a folder somewhere for the bot DLL file.  If you have adminmod/metamod, make a folder off of the addons folder, 

ie. /valve/addons/hpb_bot/hpb_bot.dll

Stick the hpb_bot.dll file in the folder as shown above.

On the server, create an autoexec.cfg if you dont have one, right in the valve folder.  In that file put this line

localinfo mm_gamedll "addons/hpb_bot/hpb_bot.dll"

Create a file in the valve folder called "game.cfg".

In this file insert these two lines

mp_teamplay 1301
mp_teamlist "a;b;c;d;e;f"

... where a through f are random models that you wish to use.  IMPORTANT: YOU CANNOT USE MORE THAN 6 MODELS!!! (unless Botman fixes something in the future hehe)

Save that file.

Start your server...

Your bots should jump on and start fragging.

Good luck!!!  E-mail me if you need help, I dont mind helping, since bots are such a huge pain in the ass to setup on Recongamer since we dont have access to the commandline.

Just a bump.
I know people are reading this and getting their bots working on Recongamer and want to keep it near the top :)
