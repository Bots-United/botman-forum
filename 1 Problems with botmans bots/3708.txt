You either don't have BotMixer5000 installed correctly or you have some other problem with your Half-Life installation.

Try uninstalling Half-Life, delete the Half-Life directory (to get rid of any remaining files).  Reinstall Half-Life, update to the latest version (1.1.1.0), install the MODs you wish to use, install the bots you wish to use, and LAST OF ALL, install the BotMixer5000.

Make ABSOLUTELY SURE you install BotMixer5000 LAST or things won't work right.  You MUST also remove BotMixer5000 if you want to uninstall a bot or install a new bot, then you MUST install BotMixer5000 LAST after changing bots.

Start it up and look in the lower right corner of the main menu.

The latest version is 1.1.1.0
