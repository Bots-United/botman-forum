--------------------------------------------------
If you are having problems with the HPB bot crashing could you please post the following information...

1) Does the HPB bot crash on every map or just specific ones?

2) Which map were you running when the bot crashed?

3) How long were you running this map before the crash?

4) Where did the waypoint file for this map come from?  What is the size and date/time of this waypoint file?  (Right click on the file in Windows Explorer and select Properties for the size in bytes).

5) What error message (if any did you get when the crash occurred).  When the crash occurs, cutting-and-pasting the error message into a text file that can be posted later in this forum would be helpful.

If I can identify what is causing the crashes for everyone then maybe I can fix the problem since I can't seem to be able to duplicate the problem on my PC at home or at work.

Thanks.

quoting myself from the waypointwarehouse forum....

"Yeah it happened to me on 2fort and well even, on well i was using cheesemonster's waypoints. On 2fort i used botman's it also seems to happen to me on epicenter with which i have only tried with my waypoints, i dunno what the heck is going on but i hope botman can fix it."

To answer your first ques. I have also had a crash on hunted.. I've been busy mucking around with my other computer, so i'll try and play the other maps useing the waypoints that came with HPB v4.2a and see what happens.

2) 2fort
3) I believe about a little over 10mins the first run and a little over 23mins the second run

4) BOTH crashes occured useing 2fort.wpt that was included with release of HPB_Bot 4.2a Dated - Saturday, October 07, 2000 5:51:22 PM

5) I probably would'nt have recieved any message and just have been booted back to windows. That is what happened in previous crashes.

Here are my Dr. Watson message's" (Note that i was useing MBL to launch both times. I really don't think it hurts anything as i can edit my 2fort_bot.cfg to add the current commands. However, next time around i will try without MBL).

Also botman, i sent you an instant YaBB message where you can find the link to download the 2 above Dr. Watson files..  I think it sent it?

Okay, that does help.  I'm convinced that I've got a bug somewhere in the waypoint code (trying to access invalid memory address), but I haven't been able to find it yet.

I was kinda hoping that everyone had problems on the same maps (using the same waypoint file, possibly corrupted?), but it looks like it's happening on at least 3 different maps...

2FORT
WELL
EPICENTER

Has anyone had it crash on maps other than these?

keola, EAX isn't the 3D sound stuff it's one of the Intel processor registers.  There's EAX, EBX, ECX and EDX.  These are all 32 bit registers for holding data.

Okay, Grubber's Dr. Watson log helped quite a bit!  ;)

After a quick analysis it looks like it's crashing in the BotThink() code, not in the waypoint navigation code.  The problem was a NULL pointer when trying to do a string initialization.  I suspect this problem is in the bot_whine code somewhere.

Grubber, can you try something for me to attempt to confirm this?  Try deleting the bot_whine.txt file from the tfc folder and run several different maps (2FORT should be one of them).  See if you can run for several hours (you don't have to be there the whole time) without the bots crashing.

I think the reason I haven't been seeing the crashes is I almost never have time to run the bots for more than 20 or 30 minutes at a time, so it may be something that only happens after the bots have been playing for a while.  Deleting the bot_whine.txt file will prevent it from executing some of the code that copies text strings.  If this doesn't prevent the crashes then it could be happening somewhere else in the BotThink() code.

Sure botman! I can do that!! 
Umm i was offline there for a little cuz the telephone had to be used and in that time i tried launched Half-Life without MBL and i played 2fort and Casbah useing the waypoints that came with v4.2a and had a time of 30 for both before map change, well, they both played out successfully. Hmmm? Ummm, i was gunna use Fred - Author of MBL as my scapegoat, BUT until iread what botman has posted i guess that's not a good idea.. hehe Plus Fred has released an updated version that supports 4.2 .. DOH! hehe .. Ok, i will try what botman has said!

The above was done useing v4.2a
Casbah - Thursday, October 26, 2000 6:40:12 PM
2fort - Saturday, October 07, 2000 5:51:22 PM

I'll still NOT use MBL when play testing.. Later i'll download the new version and check it out. My current version of MBL is only upgraded to v9.1 .. 

---Modified---
Ok, so far after deleting the bot_whine.txt, i've done 3 map change's successfully! No problems, so far.. I started with 2fort, push, now it's playing 2fort agian.. I didn't look at my mapcycle, all i did was to add all of the current 4.2a waypoints and let it play.
Oh, yes, maps are running at 60 .. If you would like me to increase the time NP... I'm on my other system as not to intterupt those hard bot fraggin HPBer's lol! I think they need to be learned a lesson!
So i'm going to frag those lonely SOB'S.. They think they own... NOT...!! hehehe... 8)

MBL was NOT used!
All map specific files were used for each individual map. Here is exactly what they consistied of:
http://grubber.hypermart.net/Waypoints/map-specific.txt
===================================
Here are all the maps that i put into my mapcycle:

push - Saturday, October 07, 2000 6:07:44 PM 5kb
2fort - Saturday, October 07, 2000 5:51:22 PM 9kb (Played twice)
crossover2 - Saturday, October 07, 2000 6:02:52 PM 8kb
casbah - Thursday, October 26, 2000 6:40:12 PM 5kb
avanti - It played even though i just realized there's no wpt's.. hehe 0kb
epicenter - Sunday, October 29, 2000 10:52:04 AM 6kb
badlands - Monday, October 02, 2000 7:23:58 PM 10kb
rock2 - Sunday, October 08, 2000 9:49:52 AM 10kb
hunted - Sunday, October 29, 2000 1:44:42 PM 4kb

Play Tested from 8:30 am Till 6:45 pm .. The time for each was set at 60.000000 .. (With the bot_whine.txt deleted)
I was told that the bot's were on rock2, at the time the computer was shut down (Can't even go to the bar for a half hour,
without somebody always turning off my dam computer)!
So which means, (I'm guessing) that hunted wasn't played.. botman, if you would like me to do it over i will .. 

So in closeing, "there were NO crashes"!! Cuz my Drwatson directory in Windows has NO new records..
Even when i was playing with the bot's, i seen nothing strange.

Was this a satisfactory test? Or would you like me to up the time and do it all over?
If not, is there anything else i could try for you?

FoXBot was NOT or has NOT been installed since my deleteing of Half-Life and Re-Installing on Friday, February 02, 2001 9:24:26 AM .. At the moment, the only other bot that is installed is Oddbot v1.3 .. 

ps, Ahhh, revenge for those that had turned off my computer has just occured on Monday, February 05, 2001 7:38 PM 
in the form of gas.. quote - Nerve_gas_released!! ROTFL!!! I wish all could have heard the ARG'S going down.. - Like when the medic infect's.. Drinking & Eating correctly at the bar forms the most rosey smell... 8)

"So in closeing, "there were NO crashes"!"

Okay, thanks.  That confirms my guess about the bot_whine stuff causing crashes.  There may be other places crashes occur but no one has sent me a Dr. Watson log showing these.  Probably because I haven't asked for one!  :)

I ran my server last night using 2FORT, BADLANDS, PUSH, and CROSSOVER2.  Each game was set for 2 hours (120 minutes).  I ran with the standard bot_whine.txt file to see if any crashes occurred.  No crashes occurred with the standard bot_whine.txt file.  I tried adding blank lines to the bot_whine.txt file and changed the game time to 60 minutes.  No crashes had occurred within the first 2 hours.  I'll check it again when I get home tonight.

I did find 1 bug in the bot_whine stuff last night.  If a player kills a bot and the bot decides to use the say command to send a message.  The bot won't fill in the player name part of the message until 10 or 15 seconds after the bot got killed (to simulate a human typing a message).  If the player that killed the bot leaves the server during this time, the bot will try to use a NULL player name (the netname) when it fills in the bot_whine message.  This can cause the game to crash.

You can modify the bot_whine.txt file to remove all the "%n" tokens from the messages or just not use the bot_whine.txt file until this bug is fixed in the next release.

This specific crashing problem should ONLY happen if you are running a dedicated server where other human players can join and leave the server.  Since bots don't leave the server during the game, a bot_whine message shouldn't attempt to get sent using a bot's name that is no longer on the server.
