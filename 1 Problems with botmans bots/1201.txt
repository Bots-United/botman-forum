I'm searchin for a GOOD FLF bot, and HPB seems the only one that can be good enough for now. But I have tested it with a lot of maps and bots often try to capture already captured points, they perform poor defense, and ehm... are you planning to improve FLF support or is good and I'm not able to let it proper work? Do you think is impossible to implement some radio commands? (a lot of CS bots have this, so if you're the master of this "bot-art"...).
Anyway thanks for your efforts.

The bots only check to see if a point has been capture at the time that they pick a goal.  If this goal (capture point) is all the way on the other side of the map, someone else might have captured that point before they reach the goal.  They won't attempt to pick another capture point until they reach the goal.  Once they get close to the capture point (within 40 units) they should see that the point has already been captured and pick a new goal.

It's way too much trouble to try to associate capture point names (the way FLF display's them to the HUD) with capture point locations (the way the HPB waypoint data is stored).  The only other alternative that I can think of is to constantly have them checking the status of capture points to see if they are heading towards a capture point that has just been captured.  I didn't think that this problem was such a big deal, but it might not be too difficult to change the behavior.  It would, however, cause more CPU load since the bots would be checking the capture point status periodically (once every few seconds) which they don't do currently.
