i dont know, if it is a problem with the bot, but evey time i install tfc the console works allright. But when i install the hpb bot its gets messed up. 
1. There is no text in the console, when i start a new server/map 
2. The console does not go down!

Is that a problem with the bot? 
im using the english halflife version , patch 1101

If you can't bring down the console, check the "game.cfg" file in your TFC directory to make sure there is an option like this...

console 1.00000

(it should not say "console 0.00000" since that will disable the console).

You may also need to start up Half-Life like so..

hl.exe -console

I have Half-Life run like this, from my F: drive.

F:\SIERRA\Half-Life\hl.exe -console -dev

Maybe this'll work for you?

hej! im not such lame :). I tried that before, and it didnt work. Maybe its something with the language.inf or something, because when the map loads i dont get any text (like mod info, server stats - nothing!)

Maybe a reinstall of Half-Life, and the latest upgrade may help.
