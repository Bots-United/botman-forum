They don't seem to have this problem on my test machines.  Did you change the "bot_grenade_time" setting the the bot.cfg file?  See the previous post about "bot_grenade_time".

I tested that but it looks like the bots dont handel a battle very god without grenades ore flashbangs.  The only thing i want to be said is that the bot uses a grenade instantly after the selkted time it is easy to avoid them just count down the time you selected when the bot sess you and woola!!
