I've been trying out 2fort, I made maxplayers 14 and the whole of each team a sniper.

The blue team snipers 0wned the red team snipers easily! The only thing was a little too easily! The red snipers didn't even get one kill! Their laser kept looking at us blue snipers but for some reason the red snipers bullets were hitting the wall to the very west of them! All I could see were bullet hole decals along the west wall, with one appearing everytime a red sniper took a shot! What in the world? ;)

You've probably noticed that when the bots reach the sniper waypoint they don't always face the correct direction (stupid bots!).  I didn't spend much time making sure that the sniper waypoints were far enough from a wall.  The bots tend to turn around when they get close to a wall so if the red sniper points are TOO close to the wall they will always face the wrong direction.  I tried to make them face forward by putting one waypoint on the opposite side of the capture point from where the sniper waypoints are.  The bots will head toward it, then turn around (hopefully facing the correct direction) then pause at the sniper waypoints waiting for someone to come out on the bridge (it just doesn't always work that way though).  I'll have to figure out some way to keep track of which angle the player is facing when setting a sniper waypoint and have the bots face the same direction (they also should look left and right a little bit while they are paused at the sniper waypoint).
