OK, am I doing something wrong, or am I just stupid?

I installed the bots, and edited bot.cfg to add 2 bots.
addbot 2 3 Soldier 1
addbot 2 2 Sniper 1


I start lan game in 2fort, and the stupid bots just stand in respawn and spin in circles and jump up and down.  

If I switch teams, and go in respawn and kick them around a little, they will sometimes run out, but usually stop somewhere else and spin some more.


And yes the 2fort.wpt file is in place.

Good thought, but I never had any old versions installed. This was my 1st install.

When you say in place, you mean it is in your tfc\maps folder?

Even without waypoints they should at least be able to stumble their way out of the respawn, eventually.

I have NO idea why they would do this.  Try another map BADLANDS or CROSSOVER2 and see if they do the same thing.

You may have to uninstall and re-install Half-Life and patches to get things to work.  I know that's a pain, but I've had to do that 3 or 4 times in the last year and a half to fix weird problems with Half-Life or MODs.
