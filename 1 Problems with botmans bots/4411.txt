I have tried now the whole day to get HPB Bots, but every time I try there are no Servers in FilePlanet which have that file. 

I am looking for the Linux Version of the HPB Bot, so the file hpb_bot_3_0.tgz.

Would anybody be so kind and mail it to me? I dont think, that I will get a FilePlanet Server with that file in the next time...

My Email-Adress ist JohnS1111@gmx.de

Thanks!!!

Thanks Botman, got it!
You care really about everything here, not a thankful job ;-), but we all love you for doing it!
