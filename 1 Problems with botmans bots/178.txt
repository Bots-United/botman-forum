   I like the new version it is a lot more fun now almost feeling real there, keep up the good work botman! BTW how do you place the new sniper waypoints and the short pause waypoints for doors?

bind a key for "waypoint menu" it will bring up a menu from there you will have your choices as to different types of waypoints that can be placed.

Read the HPB_bot_waypoint.txt file in the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder.  It'll tell you all you want to know.
