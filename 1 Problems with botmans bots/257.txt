You have to use "addbot 1 2" or "addbot 2 2" to specify the sniper class.  If you let it randomly pick a class they won't be able to join because those classes aren't allowed.

By the way, I've just fixed this problem yesterday.  The bots now know how many teams are allowed in a map, how many players are allowed per team, and which classes are valid for a specific map.

Bot will randomly pick one of the available teams, as long as there aren't already the max number of players on that team and will randomly pick from the classes that are allowed to spawn on that team.  So if only snipers are allowed, the bots will pick that.  So only civilians are allowed, the bots will pick that, etc.
