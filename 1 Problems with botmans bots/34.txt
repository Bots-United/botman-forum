Hey Robert, that little "Pissing Guy" (HTML animated gif) is getting pretty old.  

Get a new one.....please!  Everyone has seen this used by so many people on other forums and we all know were to locate all the animated gifs.  For the most part, mature, intelligent people don't need to make such a display.  Even the smiley faces are a bit annoying after a while.

Richard...I am sorry if the "Pissing Guy" offends and bores you...to some its just a way of adding a little fun to the posts. If you are too "intellectually" above what I am posting..the solution is simple..DON'T READ MY POSTS!

By the by...did you have a rough week or something?

Best Regards,
Robert

Chill out, dude.  Everybody gets tired of seeing the same thing over and over and over and over and over again.  All Richard was saying is it was getting old.  Don't take it so personnally.

Just use the [ img ] link in your signature.  See the "Help" link above for how to use the UBB style tags.
