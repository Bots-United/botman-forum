Hi

I've got a problem with Netprobe. As soon as I'm adding the server (i.e. the proxy) to the list of internet games, Netprobe in the background does the typical Windows bing sound. Halflife keeps on trying to add the server, but times out after 10 seconds. The server still appears in the list, but joining leads to another time out. When I close HL I can see that the following error message has popped up in Netprobe in the meantime: "Error sending Client data to Server: 10038".

I've repeated the setup multiple times, with both LAN and Internet Servers, multiple Mods, joining directly via console etc., but it all leads to the very same result.

At first I thought the problem would be caused by my router I have to use to connect to the internet. But seeing as how joining a LAN server makes no difference compared to an Internet server, the router shouldn't be the cause.

Error 10038 is "WSAENOTSOCK".  Here's what the MSDN documentation has to say about this socket error...
QUOTE:
WSAENOTSOCK (10038)

Socket operation on non-socket. 
An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Either the socket handle parameter did not reference a valid socket, or for select, a member of an fd_set was not valid.


This indicates that the socket wasn't created properly by NetProbe.

Make sure that you don't have ANY firewall software running on your PC (like ZoneAlarm for example).  If you have SHUT IT DOWN completely, don't just disable it, then try NetProbe again.

Make sure to follow the directions on the planethalflife.com/botman/netprobe.shtmlNetProbe webpage EXACTLY.

There is no software firewall running on my local computer, however, there is a hardware router/firewall I'm using to connect to the internet. But since trying netprobe with two computers on the LAN made no difference, the router shouldn't be the cause.

I don't know if it matters, but I've come upon another WSAENOTSOCK error while trying to join Netprobe via the console. Here's the condump:

Based on the information you've provided, here's what I am assuming...

1) You're starting up NetProbe on the machine with IP address 192.168.0.2 (since the proxy and the Half-Life client need to be on the same machine).

2) You've configured NetProbe with the Proxy Port number 27099 and set the Server IP Address and Server Port to the IP/port number of the Half-Life server you are trying to connect to (for this example let's just say it's 157.64.37.5 and 27015).

3) You've started NetProbe running (File->Start).  DON'T FORGET THIS STEP!!!

4) You start Half-Life on your machine (192.168.0.2) and connect to your own machine (you can use "Add Server" in the Internet servers list to add 192.168.0.2:27099, or manually connect to it using "connect 192.168.0.2:27099").

5) You should get connected to the Internet server going though the NetProbe proxy (i.e. your Half-Life sends packets to NetProbe who sends them on to the Internet server, who responds with packets back to NetProbe, who then sends them on to your Half-Life client).

I checked each point times and times, but it all ends up the same. Sorry I can't give you any more info about my setup etc., but I don't know what to look for.

If you're out of ideas, would you know of any other software that could do the same as Netprobe does?

There are many software tools that do this same type of thing.  They are called network sniffers.

I have used Net-XRay on several occasions (it's for purchase and I don't think they have a freeware or evaluation version) for various network troubleshooting.

Use google.com to search for "network sniffer"...

http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&q=network+sniffer

...and you'll probably find plenty of them that do the same sort of thing that NetProbe does.

Even though I didn't get any further, I'd just like to thank you for that really excellent support, thanks a lot.
