Hello,

I can't find my problem in the forum.
I compile hpb(not the metamod version) fine with sdk 2.3. I change the source for the new pfnGetGameDir return value but when I am running the steam version of the linux dedicated server I get with a correct liblist.gam the following message :

LoadLibrary failed on ./cstrike/hpb/hl_i386.so: ./cstrike/hpb/hl_i386.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Host_Error: Couldn't get DLL API from ./cstrike/hpb/hl_i386.so!
L 10/08/2003 - 12:21:19: FATAL ERROR (shutting down): Host_Error: Couldn't get DLL API from ./cstrike/hpb/hl_i386.so!

Thank's

"Couldn't get DLL API" means either the engine can't find the .so shared library, or you aren't exporting the functions with C linkage (and the functions are being exported with C++ name mangling linkage).

Was there any reason why you put the .so in it's own directory (hpb) instead of in the dlls folder where the .so files normally are?  Try moving the bot .so file to the 'dlls' folder and change the liblist.gam file 'gamedll_linux' entry to match.

Thank you Botman for your very fast answer, it's real time :-)

The functions are exporting with C linkage.
I have made a little modification of your program and I use several config files to manage the bots.
There is no reason to put the .so in it's own directory, I just wanted to be clean with all the files(.so and config) in the same directory.
I have moved the bot .so file to the 'dlls' folder and change the liblist.gam file 'gamedll_linux' and I have the same message.
When I rename the bot .so to hl_i386.so(hpb directory) it works.
It's strange because I have no problem with the linux cs 1.5 and hlds 3.1.1.0 versions, no problem with the steam windows dedicated server and cs 1.6. It's just for the new linux server.
It's not an important problem, I just spent much time on it without any solution.
