Read the ReadMe.txt file that is included with the HPB bot template source code.  That will tell you everything you need to know about adding bots to other MODs.

define DMZ_DLL, declare pSkinUsed and max_skin_index

u know C/C++ dont u!!! lol

look in bot.h on how to define your DMZ_DLL, there will be some already there for TFC, CS, etc just add a new one and make sure it isn't that same number as another "dll definition"

Parse error means you've missed out a compound, if or while statement, or a semi colon

So since it says its before a '{' you've probably got an if or while statement that has not enough brackets or more than it should have.
define p_skin_Used as a string (I take it that its a string) And your max index thingy as an integer at the top of your function :)
