Ok I run a small gaming community. Recently one of our members started running a server. He and I were talking and while he wants to keep to the same software our main game server runs he would like to run Day of Defeat part of the time. Its a linux server with halfd installed. I'm the guy doing all the work since I know most about linux and programming. Anyway, the plan is to use halfd's mod voting so this new server will run tfc all the time but allow people in the server to perform a "mod vote" and vote in DoD at which point teh server switches from tfc to DoD. 

This server supports 8 net players so we are using 4 bots (more players and it helps keep server active). From what I've read HPB_bot doesn't support DoD (PLEASE correct me if I missed something and refrain from flaming me as I've never actually played DoD myself). So my Question is which bot should I look into which will run on both tfc and DoD. Alternatively, what is necessary to run HPB_bot in tfc mode and some other bot in dod mode. Any input is appreciated. 

This server I mention doesn't even have dod installed right now. I'm just trying to get some info ahead of time. Forgive me if I ask dumb questions, as I said before i've never even played this mod.

Use botmans BotMixer5000 to run more than one bot e.g. you could run Hpb_Bot + Sturmbot maybe

You are correct about the HPB bot not working in DoD.  If memory serves me correctly, www.sturmbot.friendsofp.net/index.shtmlSturmBot was one of the first (or the first) bots to support DoD, so I would assume that it would support most of the features in DoD since it's been available for so long.  The Brain of Combat bot also works with DoD, but the botepidemic link seems to be down.  Previous releases are available boc.digitalrice.com/current.htmhere.

You should set up DoD with whatever bot you want to use, and when you switch to it, it should add the number of bots you specify.  You won't be able to mix any DoD bot with the HPB bot in DoD since the HPB bot doesn't support DoD at all.

Are you saying I won't require botmixer to use one bot for DoD and another for TFC? The plan is to use a feature in HalfD called Mod Voting. Won't I need to load modified .so files for each bot?

When you switch MODs, you will have to unload the existing MOD, and load the new MOD.  I assumed that they way halfd handled this is to restart the server with a different "-game" command line argument.  If this is the case, the dedicated server will read the liblist.gam file for that particular directory to determine which .dll or .so file to load.

If you are switching from TFC to DoD, the liblist.gam file in the DoD directory will be used, which would probably have the bot .dll or .so file in it.  The bot .dll or .so file will load the proper MOD .dll or .so file (based on what the current MOD directory is).  So when you switch to DoD, you are no longer running ANYTHING from TFC (bot code or game DLL code).

If halfd doesn't switch MODs by restarting the server with a different "-game" command line argument, then I'm would think the Half-Life engine would get confused about what the proper MOD directory is (used for loading models, sounds, sprites, etc.).  I believe you HAVE to exit the dedicated server, change the -game command line parameter, then restart the server in order for it to know where to retrieve resources from.

It would be just like you sitting at the console, typing "quit", changing the hlds_run script file, then executing it to start a different MOD.

Wow so here it is 6 months later and I just finished installing this new server to do mod voting between dod and tfc (and actually decided to go further and do cs and dmc while were at it). Am I slow or what :)

So anyway everything is working fine except on the DoD side. Sturmbot works brilliantly (love that squad formation code and such) except that after the first map runs it segfaults. There doesn't seem to be many linux users or linux support over there. Boc-Bot seems to have halted and download links are hard to find. Any suggestions on other DoD bots?
