1. When I set a jump waypoint bots do not mention it(run through). They jump only if there is an obstacle in front of them (with an extremely breaks).
2. Bots choose the nearest WP and never run to the far WP.
3. Bots don't use on-map entities like cannons in Crossfire.

Botman, would you mind fixing this problem?

1. There's no such thing as "jump waypoints" in the HPB bot.

2. Bots will only go to the "farthest" waypoint if that waypoint is a goal of some sort.  There aren't any "goals" in Half-Life deathmatch, therefore you can't create any goal waypoints for the HPB bot to head towards.  The bots will otherwise randomly follow the waypoints trying not to visit one of the 5 previous waypoints as it does so.

3. Correct.  The bots don't use the cannons on any of the Half-Life deathmatch maps (this isn't Jumbot).

You can let the bots always make a duck-jump.

Yes, but it looks funny when they don't have to jump-duck and can simply jump.  What I'll do is check if the surface is higher than the normal jumping height, but lower than the duck-jump height then the bots will duck-jump, otherwise they'll just jump the way they do now.
