Running the most recent beta (2.13) from Valve on a dedicated public server playing TFC and the most recent botman product.  We are frequently seeing ghost bots.  
By ghost, I mean a bot that drops from the game but still shows on the roster.  Sometimes the ghost is unasigned, sometimes it is on a team with no player class selected, and sometimes it reports back as a player with kills and a 0 ping.
The problem existed before installing either of the two "speed cheat fix" betas from Valve.  Is this a problem with the Valve engine, my config files, or the bot mod?

I'm not sure.  I'm not aware that anyone else has seen this problem.  I don't run a dedicated server and probably wouldn't be able to reproduce this situation without having external players connecting and disconnecting from the server.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with the bot code, the TFC mod or the Half-Life engine.  You probably don't see this problem when running a TFC server without bots because human players wouldn't connect to the server and remain unassigned to a team for very long.  If there was a problem with TFC or the Half-Life engine, human players would quickly disconnect from the server then attempt to reconnect until they got a good connection and was able to join a team.  The bots don't "know" that they aren't on a team.  They send the commands to join a team or pick a class and wait forever for the server to send the responses that they expect to receive for these commands.  If the responses never come, humans would disconnect and restart, but bots just blindly wait forever for something that may never be sent.

I suppose I could modify things so that the bots would kick themselves off of the server if the were not able to successfully join a team after 20 or 30 seconds.  The bot code would attempt to add another bot after another 5 or 10 seconds and, if everything goes right, that bot would be able to join a team and select a class.

I don't have a solution. Just wanted to let you know I have seen this problem as well. I am running a dedicated Linux server. I have had to kick these "ghosts" and use addbot again, sometimes they take, sometimes not.

I help test FoxBot and we have found that bots will join a team with no class sometimes. You can reproduce it if you incorrectly use the addbot command.
For Instance, I was adding a couple bots and forgot to specify a class and just used
addbot 1(team) <name>
i forgot to specify a class for them and they joined the game and the team specified but stayed there on the roster with no class.
Redfox mentioned it had something to do with their class defined as 0 but im not sure. Any ideas?
