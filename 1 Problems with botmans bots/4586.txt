What diferent between *.HPB_wpt waypoint file and *.HPB_wp1 ?Are these both files necessary to work HPB bots properly?

The .HPB_wpt file is the waypoint file.  This contains all the raw waypoint information (the waypoint location, what type of waypoint it is, etc.).

The .HPB_wp1, .HPB_wp2, .HPB_wp3, etc. files are the path information that gets built from the .HPB_wpt file.  The first time you start a map up, the HPB bot will read the .HPB_wpt file and generate .HPB_wp1, .HPB_wp2, etc files for the path information between the waypoints.  If you delete the .HPB_wp1, .HPB_wp2, etc files, the HPB bot will just create them again the next time you start that map.  If you don't delete these files, it won't have to rebuild them and will just use the existing files.

Cool, I always wondered that myself.

I gave up on waypoints for my bots because it seemed that whenever I had waypoint files in the maps folder, my bots would stand still in one place.  I could never figure out what I was doing wrong...

In fact the files *.hpb_wp1/2/3 are of no use, I think. You can change the source code to let the program not generate these files.

They're only "of no use" if you don't want the bots to follow waypoints (i.e. be able to navigate).

If you delete these files, they will be generated automatically the next time that map is run, and YES, the HPB bot MUST have those files in order to determine the shortest path to a goal point, but you don't need to distribute them since they will be generated from the .HPB_wpt file (and it's much smaller than the others).

However, I removed those fopen(), fwrite() and fclose() in your code there, they can also use the waypoints to e.g. capture the flag.

Because they are generated if they files dont exist or not read ??? but they will have to be regenerated each time which takes a while
