Hello, I run an 8 person server, with my two computers networked, 1 running a dedicated server and the other can be the client.  I recently added bots on, and in my bot.cfg I have
min_bots 2
max_bots 6

For some reason, the max number of bots is not 6, it goes to 8, and then I am unable to join my server.  How can I fix this?

If you set max_bots to 6 you need to remove the "addbot" commands from the bot.cfg file.  These will conflict with each other (it will probably try to add about 10-12 bots if you have max_bots set to 6 and 6 addbot commands).
