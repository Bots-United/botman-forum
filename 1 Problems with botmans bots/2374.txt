well... i dont know where to post this but i need some help/insight around this. its better to post this here on botmans forums as programmers and developers might explain better.

ok here goes:

i am trying to play with a friend with HL and its mods (CS/Ex/DMC), i start up a listen server to host and let my friend connect to my server by modem to modem connection in windows.

and he finds my server and joins... after a few mins he just timed out on my server and bringing the windows modem connection with him! after pressing a button or waiting for him (not noticing he was disconnected) i get a windows/HL error "net_sendpacket_error: no error" message and the whole HL/CS/MODs exit to the desktop.

but then we managed to get a game running by changing "rate" to 7000 and played for an hour. the next few days we tried again, we got the same error.

any thoughts about this, why would a HL error hose down my windows connection?

i think it's your connection with WON that's the problem. Your connection that's causing HL to crash.
