Sometimes fileplanet.com has problems.  Try clicking the link several times to see if you hit a different server with the Public download section.

You may have to wait a few days before things straighten themselves out.

I just tried it, seems xerla3 is down.  Which usually means the download page from old.fileplanet usually craps out.

Try again later.
