Let me first start by saying that I love the Bot.  Great concept.  There is one major issue, however, I think should be resolved in short order which is the "Crashing the server on the changelevel command" bug.  We run a voting system which utilizes that command.  Obviously, every time the level changes, the server crashes.  We would be using BotMan's bots constantly if only you could over-come that bug.  

Again, GREAT WORK, keep up the good work.  The TFC community needs and wants something like this...  ...please continue your work on this, we'd appreciate it!

Thanks, Botman.

The "changelevel" command does not work with bots.  Leon Hartwig (of Phineas Bot) at Valve is trying to correct this problem in the engine.  Until this is fixed the only way to change maps while bots are in the game is to use the "map" command (which at the moment has some problems with my HPB bot in TFC).
