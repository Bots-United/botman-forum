My HPB bot doesn't respond to ANY commands in CS.  They behave JUST like other players would on a real Internet server (except they don't tell you to shove a grenade up your ass).

Go to my "Links" section on my main web page and browse through some of the other Counter-Strike bot sites to find a bot that supports radio commands.

Since I don't play Counter-Strike, I don't work on trying to get my HPB bot to work very well in Counter-Strike.  Go to my "Links" page and download one of the other bots for Counter-Strike...
