Looks like some leftover debugging foo, but a bot.txt file is being created in my hlds directory (the one above tfc/).

It's got stuff like this in it:

before bots[index].bot_say_msg
after bots[index].bot_say_msg=Man, did you see that shot!
before bots[index].bot_say_msg
after bots[index].bot_say_msg=death just smiled on you =)  you should smile back!
before bots[index].bot_say_msg
after bots[index].bot_say_msg=ChewyBiscuits, can i have my ammo back?  i'm empty!!
before bots[index].bot_say_msg
after bots[index].bot_say_msg=Jeez [BOT]Shoggoth, I killed you without even trying!

I'm running on Linux, if that makes a difference.

Looks like I forgot to remove the Linux debug stuff when I was messing around with the bot chat modifications.  I'll remove the debug stuff and post a cleaned up version of the Linux code in a day or two.

Thanks for letting me know about this.  You can just delete the file if it gets too big.
