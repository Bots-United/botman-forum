Hi all,

Well im running HPBbot at my HL DM server, and it just run fine, but i do have some plugins e.g. kick any user if they are not moving, and sometimes my bot is not moving, and it get kicked, and thats not a great idea.

Well i think this problem will be solved if i can get my HPBbot validated in the adminmod.

I've added the HPBbot into the user.ini file with the highest status, but it dont work. 

DOES anyone know what i can do, and should do to get this to work????

Regards
Tuffy

Look in your server.cfg and see if you have this: admin_bot_protection 1. It will protect bots from receiving client commands.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd try that first.

But that won't prevent it from being kicked.  The bot protection is meant to prevent plugins from sending network messages to bots (like displaying MOTD greetings, etc.) which will cause the server to crash.

The only way to keep the bots from pausing is to increase their skill level to skill level 1.  This should keep them from pausing most of the time and you should have fewer of them being kicked.  Also try setting the "min_bots" and "max_bots" values in the HPB_bot.cfg file to cause the server to automatically add bots when they fall below a certain number (i.e. when they get kicked).

What if he set up some waypoints for the bots to follow? Wouldn't that keep them moving? 

I don't have this plugin so I wonder what delay you have it set for to kick people?

Hi Bruce and Botman,

Well i have the admin_bot_protection 1, so that dont work.

I can't use the min and Max bots settings, since i only want a bot named [Bot-1] all the time.

Botman!? Can i add something to the bot.cfg file, that gives the bot a high Level in adminmod??? Like the settings from the user.ini file as used in metamod????

As i can see from my logfile, my bot is only kicked for inactivity on the server, thats a plugin, that pervents ppl from beeing dead all the time (they get kicked after 3 mins of inactivity), so perhaps the new version of HPBbot is not respawing sometimes??? 

The Plugin is called: plugin_knight_slothound.amx

Well here is the output from the logfile, where the bot get kicked from the plugin...
----------------------
L 07/25/2002 - 09:20:02: [ADMIN] Kicked [Bot-1]
L 07/25/2002 - 09:20:02: [ADMIN] Auto kicked [Bot-1] for Inactivity.
L 07/25/2002 - 09:20:02: Kick: "[Bot-1]<31><0><>" was kicked by "Console" (message "")
L 07/25/2002 - 09:20:02: "[Bot-1]<31><BOT><31>" disconnected

Well i've now changed the plugin code, so the bot wont get kicked anymore, but i think there is a problem with the respawn function of the Bot in the new version (2.1 after i remembered). Do you know that Botman????

There are known problems in TFC with bots respawning properly after being kicked.  You have to kick the bot twice and it must join the other team in order to not wind up in observer mode (not selecting a team properly).

I never could fix this bug after trying for several hours to figure out why you have to kick them twice.

Have you tried FREE_PRIVATE() on the leaving bots, botman ? I bet that will fix your problem

In BotCreate, do
code:

FREE_PRIVATE (pEdict);
pEdict->pvPrivateData = NULL;


Just before creating your bot, and just after their edict_t comes valid.

You'll see, I'm certain 8)

Hi Botman,

Well i have changed the plugin code now, so i don't have that problem anymore, but for others or in the future, perhaps it's a great idea to make a password field in the HPB_bot.cfg, so it can be validated in the metamod (users.ini), if the server is running metamod (almost all are doing it)...
