my server used to run great with bots, now it crashes every half hour or so. i have no changed ANYTHING relating to the configuration.
Linux
AthlonXP 1700+
512MB DDR RAM

any ideas on possible conflicts between the bots and something? all i KNOW for sure is that if i run hlds booster (www.udpsoft.com) and bots at the same time, the server will never stay up longer than 10 minutes.

A normal backup/uninstall and reinstall of Half-Life usually fixes 'random' crashes.

but how would that change anything? it would result in me using the exact same configuration files. the game doesn't actually save crap into  .dll or .so files does it?

Windows is notoriously bad at keeping good system integrity.

Some applications will install DLLs in the Windows system folder without regard to other applications that may have installed more recent versions of these DLL files (thus you get an older version of a DLL that isn't compatible with an already installed application).

Also, you can have areas of the hard disk become "flaky" and occasionally give bad data when files are read.  Running scandisk will sometimes help with this problem since it will relocate data that has disk read errors.

Removing and reinstalling the application makes SURE that all of the proper files needed by that application are loaded and written to good areas of the disk (unless your whole disk is going bad in which case you still may have problems).

If reinstalling the application doesn't help, try reformatting the hard disk, reloading Windows, then reloading all of your applications.

i should have mentioned before that i'm on Linux

it keeps getting that error "SZ_getspace tried to write to an uninitializable sizebuff_t???"
it also gets this message if i run olo's fakefull

i only got that message before when i ran a server with FoxBots on Windows like 2 years ago, haven't seen it in a while ;)
