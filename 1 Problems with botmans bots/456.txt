Yes, the Stripper Add-On was updated to work with Half-Life version 1.1.0.0 or higher (it will no longer work with version 1.0.1.6 or lower).

You can find out more about it by going here...

but will the stripper addon work in standard deathmatch if you have hpb for standard dm, it was my understanding that hpb bot launched, then pointed to the mp dll, wont installing the stripper screw something up?

Yes, you can't have BOTH the Stripper Add-On and HPB bot installed for Half-Life deathmatch.  It's one or the other, not both.

You can use the Stripper Add-on with my Bot Number 10 MOD (or Phineas Bot or Jumbot).

I thought you COULD have the hpb bot + stripper addon together :


Hl.exe<---Hpb bot<---stripper addon<---Mod dll

The hpb bot would load the stripper addon, and the the stripper addon would load the mod dll.

Sounds sensible...
Its just another dll to go through.
