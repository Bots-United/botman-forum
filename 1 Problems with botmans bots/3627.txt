i notice that my bots make teams with huge gaps. i have max_bots on 8 (and it works now) so there's always 8 people of course. i joined up my server to see that 6 bots were on blue and 1 bot was on red so after i joined red it was 6 on 2. is there a way i can have bots join the team with fewer players?

They randomly select a team when they spawn.  Sometimes the teams will be balanced, sometimes all the bots will be on one team.

If you want to force the teams to be balanced, you will need to create a map specific bot .cfg file (see the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file for details on where map specific bot .cfg files should go).

In the map specific bot .cfg file, have something like this...

addbot 1
addbot 2
addbot 1
addbot 2
addbot 1
addbot 2

...to force 3 bots to spawn on team 1 and 3 bots to spawn on team 2.
