How would I set up bots such as Jumbot, or any other Bots for TFC, CS or Firearms?  I need specific and simple instructions on how to install and use these progs.  Any help would be appreciated.

Jumbot is a MOD for Half-Life.  When you install Jumbot, you will extract everything to your Half-Life folder and this will create a "jumbot" directory which will contain the Jumbot MOD.  You start Jumbot by starting Half-Life and selecting "Custom game" in the Half-Life menu.  In the Custom game, screen select the Jumbot MOD and click "Activate" to activate it.  Return to the main menu and select "Multiplayer", the "LAN game", then "Create game".  Choose a map that you want to play and click "Ok" to start the game.

For the HPB bot, you will need to run the .exe file and extract the files to your Half-Life directory.  This will create an "HPB_bot" directory inside your Half-Life directory.  Inside the "HPB_bot" directory will be a directory for each MOD the HPB bot supports (for example Half-Life\HPB_bot\tfc or Half-Life\HPB_bot\holywars, etc.).  Inside the HPB_bot\MOD folder will be a batch file called "Install.bat".  Double click on this batch file to install the HPB bot for the MOD you wish to use (you MUST run the Install.bat file in each HPB_bot\MOD directory for each MOD you wish to install the bot for).  To start the game, run Half-Life, select "Custom game" to choose the MOD you wish to play, return to the main menu, then select "Multiplayer", "LAN game", "Create game", select a map and click "Ok" to start the game.  Bots will automatically be added to the game (if you installed things correctly).

Read the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file found in the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder for more details and for instructions on how to change the bot's skill level as well as how to change the number of bots in the game.

Other bots will have different installation methods.  You should download the bot and install it according to any directions on the web site, then look for a ReadMe.txt file or any HTML documentation that is included with those bots.
