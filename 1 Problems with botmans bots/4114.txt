First - This same message is being posted both to Botmans Forums and Halfds Forums.

Ok so I followed the instructs on the FAQ to set up to run same mod (TFC) twice with halfd using the NEW method, same directory ie hlds_l/tfc/

The servers are running fine with seperate configurations ie different max players, server names, etc. All is good. I also run HPB_bots on my servers. The way it is now its using the same $MAP_HPB_bot.cfg (ie 2fort_HPB_bot.cfg) files for both servers (I use the Map specific bot config files). But I want to have a different number of bots, different names and different classes on the two servers. I'm wondering how I might go about doing this? Will Halfd utilize seperate map config files, ie 2fort27016.cfg? If so perhaps I could put my bot stuff in those files. Does HPB_bot support seperate bot config files for two servers sharing one directory?

"Does HPB_bot support seperate bot config files for two servers sharing one directory?"

No, it doesn't.  If you have a single dedicated server directory with 2 different scripts (or batch files) used to start 2 different servers, there is no way to create 2 distinct HPB bot .cfg files so that one server uses one version and the other server uses a different version.

The only solution to this problem is to create 2 different dedicated server directories and start things up from there (each one separate).

With Linux, this doesn't mean you have to have 2 copies of all the resources (sounds, sprites, models, .pak files), etc.  You can create 2 different dedicated server directories like so...

/usr/local/games/hlds_one
/usr/local/games/hlds_two

...and then have symbolic links in each of those to a directory where the resources are.  In each of them have the MOD directory (let's say 'tfc') and in the MOD directory, create a symbolic link to the real directory where the resources are...

/usr/local/games/hlds_one/tfc/models -> /usr/local/games/hlds_l/models

/usr/local/games/hlds_two/tfc/models -> /usr/local/games/hlds_l/models

...etc. (for sounds, models, even the .pak files can be symbolic links to the /usr/local/games/hlds_l/tfc/pak0.pak)
