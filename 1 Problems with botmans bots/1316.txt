Any known reason why the bots will change teams when the map changes? I have the bots configured correctly (according to the .cfg) for teams, classes, skill, & names. Sometimes even the names change. For instance: Dr. Giggles is supposed to always be a medic but has been every other class, also.
And, whenever I need to restart the game without exiting the program no bots at all will be added in any game (hl, tfc, cs, etc.).
No problems with crashing, fortunately.
Thanks.


Oh, and P.S.- Thanks, Botman, for all you've done for the community.

the best way to have the bots spawn exactly like you want them to everytime, is to use the mapname_bot.cfg files and leave your bot.cfg empty or even delete it.

The HPB bots will RANDOMLY choose a team at the start of the next map.  This is to allow for different numbers of teams on different maps.  Some maps have 2 teams, some 3 teams and some 4 teams.  If they always stayed on the team they were created on then you wouldn't have anybody on team 3 or team 4.
