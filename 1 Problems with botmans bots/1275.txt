Ive added the bot#10 sourcecode into my mod sourcecode and whenever I start a new game and addbots, the game doesnt crash, but whenever the bots start attacking eachother it does crash.

Ive added a couple new weapons to my game but I modified the bot sourcecode to be compatible with them so I dont undertsnad what might be causing this.

Any ideas?

Possibly a bad pointer somewhere.  Does it only seem to happen with specific weapons?  Can you disable all but one weapon at a time to find out which of them cause the problem?

It doesnt really seem to happen with specific weapons, and I changed it around so my bots cant use any of the new weapons I made so I dont think thats it.

I did change the glock so that you have to press it to fire again instead of holding down the mouse to continuly fire, do you think the bots may be having some trouble with that?

No, the default Bot Number 10 code doesn't hold the fire button down (except on the egon gun and charging the gauss gun), it goes "click-click-click" on the fire button anyway.

If you're using Microsoft Visual C++, you can try running it under the debugger if it's crashing with an access violation (or similar "hard" crash).  If you're not using MSVC it's going to be tough to figure out where it's crashing.

Do you get an error messages from Half-Life or Windows when it crashes?

I dont have MSVC++ so I cant check with that, and I dont get any error messages, Half-Life just freezes and I have to hit CTRL+ALT+DEL to exit Half-Life.

If Half-Life is freezing then you probably have an infinite loop somewhere.  Check for "while" loops that will never end.  It might be useful to put some code in to print something to an output file before and after the loop (during the loop wouldn't be necessary).  Just use something like this...
code:
   FILE *fp=fopen("log.txt","a");
   fprintf(fp, "Before the loop at line %d\n",__LINE__);
   fclose(fp);

   // YOUR LOOP CODE GOES HERE!!!

   fp = fopen("log.txt", "a");
   fprintf(fp, "After the loop\n");
   fclose(fp);


...Make SURE you open and close the file before each output statement otherwise the output data will never get flushed to disk and you won't see the last output statement before it locks up.
