In Rats_2001b, HLDM.

I added 16 bots. Then, the bots were all doing crazy stuff like falling off the shelves/tables/fridge/etc. I checked all paths, no path leading to suicide.

I found out that the bots try to reach their opponents at the bottom of the map. They switch to crowbar, then looks at enemy below, then falls off. I think this also causes the bots to fall into the water in 2Fort, trying to kill an enemy.

Shouldn't HPB Bot have height checks? I played the same map (but CS version, de_rats2001) with POD Bot, and they NEVER have this problem, particularly in combat. If they ever fall off, it's when after they planted the bomb they occasionally fall off the table where the toaster is (dunno why).

The HPB bot will ALWAYS run straight toward the enemy.  This causes the problem that you mention in some maps (like Rats, Turkeyburgers, etc.).

There's nothing you can do about this.  This was the simplest method that I could come up with for having the bots attack an enemy (heading straight towards them).

Er, well, I know that *I* can't do anything about it.

I was just wondering why PODBot never had the same problem.

Probably because Count Floyd added code to the PODbot to check for areas where the bot doesn't want to drop off from.  The HPB bot doesn't have this (and never will since I'm not updating that code anymore).

You're free to download the source code to the HPB bot and fix this problem yourself if you want to.

If you want to add code here's what I'm doing (POD-Bot):
Before having the bots move forward to attack an enemy the path distance is checked against the linear distance to the enemy. If it varies a lot the Bots follow their waypoints instead. In addition a height test is performed (you need to make it framebased to have it working successfully) and if it's a drop which damages the Bot it will be moved backwards instead.

Hmmm... What code? The combat code?

Sorry I can't. I don't know programming.

i've read what count floyd said on the forum bout checking the height and moving back, i don't really follow what he said. could anyone explain it to me ? i knew some programming but  nothing on AI and half-life geometry.

is there a place where i can read on stuff like these? i've read on navigational combat algorithms like CGF-AI and applied some of it on the bot, but none of them calculates vertical conditions and threats.

Unless you pre-process the map and analyze the BSP tree structure yourself, the bots can only determine world geometry by shooting out tracelines (or rays) from one point in the map (usually their origin) to some other point in the map (usually directly in front of them 200 or so units).  If the traceline collides with something, the engine will tell you this.  If the traceline doesn't collide with something, you know the way is clear.

To determine if there is a steep drop off directly in front of the bot, you can shoot a line straight down by starting 100 or so units in front of the bot (to give it time to react).  If the line hits something within a short distance, you know that it's not going over a cliff.  If the traceline goes straight down for a long distance without hitting anything, you know there is a cliff directly in front of the bot and you might want to turn to the left or to the right to avoid running off the cliff.
