After I upgrade my CS retail version to 1.4, I can not start a lan game as it always crash and back to the desktop.

Even I try to install Botmixer only with CS 1.4, it still gives the same result :(

Yes, this is a known problem.  I'm working on updating the BotMixer5000 stuff.  It should be done in another few days.
