If checks to see if there is...

1) A C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\cstrike folder
2) A file called liblist.gam in C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\cstrike

...if both of these are true it will think that Counter-Strike is installed.

If you have the retail version of Counter-Strike then it won't work.

Extract the HPB_Bot to C:\Games\Half-life or D:\Games\Half-life

The zip file will make the folders.
