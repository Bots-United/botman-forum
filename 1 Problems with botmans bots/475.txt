Does anyone know how to get HPB_bot to work on a dedicated server?  I've tried it under Windows 98SE and 2000 and tried using the fps_max command in both to lower the framerate on the server.  No matter what I do, the bots just stay in one place jumping and spinning.

Realbot and NNbot used to have this problem which I was able to fix with fps_max.  With newer versions, both now work on a dedicated server without even using the fps_max command.

I really would like to have a TFC bot to use with a dedicated server to practice with a few friends, and HPB_bot is the best one (and practically only one) and continues to get even better.  Thanks for any insight anyone can give.

I'll see what I can do about modifying things so that the bots don't think that they are stuck no matter what the frame rate is.

Cool!  I read your response to the other fps post.  I understand better now what's going on.  I think that somewhere between 50-80 fps the bots begin to move less and less.  At 90-100 they rarely move.

I still don't get why I can't get fps_max to fix the problem on a dedicated server as opposed to a non-dedicated one, but I don't know what function fps_max really has for a dedicated server either.  Good luck.  I'd like to see this bug finally squashed completely.

Yay!  The bots work perfectly on a dedicated server under both Win2K and Win98 now with no extra tweaking of the settings.  Thanks, botman!

Yay!  Now if I can just fix the other 1,001 bugs everyone will be happy.  ;)

Yeah, I hear ya.  I don't envy mod makers and such with all the complaining and whining they put up with for something they do on their OWN time and let others have for FREE.  You gotta have a thick skin and some patience.  I don't think these forums are too bad, but the CS makers get a ton of flak (not constructive criticism mind you).  I can only imagine what you guys might get through email.  It's a shame.  Hopefully, there are more grateful people like me out there than there are ungrateful to make you feel that your hard work is truly appreciated.

Now when are the bots going to build sg's and infect people already?!?!  Just kidding.  ;-)

That would be cool if you bots do start making SG's, feigning and misc...
