i dont know if this has anything to do with the bots but sometimes when im playing TFC or any other mod for that matter, it just kicks me out of the game right back to the desktop, was up wit dat?

P.S. i dont want to have to reinstall.

What patch are you running?

It would also help to know your system specs (ie. is it pentium 3, amd athlon, how much ram, disk space, etc.)
