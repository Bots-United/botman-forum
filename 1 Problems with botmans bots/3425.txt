Sounds JUST like The Eraser Bot. Their site's closed too. Fortunally I got to download it from Fileplanet. And I fixed the install problem. I had to install the files that has Windows 98 on it. And now I got my fav bot back! :)

Now the HPB_bot seems better then the eraser. :\ Probley because of my cheap graphics card. An SiS. I cannot change the gamma/brightness in the game. It ain't the bot, but Quake 2. It stays dark, and gets boring very fast.
