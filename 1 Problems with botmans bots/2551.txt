i have a problem with this great BSP Tools. I can't really explaine you the error because im german and i don't know how the error message looks in english :-).
everytime i start one of the tools (version 0.2) the program crashes with an error message. it happens with all tools, it happens only if the Half-Life path is entered correctly in the cfg files (otherwise it just tells me that the path is wrong).
it says something like "an error has occoured in kernel32.dll. bsp_view has been closed"
the version 0.1 of the tools run perfectly on my system.
im running WinME on an 750 AMD Duron

I'm not sure what the problem might be.  I don't have access to a WinME machine so I can't test it on one.

If you press "PrintScreen" when the error message occurs, you can paste that into the Windows Paintbrush program and save that as a bitmap file then e-mail me the error message (or just reply to this with the error message text, even if it's in German, AltaVista's babelfish does a pretty good job of translating German to English).

i don't think its a problem with winME. its won't run on my WinXP too. A friend of mine tested it on his win98SE PC. with the same effect. perhaps its the OS language?

There is a bug in the current release of the bsp_view application that won't handle some maps (it has to do with unused miptex textures).

Try other maps.  I know that cs_assault.bsp works on my Win98SE machine.

The miptex bug will be fixed in the next release which should be out in another week or two.
