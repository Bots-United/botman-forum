I read your readme.txt and changes.txt and your front page, you don't mention that you fixed the spies or not, but i can tell you what happens when i disguise (When i'm Blue spy):

the enemies that see me:
spy
soldier
scout
engy
pyro

the enemies that don't see me:
HWguy
sniper
medic - But for some reason 1 time the medic did..
demo

LOL!!! As far as the bots spraying logo's, that's neat!! Especially since i can have 3 different logo's with 3 different color's.. hehe, I like when i go to the sniper box and see they have decorated the box... 
You've done a Really Good Job with v1.1 !!! ;D 
I must say, the HPB seems to be the only bot that i can add like 10 bots to each team and never really encounter lag.. And especially now since there doing the logo's... Thx botman.. ;)

Just to let you know, i'm playing on a Win98 machine.. (Looking at NOTE in bot_logo_Readme.txt)..

No, the spy disguise only works for some classes.  I am using the "topcolor" setting on the player and comparing that to the "topcolor" setting of the bot.  If they are the same then the bot thinks the player is on their team and doesn't shoot at them.  I only checked this with the sniper on the other team (I assumed they were all the same topcolor value, but they aren't).

I'll have to go back and check the "topcolor" settings of the other classes and get the bots to not shoot at a spy if the spy is disguised using any valid topcolor for the bot's team.

This will get fixed in the next release.
