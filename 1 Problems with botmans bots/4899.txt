I've been into retro Half-Life lately... ;)


Well anyway, the problem is that when I use the bots and I do a changelevel in the console, the bots aren't playing on the map I changed to. They're just listed in the score table with a ping of 0. Is this a bug or something that can be fixed/worked around?

Use the 'map' command to change maps.  Don't use 'changelevel'.

Ah yes. Didn't try that. Works nice!
