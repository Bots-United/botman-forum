We have noticed an issue that may be a bug in the template or it may be foxbot specific. I've had reports of the same issues happening with other bots so I thought I would post here for botman to see and give his input.

Here is the link to the whole post.

Good find, I had never even thought to delete those.  I just went and tried it and now that i have i can play all maps again.  Quite a few of them had been crashing right as soon as the map started.  I guess it figures since i am always going back and editing waypoints.  I had assumed that when you edited waypoints it updated the wp1 and wp2 files, i guess not.  I suppose thats what i get for assuming.  So yeah, i would say to anyone that has probs, they should go and delete those pesky things.  Worked great for me.

This type of problem can occur if you are downloading waypoint files for the same map (i.e. 2fort) from different sources (i.e. one that comes with the bot and one that comes from somewhere else).  If the original waypoint file (in HPB bot case .wpt) has a date that is OLDER than the generated files (in HPB bot case .wp1, wp2, etc.) then the waypoint code doesn't realize that it needs to generate new .wp1, .wp2, files (since as far as it knows you haven't changed the .wpt file).

There is no easy way to sort this type of problem out from within the code.  It's not really a bug, it's more of an installation problem.  Perhaps it would be better for people with waypoint packs to also distribute the .wp1, .wp2 files along with the .wpt file (but this make the download MUCH bigger).  The only other alternative is to always delete .wp1, .wp2 files when you install waypoints from somewhere OTHER than the original bot download.
