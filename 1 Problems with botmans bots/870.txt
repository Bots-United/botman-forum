I waypointed a map, then tryed to check it out to see how it would work but i came to a slight problem.  When i add a bot, it will join a team but not actually go onto the map. I asked Andy in another thread but i wasn't sure if anybody was still going to that thread so now im starting another one to see if ANYONE will help me.

Erm, I did answer it!

are you adding the bot via the console, via abot.cfg or the mapname.bot file? If you can't add the bot via the console, I think you will need to backup your work and reinstall the bot. If the other two methods, make sure that the Advanced Settings on creating a server is set correctly (Add Bots From, which is set to either mapname.bot or abot.cfg).

Oops just read the other thread....I think you will need to reinstall. Do the supplied waypoint files, like 2fort, work?

It's mapname.bot - eg 2fort.bot

It seems to be working fine for me, perhaps you need to reinstall the bot again.
Well mostly working fine. This waypointing lark takes hours.
I'm on my trusty crossover2 map. Oh the joy to see a red scout cap the blue flag for the first time. Oh the agony, i cannot get the blue team to do the same. I took a diagram of my waypoint layout in the blue flag area and did it very similar for the red flag area. The bots make it to the flag but then cannot get back up the stairs (either side), so they get stuck. They make it down the same way to get to flag so they ought to be able to get back up again.
I've checked my pathwaypoints and i spent ages moving the waypoints around on the stairs.
Is it that we have to be pixel perfect with the waypoints on stairs?
Next i'm going to try to add some "careful" waypoints to see if that helps.

My .bot file is the same one as 2fort, just renamed to crossover2.bot
I checked the blue cap point and that objective flag is set correctly.

I need to see how you expert waypointers do this map, and i'll learn :)

The sentry & sniper waypoints are working really well. I got them onto the resupply bag in the basement. What about the lift? I setup the waypoints there, with a push button waypoint but not seen a bot use it yet.

How about the water route to enemy base?
I've setup the underwater waypoints but i'll have to rocket blast a bot into the water to test it :)

That's an idea. Do some "jump" waypoints at points on a map to make a bot jump up.
Also "detpak" waypoints to be used in maps like crossover2 and rock2

o ya, and what does ares mean by "The only thing you have to do is give the waypoints flags" for the waypoint converter?

im the newest newbie, yes i already know you dont have to tell me. i finally got answers to all my questions with help from Andy, some other peoples, and myself. here you go...
1.) bots will not enter your game if there is no .bot file for that map.
2.) the only way to make .bot files is to copy an already made one and rename it to your map.
3.) along with converting waypoints from .wpt to .wpf you have to make the points on each cap point Objectives.
4.) engineers try to find a way to get directly to there sentry spot, they are very stupid therefore makeing it very hard to get them to build one on the little building in crossover2.
5.) snipers do the same thing.

ps, dont make fun of me because im stupid, i just DON'T GIVE A FLYING F***

Thanks Ares for the handy converter program.

Yes anything that involves climbing ladders and they tend to get stuck at the foot and cannot be moved with concussion/grenade/rocket

I have a question when i set down sentry points does the bot build the gun facing the same way i was facing when i set the point, or is that where his back is turned. The bots sentries usually seem to be facing a wall. lol

This is great, the bots are good fun now

Ares could maybe add a rotate 180 degress flag to it or something!

The best thing to do when making sentry waypoints is to force the engineer to approach them from the correct angle. Delete pathways from all nearby waypoints until there's only one way to get to the sentry waypoint. Then the engy will have to build it facing one direction. You can find five examples of this in the crossover2 basement when you look at my waypoint files. What you can't do is build close to a ledge and make the sentry look down over the ledge.

I've had more success with ladders now. The best thing to do is:-
1)put a 'get close to' waypoint at the bottom
2)delete pathways so the bot can only approach it head on
3)put a waypoint NOT at the top of the ladder, but as far as you can ahead from the top
4) make a manual path from the bottom of waypoint to this top one. If you've done it right the pathway will go up and into the wall set behind the ladder.

I've almost finished totalwar, my best Abot waypoint file yet. The bots HAVE to climb a ladder to cap on this map, and with this method they seem to get up the ladder on the second attempt. It's a good example of this method. They bounce at the top two or three times but that's OK.

I have fixed the ladder problem. In the next relese they can climb ladder.

If we lump together the conversion program, the detailed instructions, all the waypoint files so far, and an ABot that guards chokepoints and takes random routes through the map.....

....looks like the next version's gonna set the world on fire :)

and the engineers being able to turn their guns around, make the bots know if their sg is facing the wall or a direction no one is comming from it will turn it around.

I'm now working on the defend points. I will try to make the bots turn their sentrys but I don't know if I will get it to work.

I have finished with the new visite waypoint ( visite1, visite2...) only now I need to change all the maps. If someone would like to do this for me E-mail me. You will get the waypoint files and the new version.

I'll send you that email...I think I ought to do the waypoint files, since I was the one who asked for this 'visit' improvement, and I know exactly where I'd be putting the visit waypoints on 2fort, well, casbah, crossover2 and totalwar. I should be able to get the work done over the Christmas break.

I don't think the sentry turning is as important as making bots jump to try to reach a waypoint or item slightly above step height, which will greatly improve casbah and crossover2, and stop bots getting stuck while trying to pick up an ammo bag they can't get to. Also I've got trouble with epicentre and dustbowl where bots have to pick up their own flag: the /flag/ command in a bot file makes them try to pick up the enemy flag. How about an /ownflag/ command?
