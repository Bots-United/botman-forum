Very in-genius:

1) I looked up my history for the download site for the last version of HPB_BOT

2) I knew it was a t ftp2.gamespy.com so I opened up the history folder

3) I copied the link from the last HPB_BOT download URL

4) I renamed the file to HPB_BOT_BETA_1_1.EXE!!!

WOW, You can all congratulate me now...

Yes, yes thank you... I know, I is da man, thank you, thank you!!!!

Anywayz, I have the file now, so if that site bu***rs up then I'll have to mail it some some peeps or simply stick it into my waypoint warehouse site UNTIL the site works again.

Anyway, I'm off to play it now and finish off my totalwar waypoints by adding they new sniper waypoints ;)

look out for it in da site !
