I agree with your statment on your page but if you only make bots for mods you like then why the hell do u have a Holy Wars bot ?
I tried it out cos of all the hype and OMG its rubbish.
Absoulty no fun at all.
Even Firearms (btw I tottaly h8 this mod) is better than that.
Im not saying you should make a bot for a mod you dont like , Im just saying dont make a bot becuase the mod is hyped beyond proportion

Everybody has their opinion.

I've seemed to notice that the people that LOVE Counter-Strike, Firearms, Frontline Force, and other "reality" type MODs don't care much for Half-Life deathmatch, Rocket Crowbar, Arg!, or Holy Wars (and vice versa).

I happen to like Holy Wars because it's the only MOD that I know of where you are SUPPOSED to gang up on somebody.  :)  It would be a little better with some more maps, more models, and 2 or 3 more weapons, but I suspect that those things will be coming in the next few months.

I fail to understand the overwhelming fascination with reality based MODs.  I would MUCH rather play something that I couldn't do in real life than to try to simulate something that I could do in real life.  It just don't make no sense to me.  ???
