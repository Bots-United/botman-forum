The gamespy network is getting really dodgy. A lot of the time I get the error...

Connection refused

If I try to visit the forum at a bad time...

Or I get something like "HTTP 500: Internal Server Error" or "Server Hangup" or "connection Reset by peer" Argh!

Anyone else get this prob?

It happens every once in a while.  Usually fileplanet.com has similar problems at the same time, but not always.

Ummm, I think cheesemonster is talking about the gamespy.com servers, not the gamespy game server application.

Oh well okay

I havent noticed that many problems with Gamespy servers (except for taking over 75% of the screen at counter-strike.net)
