Every bot seems to just stand in one place for 2 seconds before jumping in the air then spinning around.
Why they do this botman?
I noticed the do it on HLDM and CS too.

They jump once when they think they are stuck.  If they still don't move they turn completely around and head the other way.

There may be a bug somewhere where they are pausing and then not realizing they are paused (which they interpret as being stuck).  So they do the little jump then spin thing.

I've never seen this problem, therefore it can't be fixed.  Do you have specifics about where it happens or is it just something that happens every once in a while?  If so, its not a big enough problem to worry about since I hardly ever notice it and I probably "play" with them more than anyone else.

I had this on de_dust on cs

when bots spawned they kept getting stuck in this from BotThink
if (yaw_degrees >= pEdict->v.yaw_speed)
{
   pBot->f_move_speed = 0.0;  // don't move while turning a lot
}

fixed it with this in BotSpawnInit
pBot->pEdict->v.v_angle.y = pBot->pEdict->v.ideal_yaw;

This happens to me the whole time with the TFC bots. They just stand there and jump and spin.

Well your the only one that doesnt notice this!
They always do it!
They walk, then stop, then jump and spin on the spot for about 2 seconds or more then carry on walking.
They do it on 2Fort mostly, just underneith the sniper tower. Go watch them.
