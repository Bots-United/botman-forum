--------------------------------------------------
I am running a Win2k Advanced Server on my LAN, and thought it would be nice to have an open Half Life game with bots running 24/7. I put maxplayers 8 in the server.cfg and used the built in batch file botman included with the bot, it all worked and HLDS boots, then I get the messages "Creating bot..." 6 times (as specified in the bot.cfg) But then after the 6th bot is created the server dies. After a lot of fiddling I changed the bot.cfg to start with only 4 bots, my brother and I connected (making it 6 players) and it worked, then someone from the Internet joined (making it 7 players) and the server crashed. I have watched it crash, and you get no warning, HLDS just disppears so I'm afraid I can't really give you anything to go on.

Any help appriciated,

- Rob.

If you have Dr. Watson you can start it up and it will capture the crash dump with some information that may help.  You may just have a problem with Windows DLLs or drivers or may have to uninstall and reinstall Half-Life to correct it.

heh, well I booted up Dr Watson and then when that was running, fired up HLDS with the bots on, I put the bot.cfg to spawn 6 bots again. It booted up and seemed ok. So I got my brother to logon and try it. I watched the server as he went on, at first it seemed ok when he joined but he noticed it had him in unassigned in the scoreboard with a team color, which is rather wierd. Then he gets the all too well known "Connection Problem" message as HLDS just sticks, as if its stuck on a loop in the code or something (Happened to me :) ). Doctor watson just sat there smiling saying "No Faults" as HLDS took the whole Domain Controller down. I wouldnt mind but I was going for a personal record of 1 weeks uptime without a restart for the server :) I had 6 days on the clock. Hehe aah well these things happen but I'm not quite sure whats causing this. Just an incompatibility with my setup?

thanks,
