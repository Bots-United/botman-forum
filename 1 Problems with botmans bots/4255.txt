Subject: Setting Op4 up for specified bots, HPB_bot.cfg

I'm trying to understand this; 

addbot <model> <name> <skill> - will add a bot using the specified model, player, and skill level (where skill level is 1 to 5, 1 being the
best skilled and 5 being the worst skilled).

I have 1 bot for example;
addbot 1 botalicous 5
1 being the team(Black Mesa), and 5 being the bot skill.
When he joins, it's not by his name, but joins as "(5)".

Isn't this supposed to be addbot <model> <skill> <name> ?

And indeed it is. I put it like this;
addbot 1 5 botalicous

And he appeared as his name, but his skill is too high for a low skilled bot. How can I fix this?

The first parameter (where you have '1') should be the model you want to use (like 'scientist', 'hgrunt', 'gina', etc.)

So the command would be...

addbot scientist botalicious 5

botman

Okay! I get it now. Thanks botman! ... but, how will I tell it which team to pick?

Is the team the model? Say like for example, you use the "gordon" model and that bot will join the Black Mesa team, right?

Update: I did what you said, but I have a serious problem. It's trying to execute a "#" command and fails, saying it's an invalid server command.

I tried manually executing the HPB_bot.cfg file and comes up with the "Invalid Server Command: #" again.

I'm going to try to remove the #'s from all empty spaces in the .cfg file. It might be looking for the files but their blocked by the #'s.

I hope you know what I mean. lol. I'm looking at this;

"Any line begining with '#' in the first column is a comment line"

Theirs some blank lines in between the comments and they shouldn't be considered as comments so I'm removing the #'s so the server won't say their comments and finally add the bots. I'll report back if it does or dosen't work.

Reporting back... it didn't work. Still saying;
Invalid Server Command: #

I even tried removing all the comments and just having the settings, now it's saying;
Invalid Server Command: p

It's like this thing is reading and trying to exec the first character in the HPB_bot.cfg file.

I'm mainly trying to play op4ctf_power. Maybe it's a problem with the map... I don't know.

Ok. I'm back to square 1 again.

I restored my original, ran it, no error, then copied and pasted my settings over the original, not overwriting the comments, saved it as a copy, backed up original again, error is gone, bots are joining again, but their joining with their skill levels instead of their names again, and joining the wrong team!

Now what do I do? I did like you said, botman, and their not joining by name. Their joining by their skill level.

To make it short, their joining like this;

(1) has joined the game
(3) has joined the game
(1)(4) has joined the game

It's been a while since I've played OpFor, but I think that the team is determined by the model that is selected.  Scientist, gina and gordon will always be on the Black Mesa team.

You can't execute the HPB bot .cfg file.  It doesn't use commands that the engine will allow.  The HPB_bot.cfg file is read by the bot code when the first map is loaded and bots are spawned at that time by parsing the .cfg file.  You can't just "exec" it anytime you want to.

Post the contents of you HPB_bot.cfg file in the 'gearbox' folder.

I didn't attentianly try to exec the file, I thought it must of didn't load properly till I saw when It was loading that it already executed the file. I was just trying to get it working, and I finally did.

"I was just trying to get it working, and I finally did."

So I will assume that everything is working just fine now.  What you have in the HPB_bot.cfg file looks like it should work just fine.

Sorry but you misunderstood me. That was about the error I was getting. It's fixed now, but this other thing isn't.

Here I can have "addbot recruit 5 botalicious", and his name will show up, but he will use the default skill level.

Okay, I had to dig through the code since it's been so long since I've played OpFor.

In OpFor deathmatch mode, you use the following format...

addbot <model> <name> <skill>

...which is what I had shown above.

In OpFor teamplay mode you have to use this format...

addbot <team> <class> <name> <skill>

...where <team> is 1, 2, or 3.  Selecting '3' will auto select the team giving balanced teams.

<class> is a number representing the model you wish to use (1-7).  Don't ask me what number matches up with what player model, since I don't remember.  Try some and see what you get.

<name> and <skill> are as shown above (with name being a string of characters and skill being 1-5).

Try something like...

addbot 1 3 botdude 5
addbot 2 4 Mr.Bot 3
addbot 1 1 XXX 4
addbot 2 6 Ackthpppt 2

botman
