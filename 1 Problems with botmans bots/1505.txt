Can the HPB play OP4 with the OP4 1106 patch?
I just freshly installed OP4 then i installed the OP4 1106 patch. I was able only 1 time to actullay get into a lan game which was not HPB waypointed.. Now every time i try to get back into ANY map the stupid piece of SH*T keeps crashing.. It keep's telling me it's my client.dll .. I don't think it's HPB causeing the problem, but i'm not sure? I re-installed it a second time & tried agian .. ((CRASH)) My God.. Ok, i'm loosing my patience.. I'm going to totally remove it then try agian & if it still don't work, I give Up! :( Maybe.? Stupid Piece Of Garbage! <-- ( Opposing Force .. Not HPB )..

I figured it out.. It was <b>My</b> fault.. What i did was put the TFC commandmenu.txt into my OP4 directory and it was probably trying to read the <b>Custom commands</b> which aren't used in OP4, which was crashing me.. It all plays ok now that i removed it.. First i removed the <b>Custom commands</b> and left the menu in and found that That was my problem, cuz it didn't crash after that.. :p 

The only other thing that confused me was that it was telling me that i didn't have OP4 installed "When i was installing it" .. I guess it was trying to run the patch in the Half-Life directory but it wasn't doing it sucessfully, so after i was finished i ran it, but it didn't install my CTF maps, so then i ran the 1106 patch that i downloaded for it and it installed my CTF maps.. Yeah!!

K, A few question's though about waypointing ( I seen how you used Team specfic's & Flag goal\location's in Crash so i've no problems about those ),
1) For waypointing, do all of the current commands work in OP4? 

2) Ammo, Health, Armor, Sniper are no good when waypointing right?

1. All of the console waypoint commands will work with any MOD the HPB bot supports.

2. I haven't implemented anything in code right now that uses HEALTH, ARMOR, or AMMO waypoints (except the engineer in TFC using ARMOR to find metal) so placing a HEALTH, ARMOR, or AMMO waypoint won't cause the bots to do anything special until there is code added to take advantage of these.  SNIPER only applies to TFC which have specific classes that are snipers.  I don't count players carrying weapons that can zoom in as snipers (perhaps I will change this in a future release such that anyone carrying a weapon with zoom capabilities is treated as a sniper).

I will be adding a WEAPON waypoint to support finding weapons in Half-Life deathmatch and Holy Wars in the next release.  This will allow you to create waypoint files in HL or HW where the bots will actively seek out better weapons (and ammo) rather than just randomly following waypoints around.

The next release of the HPB bot probably won't be for several more weeks since I'm currently fighting with my telco (phone company) trying to get a newly installed DSL line working and it's not going to good so far. :(
