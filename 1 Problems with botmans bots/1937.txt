The snipers act very odd now, they go all crazy looping in tight circles.  The other changes seem to work great.  I still can't play DMC at all, and i have seen a few other people say that they have the same problem.  I wish i had dr watson so i could tell you what my error was......

If it's not crashing Dr. Watson won't help.

Which map(s) are the snipers acting weird on?  How many snipers are in the game?  How many sniper points are there (i.e. how many snipers are trying to get to the same spot)?

Okee-dokee.  Have you tried downloading DMC from fileplanet again and reinstalling it?  Maybe you got a corrupted download the fist time.

I could play Deathmatch Classic with the bots fine before 1.6.  In fact i even ran a server two weekends ago at this huge LAN party playing DMC with the HPB bot and it worked great. Whatever the problem is, it seemed to start once i changed over to 1.6.

Does the server crash as soon as a bot is added??? Cos that happens to my bot a lot hehe and here are a few things that could cause a crash as soon as a bot is added : :D

Botman, if you have got something like this in your code... (This caused a crash with me, youd probably know better anyway :-/ ) !!!


 - A NULL pointer. An example.. I was checking something between a bots enemy and itself. My iF statement actually did this and it crashed.

pBotenemy was NULL

and i did

if(pBotEnemy -> v.owner == pEdict)

That caused a crash ! hehe. Easily fixed, just do something like..

if(pBotEnemy != NULL)
{
if (pBotEnemy -> v.owner == pEdict)
//blahblah
}
Confusing but thats what caused my bot to crash earlier hehe!!!
