I'm making a Pull Style map where the Prez's have to walk through some trigger_push's and fly through the air while snipers shoot at them.  This much works okay, once I put in some of the necessary waypoints.  However, they get to the push up, and they fly way up into the air, and then I can't seen to make them continue moving forward.  I figure that it's a problem with the waypoints up in the air, but I can't figure out how to make good waypoints way up there.  Is there any easy way to make the move toward the goal, and not just manage to be shot of fall into toxic gunk?

Nope.  The waypoints MUST be within 400 units of each other to get them to consider the next waypoint as reachable.  The bots on the prez team do just about as good with no waypoints as with waypoints.  Just create waypoints for the sniper team and a few waypoints on the ground at the spawn point and few waypoints on the ground at the landing point for the prez team.

P.S. The sniper bots almost NEVER miss hitting a prez IN THE AIR.  Something that I could never be able to do.  [sm]:)][/sm]
