I am on the red team and have bots for my team and for the blue, ok.

I run my server and the blue guys shoot at me and my team, but they are NOT shooting back! Their walking right by, like they don't even SEE the enemy team!!

I have botdontshoot set to 0. What could be causing this?? BTW, this is for TFC.

Maybe it's some kind of weird map where the red team and blue team were set up as allies (hence the bots won't shoot at them in much the same way that they don't shoot at the hunted in hunted style maps).

Which map is it?

It's any map I play, like it's a problem with the HPB_bot.cfg file. I'm playing bukoofort, standard CTF map.

Like I said, I've tried everything I could think of, and nothing is working.

Here is my .cfg file,

#
# This is the HPB_bot.cfg file (for Team Fortress 1.5)
#
# Any line begining with '#' in the first column is a comment line
#
# The following commands are supported in the bot.cfg file:
#
# addbot - will add a bot using a random team, random class, and the
#      default bot skill level.
# addbot <team> - will add a bot to the specified team (1 or 2) using
#      a random class and the default bot skill level.
# addbot <team> <class> - will add a bot using the specified team,
#      the specified class number (1 - 10) and the default bot
#      skill level.
# addbot <team> <class> <name> - will add a bot using the specified team,
#      specified class, and specified player name, with the default bot
#      skill level.
# addbot <team> <class> <name> <skill> - will add a bot using the
#      specified team, specified class, specified player name, and the
#      specified bot skill level.
#
# The team number MUST be 1(Blue) or 2(Red).
# The class number MUST be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.
# The player name can be any valid player name (without spaces or quotes).
# The bot skill level can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (1 being the best skilled
#      and 5 being the worst skilled).
#
# For example, "addbot 2 5 Mojo 4" (without the quotes) adds a bot
# to team 2 (Red team), using class 5 (medic), with a player named
# "Mojo" using skill level 4.
#
# botskill <skill> - change the default botskill level (1 to 5).
#                    skill level 1 is the best, skill level 5 is the worst.
#
# observer <value> - change the observer mode setting, 1=on, 0=off.
#
# botdontshoot <value> - change the botdontshoot setting, 1=on, 0=off.
#
# pause <timeout> - pause for the specified number of seconds before
#      continuing with the commands in the bot.cfg file.
#
# min_bots <value> - configure the minimum number of bots that will run
#      on this dedicated server.
#
# max_bots <value> - configure the maximum number of bots that will run
#      on this dedicated server.
#
# bot_strafe_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bot will strafe
#      left and right while running.  Allowed values are 0 - 100.  The
#      default value is 20.  Note: a higher straffing percentage causes
#      the bots to fall off of narrow walkways and causes them problems
#      getting through doorways.
#
# bot_chat_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bot will use the
#      "say" command to send a bot_chat (checked every 30 seconds)
#      Allowed values are 0 - 100.  The default value is 10.
#
# bot_taunt_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bot will use the
#      "say" command to send a bot_taunt message after killing another
#      player.  Allowed values are 0 - 100.  The default value is 20.
#
# bot_whine_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bot will use the
#      "say" command to send a bot_whine message after being killed.
#      Allowed values are 0 - 100.  The default value is 10.
#
# bot_chat_tag_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bots will remove
#      clan tags from player names.  The default value is 80.
#
# bot_chat_drop_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bots will drop
#      characters from chat messages.  The default value is 10.
#
# bot_chat_swap_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bots will swap
#      characters in chat messages.  The default value is 10.
#
# bot_chat_lower_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bots will
#      convert chat messages to all lowercase.  The default is 50.
#
# bot_grenade_time <value> - sets the minimun number of seconds that must
#      elapse after bot has thrown a grenade before bot will throw another
#      grenade (prevents grenade spamming).  Allowed values are 0 - 60.
#      The default value is 15.  Note: setting bot_grenade_time to 0 does
#      NOT guarantee that the bots will throw one grenade right after the
#      other.  The bots will randomly decide when to throw a grenade but
#      won't throw one unless bot_grenade_time seconds has elapsed since
#      the previous grenade (i.e. you can't force the bots to grenade spam).
#
# bot_logo_percent <value> - sets the percent of time the bot will attempt
#      to spray a custom spray logo after killing an opponent.  The default
#      value is 40.
#
# bot_reaction_time <value> - sets the reaction time delay of the bots.
#      When the bots see a new enemy they will delay slightly before firing
#      to simulate a human reaction time delay.  The reaction time delay is
#      also based on the bot skill setting for that bot.  High skilled bots
#      (with skill level of 1 or 2) will have shorter reaction time delays
#      than lower skilled bots (with skill level 3, 4, or 5).  The delay
#      value can be...
#      0 - disables the bot reaction time.
#      1 - very short reaction time delay. (between 0.01 and 0.10 seconds)
#      2 - moderate reaction time delay.
#      3 - fairly long reaction time delay. (between 0.10 and 0.30 seconds)
#      The default value is 2.
#
# Any other commands in the bot.cfg file will be treated as server
# commands.  For example, you can use "map mapname" (without the quotes)
# to select a specific map, or you can use "mp_forcerespawn 1" to turn
# on force respawn, or "kick # 1" to automatically kick player number 1.
#
#
#
pause 0
#
observer 1
#
sv_gravity 90
botdontshoot 0
#
# Remove the comments on the 2 lines below to support a minimum and maximum
# number of bots running on a dedicated server. Bots will be added to the
# server until the total number of players (bots and humans) reaches the
# max_bots value. Each time a new human player joins the server, a bot will be
# kicked from the server unless there are only min_bots number of bots
# currently on the server. After human players disconnect from the server, bots
# will be automatically added back to the server until the total number
# of players reaches max_bots again. You should make max_bots be AT LEAST
# one less than the maxplayers value (otherwise no one will be able to join
# your server. 
#
min_bots 8
max_bots 15
#
bot_chat_percent 5

bot_grenade_time 99999999999999


There you go. The reason for the # marks is I'm also seeing a message that says "backup past 0" every now and then. I'm thinking it's being caused by a gap in the .cfg file, however that's not the case, but I haven't removed them. Red Team was still shooting though even with the # marks.

BTW, I removed the addbot commands from this copy of the file, for personal reasons.

I've experienced the exact same symptoms in TFC with the HPB bot code when trying to create bots at the very first frames of the server. You should try to wait a few seconds before adding bots.

I can't tell which part in the code caused the problem ; at one point I rewrote many things at once and the problem suddently disappeared. So...

I fixed it. I basically moved the settings around (also removed the # marks), and now their shooting again!

At 1st I thought it was the observer mode, since it's considered, "The ULTIMATE TFC Cheat" for this bot, allows you to walk RIGHT into the base just like a disquised enemy spy, and the enemies leave you alone. I LOVE it!

Bad part is, your teammates won't heal you or repair your armor. Your basically "on your own", sort of speak.

The "backup past 0" message is a warning from the engine.  It doesn't have anything to do with bots specifically.  It's caused when the engine tries to trace a line between 2 points in space.  If the goes beyond the edge of a surface, the engine tries to "back" the line up until it lines up with the surface (to know what got hit), the length of the trace is kept and as the line is backing up, the engine keeps track of this distance.  If the distance goes negative (past 0), it spits out that warning message.  It doesn't cause any problems, and it's not normally seen unless you have developer mode turned on (developer 1) in the console.  You can get rid of it by turning developer mode off (developer 0).

Will this also fix messages like;

"got a volicity too low on weaponbox"
"Setup_Bones: (or something, basically about when a grenade is thrown)
"got a volicity too high on 1"
and
"got a volicity too low on 0"

Will it also not show those? EXPASUALLY that "weaponbox" thing, it is VERY annoying.

Yep, those are all developer warning messages.

If you have "developer 1.0000" in your server.cfg file or have "-dev" or "-developer" on your command line when starting the server, remove those.

I had "-dev" in my command line, removed it.

Thanks for the help!
