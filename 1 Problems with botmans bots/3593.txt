Someone in this forum was saying about bots getting suck near or under a monster. I love it! When or if you update your Monster Plugin, please don't remove that bug.

That 'bug' is like a cheat code to me.;D For years since I had the bot, I got my flag stolen, and captured, SO many times. And the enemy running away laughing. But now, all I have to do is put a dang apache infront of him, BOOM! No more enemy flag carrier!;D Without even touching my mouse.

I even get 'evil urges' to blow up someone on my own team if he is getting in the lead. Just to have a good laugh.

How I HATE it when I waste ALL my ammo trying to kill the enemy, and then the enemy turns around and kills me! I just want to.... [types in monster apache evil bot name].... BOOM Baby!!!;D Just like my sig.

So whatever you do, PLEASE do not remove this bug!

???

Isn't it the goal of effective software development to reduce the number of bugs?

It depends on whether you consider a specific behaviour to be a "bug" or not.  Not attacking monsters isn't necessarily a bug (if that's the way the program is designed).

I like things fine just the way they are.  If you don't like things they way they are, you are free to download my source code, fix the "bug" and run it with your modified code.

Spawning an apache that you know will catch on someone and blow them up while they are running with the flag.. n00bism at it's best.

Using "glitches" to your advantage is called exploiting..I.E. CHEATING.  

Monster plugin wasn't created for you to cheat with, lol.  It's a fun plugin under the right circumstances, but I swear some people turn it into newbie heaven.

Just remember (and I've found this little saying of mine to never be wrong)

Cheaters have to.  There's a REASON why you're not catching these people with their flags.. try practicing instead of using exploits and maybe you'll catch them sometime..

I can stop a flag carrier, when theirs not the ENTIRE enemy team and their ALL 3 times stronger then me and I have no help from my bot team.

What are you going to do then when they kill you without even lifting a finger after you wasted all of your ammo trying to kill them?

This is my way of saying... "Eat THAT you dang 3 times stronger then me bots! And get away from my flag too!"
