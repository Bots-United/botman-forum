Ok i downloaded & installed the latest version of "Metamod v1.13 (Aug 24)".. Now i'm having trouble getting "Stripper2 - Version 1.0 (February 2nd, 2002)" to load when used with "BotMixer5000 - April 30th, 2002 (Release 5.0)".. :(

Here's how i have ALL my settings + configs:

Here's my path to Metamod - tfc\addons\metamod\ (grubber.hypermart.net/pics/metamod_path.jpgVisual)

1) My "<font color="Red">iblist.gam</font>" Loads this - gamedll "dlls\BotMixer5000.dll"
2) <font color="Red">BotMixer5000.cfg</font> loads like this:
dlls\tfc_botmixer.dll
hpb dlls\HPB_bot.dll
//fox ..\FoxBot\FoxBot.dll
//odd dlls\ODD_Bot.dll
//abot dlls\ABot.dll
//team ..\teambot\TEAMbot.dll
<font color="Red">meta addons\metamod\metamod.dll</font> - Placement dosen't matter.

3) My "<font color="Red">Plugins.ini</font>" (Found now in tfc\addons\metamod\):
win32 ../foxbot/foxbot.dll - (Loads)
win32 dlls/monster_mm.dll - (Loads)
win32 dlls/stripper2_mm.dll - (Loads but then 2fort_str.cfg gets AXED Totally)

But what happens is Everything loads, but my stripper2 file gets AXED.. My Monster files have no problems. I've only checked this out on 2fort so far .. I do of course have current files that spawn Monsters/Stripper2 stuff for 2fort.

And when it's "Go Time"!! You can see clearly what happens by viewing my - grubber.hypermart.net/Stripper2_Files/with%20botmixer/Log files

That sub directory is what happens when i don't use BotMixer5000 & load normally with Metamod, of course everything is OK!
I've tried useing some of the Metamod commands:
All console command functionality is provide by a single command "meta", with multiple sub-commands: 


   usage: meta <command> [<arguments>]
   valid commands are:
      version                - display metamod version info
      list                   - list plugins currently loaded
      cmds                   - list console cmds registered by plugins
      cvars                  - list cvars registered by plugins
      refresh                - load/unload any new/deleted/updated plugins
      load <name>            - find and load a plugin with the given name
      unload <plugin>        - unload a loaded plugin
      reload <plugin>        - unload a plugin and load it again
      info <plugin>          - show all information about a plugin
      pause <plugin>         - pause a loaded, running plugin
      unpause <plugin>       - unpause a previously paused plugin
      retry <plugin>         - retry a plugin that previously failed its action
      clear <plugin>         - clear a failed plugin from the list
      force_unload <plugin>  - forcibly unload a loaded plugin

where <plugin> can be either the plugin index number, or a non-ambiguous prefix string matching description or file.

But no success there..
So i guess it comes down to loading Metamod normally & not going through BotMixer5000 if i want to use Stripper2 .. hehe..
But i figured i'd post this & see if maybe you could think of a solution that could get Stripper2 working with it's scripts when executed this way.. :) Or anybody for that matter.

Are you sure BotMixer can load metamod dll properly? 

Try making liblist.gam load metamod DLL to be sure. Also put Foxbot in the botmixer config file.

For the mm_gamedll make that the botmixer DLL that usually goe in as the gamedll in liblist.gam when its installed.

Have all the plugins in metamod.ini

I think the layout should be somthing like...
code:


              STRIPPER 2                     FAKEDLL 
METAMOD ---                --- BOTMIXER ---  HPB_BOT  -- MOD DLL
            MONSTER PLUGIN                   FOX_BOT 




I dont know if its right!

LOL!
I wonder why i was even trying to do it that way?
Sheeesh, i even downloaded Metamods Installation page the same day i downloaded metamod.dll.. I read it a couple times or more. I even read the part that said about what you said
QUOTE:
For the mm_gamedll make that the botmixer DLL

 But why i never tried that before posting here is uhhh, well, i dunno? ;D

So yea, i load metamod through "liblist.gam" & i put this in my command line "<font color="Red">+localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/botmixer5000.dll</font> -dev +sv_lan 1 +maxplayers 17 +connect +map %CLIPBOARD% -noipx -nomaster +log on".. Works No Problems now! 

Oh the reason i have the FoxBot.dll in my plugins.ini is cuz it's a metamod plugin & can be used that way. :)

Thanks Cheesy...
