min_bots -1
max_bots 12

there are 16 people on the server, 4 of those people are bots. why haven't they left? it's been like this for 20 minutes. the bots never seem to fully leave on their own, there's always 3 or 4 still on when the server is at 16 people

min_bots should not be -1.  Use 0 if you don't want to specify a minimum number of bots.

um ok thanks but the DEFAULT config is -1 but commented out, you should probably change that :)

it looks like this:
#min_bots -1

I have a question. 

How can you get the bot to actually leave the server and let another bot join, even though theirs only 1 human player, which is me.

You can use "kick" to manually kick a bot from the server.  About 30 seconds later, another bot should be added (as long as the number of bots + players is less than max_bots).

Is there a way that I could just add a bot with a name and the game would pick the team, class and all of that other stuff?

Say for example: addbot Kickin_ASCII

It would be nice that I wouldn't have to get the bot to pick a team, and that the game would pick it for the bot.

Nope :( Not with the HPB_Bot I don't think, it would be cool to edit what you want the parameter order to be with Addbot :P Should work okay with my bot though hehe that's why I changed it too because I'd rather add bots with my own name without assigning them a skill/team etc myself.

You would have to look at the source code and see what it says about adding bots. That means knowing C++ and having an IQ of over 150. And both I'm no good at.

I like to be able to know how to get the bots to say revenge sayings like I have asked botman before. If a bot is losing, but has killed you, then it should say something like "Ha! Got you back, %n!". Understand what I'm saying?

Damn, I thought I was passably stupid... Would I really have an IQ over 150 ?
;D

Programming is simple & fun. Anyone telling the contrary hasn't ever tried.

Well still. I probley wouldn't even know what to look for. You got to KNOW what your doing before you do it.

Just like trying to learn Flash 5.
