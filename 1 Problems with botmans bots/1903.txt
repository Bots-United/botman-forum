The snipers seem to sometimes face the wrong way now.  Not all of the time, but it did happen quite a bit.  Also the medic on the other team would not attack me.  He just kind of chased me, but he never shot and he never whipped out the medic pack. Has anyone else seen any of this?  I am talking about ver 1.6 by the way.

I've had the same trouble with the medic and with the snipers *slighty off i guess* just sometimes, maybe If i see it again. The medics usually dont attack at all with me, they just heal team-mates.

I was using the latest admin mod (i think...) with it at the time

I'll look into the medic not attacking players on the other team problem.

What I changed for the snipers shouldn't have effected where they are aiming while camping, but I'll look at that also.

 Yup. Medics only heal you & your teamates, they don't shoot or throw grenades.
I seen what your talking about with the sniper when i was playing "crossover2", he had been blown from his spot and was going back when he got back he faced the wrong direction, but after a few seconds he adjusted himself and faced the correct way.

Another problem i also noticed that nobody mentioned is with the engineer's. And that is that if you build an sg on one of the platforms by the bridge in "crossover2" the engineer on your team will try to upgrade it even if it is already at 100%.. Now really i guess it's not much of a problem as i could put a jump waypoint in so that the engineer could get up & whack it a couple times BUT there's still going to MAYBE be an inconvience, because when i was playing "casbah" there was the problem with the engy & i don't understand why he didn't just go around? ( I checked date/timestamp it's casbah.wpt that ships with the HPB). :D
Here's a screenshot so you can see what i mean (He would not leave this spot! And yet, He would not go around either.)
grubber.hypermart.net/pics/casbah0000.JPGcasbah engy 45k

And i also noticed another problem with the engineer's & i guess it has something to do with the dispenser. For some reason the have their spanner out & (I guess because i have not personally seen them) but i guess they go to put armor in their dispenser but get stuck.. Here's a screenshot of it from 2fort: grubber.hypermart.net/pics/2fort0002.JPGDispenser engy 25k
I'm positive they stay their as i stood and whatched them "Even tried blowing them away but they go right back & just stand their".

That's about the most that i've seen in the wake of any problems.. Even though meds don't shoot or grenade, mine seem to make up for it by cappin alot.. LOL! And the chat system JAMS! Cool update botman! But just remember this, grubber.hypermart.net/pics/8391.jpgClick Here ;D

---Modified---
Medics Work if "bot_reaction_time 0" .. So if it's set to zero they will shoot & infect. Not sure if set to 3 ?
About "casbah" engineer's, i went in and looked to see if maybe there was a pathway that lead from the waypoint to the sg thinking maybe that was why he was getting stuck and found that NO pathway connected it. But i see that the engineer is VERY persistant on wanting to whack an sg from any distance. Here's another screenshot from "casbah". And it was not even this engineer's sg, but another engineer's on the team. grubber.hypermart.net/pics/casbah1.JPGcasbah engy behind wall 27k
He was totally stuck, he didn't even try and jump or anything, probably would have been there till any enemy came around. I had strafe set to zero, maybe if it's set to atleast 10 that would help him out.? Hmmm, my screenshots look a little dark, i should probably turn brightness up. Sorry bout that.

Just thinkin, maybe the dispenser problem i'm seeing is because of the "bot_reaction_time" ? Well i'm sure you'll figure it out botman.. :->

Yup, the changes I made for the medic healing stuff defintely screwed up the medic attacking enemies (healing teammates is actually attacking someone one your team with the medikit, that's why things got messed up).

The engineers in your screen shots are trying to get to the sentry gun to upgrade it.  They see it.  They WANT to get to it, but they are too dumb to figure out how to get there.  I'll either have to modify things to get them to use waypoints or just make them give up after 2 or 3 seconds if they haven't reached the sentry gun that they see (and forget about getting to one for 10 or 15 seconds otherwise they'll keep trying to get to the same one).

Also, currently I don't have them checking the health of the sentry gun to see if it's 10% or 100%, they just whack one whenever they see one.  If the "health" field of the sentry gun entity actually contains the correct health then I can have them check it before trying to upgrade one that doesn't need it.  I'm not sure how to check how much ammo it's got (if I remember correctly you don't see this when you target the sentry gun, but the engy that built it gets a percentage displayed at the bottom of the HUD).

The snipers keep adjusting their aim every 3 to 5 seconds (random).  So they might face the wrong way for a few seconds but they should eventually turn and face the right way (within 5 seconds).  I may shorten this time delay a little bit, but when I had it at 1 or 2 seconds they kept fidgetting around and it looked like they were hyperactive or something.

I'll work on fixing the medic thing and mess around with the engineer code some this Wednesday (4th of July here in the States).  Whoo-Hooo!, shoot off some fireworks and drink some beer, what a combination huh? (don't forget to THROW it after you light it!) ;D

Maybe the snipers could adjust their aim now and again to see if there are any enemies behind them. Particulary I never like the idea of things happening after or for a specific time, I would rather like the idea of things happening after something else happens. If u get the idea.

For example (I remember reading this in a bot update, cant remember what bot it was, a CS one i think)

It said...

When the players uses the radio command "go go go" the bots will act agressivly for 15 seconds.

--

I didn't think that was a particulary good idea, what if an enemy struck them after the 15 seconds when theyre defense was down, hehe.

I woul make it so that the bots would act agressively UNTIL they see no danger. Which has a bit more differences in time and what the bot does.

--

I may not mean anything in this case hehe, but I though I might bring it up, since we are trying to get bots to become more human ;)
