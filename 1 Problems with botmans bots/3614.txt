I downloaded Botmixer 5000, hoping to run PODbot, Realbot and HPB Bot at the same time, on the Counter-Strike Map cs_assault. The bots work brilliantly singly...but whenever I try to run them together using Botmixer I get an error. After "Create Server", and setting up a game, I click OK...I have the console enabled so I see some text while it loads. It says Host_error: SuckOutClassname: parse error or something like that...I've made sure Botmixer and the other bots have been installed correctly and in the correct order, but with no results. Please help :)

You have installed things in the wrong order (the order is important).

The BotMixer5000 MUST be installed LAST and it MUST be removed FIRST anytime you are installing or uninstalling bots.

Remove the cstrike directory, and re-install Counter-Strike.

Install the PODbot, then install the REALbot, then install the HPB bot.  Finally, last of all, install the BotMixer5000.  Then configure the .cfg files according to the BotMixer5000 ReadMe.txt file.

If you decide to remove REALbot or PODbot, or the HPB bot, you MUST remove BotMixer5000 FIRST (by using the Remove.bat file), then remove the bot you want, then, if you want to use BotMixer5000 again, reinstall BotMixer5000 (by using the Install.bat file).

After removing and reinstalling everying in the correct order, I can now get the different bots to work (Yey!), but...the bot menus for Pod and Realbot dont work. PODbot uses =, Realbot uses h...but pressing them in the game has no effect. On the console it says Unknown Command: podbotmenu, or botmenu. I think it's something to do with the bit at the beginning where you have to type "pod addbot...real addbot...", so it would have to say "pod podbotmenu"?

Update:

I've changed the PODbot.cfg file so that it says bind "=" "pod podbotmenu" (or something like that) and now the podbotmenu sort of works in the game while running it with Realbot and BotMixer5000, but after the first screen where you get the options to add/remove bots etc, you push the corresponding key and the menu just closes, with no effect.
Not even the menu will come up with Realbot, after doing the same thing in the Realbot bot.cfg file, changing it to say  bind "h" "real botmenu" from bind "h" "botmenu". On the console in the game it only said Unknown Command: botmenu.

Please could someone tell me how to sort this out, so that I can have the PODbot and Realbot bot menus work when I press the "=" key for PODbot and the "h" key for Realbot. Thank you :)

(NOTE: Both bots actually work in the game, but the menus dont)

The menus (and any other bind commands in the bot .cfg files) aren't going to work.

This is because of the redirection that BotMixer5000 does to get multiple bots to load.  Any commands that you wish to send to the bot DLL files will need to be preceeded with the "name" you assigned in the BotMixer5000 .cfg file (i.e. instead of "addbot" it's "pod addbot", etc.).

You may want to create a separate .cfg file with all the new BotMixer5000 commands you want to use and exec those after loading the map (i.e. exec botmixer_cmds.cfg).

So I can get the bots working fine by using the real rb_addbot, pod addbot etc, but it's not possible to get the menus to work unless I create a .cfg file called exec botmixer_cmds.cfg? Please could you explain this in a bit more detail, or e-mail me something like it, please? Thank you for your reply :)

I'm not even sure that the bot menus will work because the menus have hard coded commands in them that they assume will directly execute commands in the bot code.

Menu commands are typically activated by sending "menuselect 1", "menuselect 2", "menuselect 3", etc.

In order to get these to work properly you would have to bind the "1" key to "pod menuselect 1", "pod menuselect 2", OR "real menuselect 1", "real menuselect 2", etc.  You won't be able to flip flop back and forth between menus for different bots.  You MIGHT be able to get the menu commands to work for one bot but not for the others.  I would suggest you just learn what the commands are that are sent by the menus and use those instead.  (i.e. instead of selecting the menu command to kill all bots it might be something like "pod killall", etc.).  See the documentation for each bot to know what commands it will accept.
