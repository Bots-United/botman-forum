Im sorry if im missing something here..  I went with your bots over the others because of your working with 3.1.1.1  I am running a dedicated server under linux.  Version 3.1.1.1 of counterstrike with the newest adminmod and metamod.  Now.  I followed your dir's to install.  Since i am runing adminmod i put my liblist.gam back to start metamod.  I then use the command line to start the game using this.

screen -A -m -d -S hlds ./hlds_run -game cstrike +maxplayers 20 +map de_dust +localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_bot.i486.so

I get the seg fault error seen below.

./hlds_run: line 83:  2842 Segmentation fault      $HL $*
Add "-debug" to the ./hlds_run command line to generate a debug.log to help with solving this problem

I reread the forums adn say the code change. I do have the 3.0 ver of your bots so I shouldnt have to make that change. And I do have the newest ver of metamod 1.16 so that shouldnt be a prob. Is there something I am missing?

Thanks much.

Are you SURE you have the .so file in the Counter-Strike MOD folder (i.e. cstrike/dlls/HPB_bot_i486.so)?

Also, make sure you're using "HPB_bot_i486.so" and not "HPB_bot.i486.so"  (I assume the extra '.' was just a typo).

Did you run the Install script to install the HPB bot after extracting everything from the compressed tar file?

OMFG. Man i'm sorry for bothering you with this. I never even noticed that . instead of the _.. I had copy/pasted that line from the forums and never even noticed. It works perfectly now. 

Lesson to be learned. Always check the stupid after spending all day on the complicated one. 

Peace
