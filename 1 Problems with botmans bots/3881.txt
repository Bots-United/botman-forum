Linux dedicated server running TFC:

Ok, I downloaded the crossover2 waypoint file from Waypoint Warehouse in Binary mode. I unziped the file which produced crossover2.wpt I put the file in the $mod/maps folder. When I load HL the log shows:

L 11/30/2002 - 14:33:30: Server cvar "cr_random" = "0"
L 11/30/2002 - 14:33:30: Server cvar "mp_chattime" = "10"
L 11/30/2002 - 14:33:30: Server cvars end
loading waypoint file: tfc/maps/crossover2.HPB_wpt
PackFile: /usr/local/hl3108/gm1/hlds_l/valve/pak0.pak : sprites/lgtning.spr
PackFile: /usr/local/hl3108/gm1/hlds_l/tfc/pak0.pak : sound/sentences.txt


It doesn't even see crossover2.wpt and when I rename it to crossover2.HPB_wpt and re-start the server I get the same message and the bots act stupid not even knowing how to get out of respawn and running into walls and such. Is there another config, or am I doing something wrong??

Thx

If it can't find the waypoint file, you will see...

Waypoint file <mapname> does not exist!

...in the log file (where <mapname> is the name of the current map).

If you don't see the "does not exist" message, then the waypoint file was loaded.  This doesn't necessarily mean the waypoint file is actually any good.  Many people create waypoint files that don't actually work properly.  The only way to know for yourself that a waypoint file is working the way you want is to create it yourself.  See the HPB_bot_waypoint.txt file for instructions on creating a waypoint file on the client (running a listen server with no bots).
