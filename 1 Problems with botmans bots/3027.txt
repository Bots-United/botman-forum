If you are running the latest Half-Life 1.1.0.9, other problems have been reported with BotMixer5000 and the latest Half-Life.

I will look at these sometime this weekend to see if I can correct the problems.  Wait until after this weekend to see if things were corrected.

And if you want to play with metamod support so that you can include the Stripper2 & Monster plugins i did a page on how to setup your config files: grubber.hypermart.net/BotMixer5000/BotMixer_Metamod/tfc.htmHERE
