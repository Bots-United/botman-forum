Yes, I've had to turn off lots of the HUD effect (like capture point targeting and teammate triangles) to keep it from crashing especially when you are frozen at the attacker's spawn points.  I found out that if I just stand still and don't move during that time it hardly ever crashes, but if I spin in place, WHAM!, it crashes most of the time.

 LOL!! Jeeezzz.... You sound like a lil kid who plays & goofs with things cuz they can't wait for the round to start. Maybe Deadly is doing the same thing.. Me, i just flicker the flash light at the bots, "sending them morse code" ... Never crashed on me except in "i think flf's first couple of versions"...

No but in all seriousness the worst i experience is when i first start a game & finally meet up with the enemy or the fighting begins "I lag Bad! So bad my whole screen freezes up for a second then resumes", after that it plays no problems.. I start showing the bots who's MVP! :o hahahahehehe... 8)
