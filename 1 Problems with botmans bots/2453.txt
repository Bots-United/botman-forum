hey again botman,
i used your bot10 sourcecode for my mod and it compiled and everything went fine, but when i put some bots in the server it crashes. Do you know how to fix this?

Did you modify the source code?  If so, go back to the unmodified code and build everything again.  If you didn't modify the code then try doing a "Rebuild All" to build the DLL again (it should work right out of the box).
