So the members of my community [STF] want to have a match with another group and for this we don't want any bots around. Right now I have bots on all maps by using map bots configs ie 2fort_bot.cfg. I was thinking if I stick the default bot.cfg file back into the tfc folder that I could quickly accomplish the needs for this match without disturbing my map specific configs. Is this true? This match is tomorrow night at 8pm PST so hopefully you can reply by then. 

Thanks,

Brian

No, the map specific bot.cfg files will override the default bot.cfg file.  You will need to rename or move the map specific bot.cfg files so that they won't get used (and delete or rename the bot.cfg file so it won't get used).

If you are on a Windows machine, you can open an MS-DOS window and change to the tfc/maps folder then use...

rename *.cfg *.xxx

...to rename the map specific bot.cfg files.

If you are on a Linux machine you can create a "cfg_save" directory inside the tfc directory and move stuff there like so...

cd hlds_l/tfc
mkdir cfg_save
mv maps/*.cfg cfg_save

Then just start the game up like normal.  When you are done, rename the files back or move them back to the maps directory.

ewwwwwww windows..... :)

Thanks. There's only 3 maps they want to play so I'll just rename those 3 files to map_bot.cfg.old that should do the trick eh?

Yep, that should work too.
