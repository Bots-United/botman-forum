Every now and then someone will join my listenserver and start issuing HPB_BOT related commands screwing everything up. Does anyone know how to prevent this? Besides running a dedicated server! Right now it isnt that bad but I know in the future it will get worse. Botman is there anyway you can fix this? Maybe make it so you have to log on with a password or something to issue commands.

It can only  be fixed if :


Botman changes these commands to rcon commands

Someone makes a good bot which uses rcon commands
OR

Make a dll that sits ontop(or on the bottom) of the hpb bot(yes, it can be done in a way possibly) and make it intercept the commands etc...

Why don't you just run a dedicated server and a client on the same machine?  That's the simplest way.  I'll see if there is an easy way of telling which cleint is running on the same machine as the server and only allow bot commands for listenservers if the commands come from the server's client.

Ive tried that before Botman but the lag seems worse when I do...I thought I had the horsepower but I guess not :(

Do you have to be on the internet, when you do this?

If you don't, then start the server, offline. That way pepole won't get in and mess things up.

I think the whole point was to create a server on the Internet with bots, but to not let other players issue bot commands.

I'll see what I can do.

Why don't you have some sortof password login system for the bot in order to use the commands?

Because that would make it a pain in the ass for most people who only use the bots for themselves and don't provide a listenserver on the Internet.

Yeah but its a bigger pain when some jackass goes around screwing up peoples listenservers(they are out there Botman...I see quite a few just for tfc!) I like pika's idea.

How does everyone feel about adding a password????

Why not just restrict bot commands to the client that is on the same machine as the listenserver.  That's much more use friendly.
