Ok after extensive reading, I can't seem to get things to talk correctly. I've got a linux TFC dedicated server with adminmod, halfd, metamod, and HPB bot...all the latest versions. I've read docs until I'm blue in the face. Either Adminmod, metamod and halfd work or the bots work but not both. I also tried creating the metagame.ini but get:

[META] ERROR: File 'metagame.ini' is no longer supported.

My liblist.gam file looks like:

// Team Fortress Classes Game .dll Listing File
// Load order is determined by file order.
game "Team Fortress"
url_info "www.teamfortressclassic.com"
url_dl ""
version "1.5"
size "37000000"
svonly "0"
cldll "0"
type "multiplayer_only"
nomodels "1"  // Don't show models in browser, since you don't pick them there anyway.
mpentity "info_tfdetect"
gamedll "dlls\tfc.dll"
// gamedll_linux "dlls/HPB_bot_i486.so"
gamedll_linux "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod_i386.so"

If I switch around the commented lines obviously the BOTS work but metamod doesn't load. How do I get them both loaded??


Does ANYONE have ANY IDEAS AT ALL???? I'm really getting frustrated and desperate to get these all working together. I keep going round and round with the different forums (admin mod, metamod, halfd, etc..) ANY HELP would be GREATLY appreciated!!!

Thx

You need to use the metamod "localinfo" argument on the command line when starting the dedicated server.  See this thread for an example (also see the metamod documentation)...

AAh ok so then for a linux server would it be:

+localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_bot_i486.so

or 

+localinfo mm_gamedll_linux dlls/HPB_bot_i486.so??

Kind of confused since it doesn't make any reference to dedicated linux servers.

Thanks for your help!!
