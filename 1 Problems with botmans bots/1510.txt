Hey guys, I run a 20 man server have the max and minimum set to 19 and 0, but I always have to addbots, how can I get them to appear on there own? without typing addbot 10 times?

If you don't have map specific bot.cfg files (i.e. 2fort_bot.cfg, badlands_bot.cfg, etc.) and have "max_bots 19" and "min_bots 0" in the bot.cfg file then you should wind up with 19 bots on the server within a minute after the map finishes loading.  Make sure you don't have any "addbot" commands in the bot.cfg file since these will conflict with the "max_bots" setting.  It will take about 20 or 30 seconds before it starts adding bots after the map change so don't expect all 19 of them to show up in 5 or 10 seconds.  Just be patient and wait and see if they eventually get added.  This was done to allow real human players a chance to get connected on dedicated servers when map changes occur.  The bots don't really care if they can't join the game for 20 or 30 seconds.

Other than the above, I don't know of any reason that setting max_bots to 19 wouldn't give you 19 bots on the server.

well, they still wont auto-add, i ###'d out the addbot parameters at the bottom for the 3 default ones. Also even when i addbot to 20 I cant join my server because it is full...? I'm confused

If assume you are using "+maxplayers 20" on the command line when starting hlds_run.  If you manually add 20 bots you won't be able to join because all the player slots will be used up.  Here's what I have in my command line for starting up a 20 player server on tfc...

./hlds_run -dev -game tfc +maxplayers 20 +map 2fort -nomaster +sv_lan 1

...I'm running a LAN server so I have the "-nomaster and +sv_lan 1", which you won't need if you are running an Internet server.  Here's what my bot.cfg file looks like in the tfc directory...
code:
# This is the bot.cfg file (for Team Fortress 1.5)

# wait for 3 seconds
pause 3

# change default bot skill level to 2
botskill 2

# Remove the comments on the 2 lines below to support a minimum and maximum
# number of bots running on a dedicated server.  Bots will be added to the
# server until the total number of players (bots and humans) reaches the
# max_bots value.  Each time a new player joins the server, a bot will be
# kicked from the server unless there are only min_bots number of bots
# currently on the server.  After players disconnect from the server, bots
# will be automatically added back to the server until the total number
# of players reaches max_bots again.  You should make max_bots be AT LEAST
# one less than the maxplayers value (otherwise no one will be able to join
# your server).

min_bots 0
max_bots 19 

bot_whine_percent 50
bot_strafe_percent 20
bot_grenade_time 10

...when I start the server the map loads and about 30 or 40 seconds later it starts adding bots.  About 60 seconds after the map loads there are 19 bots showing up when I run the "status" command.

Try the command line shown above without the "-nomaster +sv_lan 1" and use the bot.cfg file shown above and see if you still have the same problem.
