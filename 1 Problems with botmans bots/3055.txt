QUOTE:
The install batch files now copy the HPB_bot_logo.cfg file into the MOD directory so even if you don't have custom bot logos set up, they will pick from a list out of the standard decals.wad file.

 Ummm, no it won't.. Why you might ask..
Here's what you put in the install.bat files:
echo copying <font color="Red">HPB_bot_logo.txt</font> to dmc\<font color="Red">HPB_bot_logo.txt</font>
copy ..\<font color="Red">HPB_bot_logo.txt</font> ..\..\dmc\<font color="Red">HPB_bot_logo.txt</font>

OOPS .. :o
code:
HPB_bot_logo.cfg
 :D

Would you believe that I actually went back after changing all of the Install.bat and Remove.bat files to make sure that I had changed then all correctly.

Somehow I managed to miss the DMC ones.  The command was cut-and-pasted from the 2 lines above it for the bot chat text file.  Oh well, 1 out of 7 isn't too bad!  ;D

Correction, every single Install.bat file is messed up.

I've actually got 2 HPB_bot folders in my Half-Life directory.  The one I use to build the release .exe file from and the one I use to test with (which contains modified .cfg files).  I edited the Install.bat and Remove.bat files in my HPB_bot_test folders and forgot to copy them to the real HPB_bot folders before building the self-extracting zip file.

I guess I'll make a 2.1a release with the modified Install.bat and Remove.bat files.

LOL B-Man... I shoulda told ya that they were all wrong but i thought maybe you would have caught that more quickly.. My fault.. I guess it's that ESP thing, that people can read my mind. hehe..
Yu do suprise me though, i thought maybe you'd just post it on your news page instead of a 2.1a release.. But you know best! :)
