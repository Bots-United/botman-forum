Its true! I started playing against the bot and I was taking hordes of them down at a time.....AS A SCOUT! I never experienced this bug before, untill today. I was playing on Avanti with my custom waypoints, and I was killing all the bots in one shot with my nailgun! I managed to rack up 754 kills in an hour. 

This is obviously a bug either in TFC or in the HPB bot, because its impossible to take down anyone that fast.

What do you think was wrong?

maybe they were hurt earlier by other bots on your team, or maybe their own.

there are variables "tfc_balance_scores" and "tfc_balance_teams" which give the losing team or individual a handicap

How about tfc_no_die? That way you won't get killed by those bots, and grenades fired by those demomen. And rockets fired by Soldiers.

WHY can't their be a GOD cheat in TF? :)
