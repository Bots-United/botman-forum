I've got a problem. Sometime when im playing Half-Life with bots i cant see crosshair! It is too small, its colour is the same as the background. Can do something with that?

There are some custom crosshair downloads that are available for various MODs.  Try searching on www.google.com for "Half-Life crosshair download" or something similar.
