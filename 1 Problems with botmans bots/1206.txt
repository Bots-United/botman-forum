So what's the trick with ladders? Is there a tutorial somewhere I'm missing? I have the ladder in stalkyard working 50% of the time which is annoying. Why doesn't it work every time? The bot climbs to the top then falls back down instead of getting off and moving to a nearby waypoint.

I tried putting a waypoint at the top of the ladder and linking it to the one below it. I found this caused the bot to fail to make the climb almost every time. I tried putting an additional waypoint near the top waypoint to give the bot something to move toward after getting to the top. Doesn't help.

I've found the only way to make it work even marginally is to remove the top waypoint completely. I got this idea from looking at someone elses wpf file for stalkyard.

Is this the best I can achieve here?

If you have waypoints in a map you should place a waypoint at the bottom of the ladder (just a little bit off of the ground) and a waypoint at the top of the ladder (just about as high on the ladder as you can get without falling off of it).  You should also make sure you have enough waypoints between the top and the bottom.  For short ladders (like in frenzy) one at the top and one at the bottom should be sufficient.  If the ladder is fairly long (more than 3 or 4 body lengths) you should have waypoints in the middle.  The waypoint paths will not automatically be created for ladders so you will manually have to use the "pathwaypoint create" commands to assign a path between these waypoints.  Use "pathwaypoint on" to see the paths.  Also make sure that there is a waypoint near the top of the ladder on the ground where the ladder stops and make sure that there is a waypoint path between the "top of ladder" waypoint and this waypoint.
