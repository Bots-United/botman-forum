Every bot that I play, nomatter what mod its for, it always brings up the sizebuf_t error. This happens only with the bots however. Is there any way of fixing this? I want to play but can't.

Make SURE you're using Half-Life version 1.1.0.1 and the latest version of whatever MOD you are trying to play.  If that doesn't fix it, try uninstalling Half-Life, re-install and update to version 1.1.0.1.

To get rid of this error you should delete the bot.cfg file and just manually add the bots.
