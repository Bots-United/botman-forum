When i put alot of bots in my TFC game, i can kill all the bots with one shot of a shotgun!

Very very weird, and very very annoying..
And BTW, the bots aren't shooting, they are just looking weird and are going after me... ok sometimes they shoot, but most of the time they just walk after you while there heads are twisting?

Well, it's cause of the team equalization feature. Let's say you were the only one on your team, and every other bot was on the other team, that's where the team equalization feature kicks in. If one team has less members than the other, the weapons on the team with less people are more stronger than they are normally, and the team with more members will have weaker weapons.

Oops, sorry, to get rid of the equalization feature, type: 

tfc_balance_teams 0

The default is:

tfc_balance_teams 1
