Subject: HPB Bots crashing dedicated server

I'm running Windows 2000, PII 450 / 128 MB RAM.  If I run a dedicated server with more than about 6 bots it crashes.  Less seems okay though, although I haven't troubleshooted all the factors (tried different class combinations, etc) to see if the actual number of bots is the problem. I can run an undedicated server with 12+ bots no problem. Anybody else run into this?  Know a fix?

Do you get any error message dialog boxes when it crashes or does it just go to the desktop?

If it just crashes to the desktop with no error message you should try uninstalling Half-Life, delete the Half-Life folder, re-install Half-Life and update to version 1.1.0.4 then install the HPB bot and try it again.

Welcome back, Botman! Did you enjoy your 2 week vacation?

Thanks for the quick response botman!  I'm running hlds.exe from the command prompt in one of win2k's dos-like windows. I start the server, start a map, and then after EXACTLY the 7th "Creating bot..." line appears, I get a Program Error dialog box and it crashes.  Usually freezes up the port too and I have to log out to free it up.  I've tried 4 and 6 bots and it seems stable.  Just FYI, the map run seems irrelevent.

Not a very helpful message, either. Says "hlds.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows.  You will need to restart the program."

Does this mean anything to you botman?  I got this error at the server console after about 30 minutes running 6 bots, then it crashed the same way and now it crashes instantly after even less bots!

No, those messages don't mean anything to me.  I know that Half-Life has problems running on Windows 2000.  You problems sound like they only occur on a dedicated server (which is a Win32 console application and not a Win32 windows executable).  I'm not sure what else you can try.  I know that Valve released a beta version of the Half-Life dedicated server a few weeks ago for server admins.  Maybe you can find a more recent version of the Win32 HLDS that has better support for Windows 2000.  Check the archives on www.planethalflife.com for news about the beta version of the Half-Life dedicated server.

That didn't help.  Darn.  Thanks anyway.  Its really not that big a deal.  I was mainly using bots to subvert the filters anyway.  4 is enough for that.

which version is the problem, i am using 5.30 beta right now and it is ok but not as good as my old driver was in win98.  the opengl support doesn't seem so hot.  I can't even use the 3d view in worldcraft anymore which really sucks  =(
I was hoping someone knew of a 3rd party driver that worked better than the nividia ones. 

thanks

thanks, i will check, i found some cool tweaks at 3dfiles.com that actually improved my frame rate by about 10 so if you have an nvidia card you might want to go check them out one is called nvmax and the other is called nvtweak.
