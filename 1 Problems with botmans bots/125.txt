Is there anybody who could tell me where i can tell the bot how he should to lean to use the rocketlauncher, to build and upgrade a sentry ( where to place the sentry) how to heal the temates ? Is there any way qho can learn this bot from me ? IS there one command which i need to tell him how he should to build or use something ?
I mean the skill level 5 is not the best skill, i think ! I did created 5 enemy bots vs me and i gotta kill everybody :-( so tell me if the bots could learn fro me and how....thats all ! :-)
Maybe someone has figured it out, i would be glad to read them !

Thanks for lsiting, i know its a alpha version....

By the way, i can imagine , that it isnt easy to programming such bots like in unreal tournament....but it would be great :-)

to make it build the sentry gun, try sending the build commands to the server :-)

The idea of making the bot learn, has probably occrued to many bot creators out there, and being that i am rather new to the half-life bot scene, i'm not sure what others have said on the topic, but here's what i'm currently thinking about/attempting.

The idea of a bot learning is simple, yet complex.  First of all, how does the bot remember an event?  My "solution" to the whole thing would be something as such.  The bot would read and write to a database.  When an even happened (events that where specific to the bot's mission ie. shooting the shotgun, building sentry, etc.) it would record all useful information such as position, how high the gun was pointing, where the attacker was, where the bot was, what the height difference was, where in the level, how fast, how many players on each team, etc.  For space limitations, the bot would purge out "slow" or "unuseful" entries every now and then somehow (that's not really important).  The idea here is that the bot would first of all record every possible scenario in the game, and only keep the good ones.  The "good ones" would be achived by averaging the data together, looking for the fastest, best way of doing a particular action.  That right here is probably the hardest part.  When a bot went to execute an action, it would consider where it was, then find the closet match in it's memory database, and use that.  

The biggest problem however would be space.  The player only has so much space, and even if all the bots did use the same database, that's a huge database.  With some work i think either this type of system, or something similar would actually help bots learn.

Just an idea.  Any comments?

PS. i was in no way implying that this replace waypoints.

I'm working on such a thing. The bot's I make will learn form the battles they fight. It alredy works. When Botman uploads his new HPB_bot version I think It will take 2 weeks before I upload the first version of my TFC_bot.
