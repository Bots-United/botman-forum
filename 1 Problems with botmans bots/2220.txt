Why do all your files in fileplanet (the ones that I checked at least) say that the files are provided from my server? I laughed my ass off when I saw it. If you can give me an answer, I would like to hear it, cuz maybe I could be able to laugh or something... :)

If you are talking about the "Personal Server" then yes, fileplanet will provide you with your own "personal" server where you have access to "your very own" server for only $6.95 US a month or $59.95 US a year.

You pay them moneny, they reserve a slot on one of their servers for you to connect to and download any files you want.  You never have to wait in line again if you are willing to pay the money to have your own "personal" server.

I had to go through a lengthy wait to download some files.  Botman, any interest in moving you files to alternate location(s)?  I can put some files up available for download, if you'll link to them.

I don't really have any interest in setting up any mirrors.  I actually kind of like the way fileplanet has done things where you don't have to keep checking an FTP site over and over and over competing with everyone else for a slot on a server.  I didn't like the fileplanet stuff at first, but once I get in line I know that I will be able to download the file within a few minutes.  With other FTP servers it's a crap shoot, sometimes you get lucky and can get a connection right away and other times you wait for an hour or more trying to get an FTP slot.  Also fileplanet seems to allow hundreds of downloaders simultaneously.  Most other FTP servers only allow a dozen or so people downloading at once.

Ah yes, FilePlanet... It was GREAT when it wasn't as well known, fast downloads and no wait times :)

Anyways, I do agree with their waiting in line system. IMO it's fair and I like the fact that you are guarenteed a download spot.

However, I hate lines tho, so I went and purchased the "Personal FP" access. So far it's been worth it, when people where waiting hours in line to download the new Return to Castle Wolfenstein, I had already downloaded it.

I understand where your coming from botman but consider my scenario...

Most of my upgrades to my linux server are done remotely and via command line (SSH/telnet). Lynx doesn't work with the fileplanet system unless you sit there hitting refresh over and over and you must press it at least 1 second quicker than the auto refresh script built into their webcode. This is even worse than the old ftp way. However with ftp I use a command line program called ncftp. With this program I can instruct it to connect to an ftp server. If that server is busy it will auto retry until it connects. When it connects it beeps my system speaker allowing me to do other stuff and switch back when I hear the beep. Then I can schedule a background download and log off my linuxbox. Behind the scenes the linux box keeps retrying to connect to server. When it does it starts downloading the file. If it gets disconnected during download it automatically reconnects and resumes the download at the point it left off.

So my ftp is not that bad but your fileplanet gives me all the same headaches that you claim it avoids as compared to ftp.

So perhaps having at least one mirror would be a good idea. The only saving grace is how small your program is. If I had to wait in line at fileplanet for the hlds_l patches I'd quit running a server. And may I suggest bluesnews.com as a potential mirror? Fileplanet might even list them on the botman download pages.

It's ALWAYS swamped right after a release comes out.  Wait 4 or 5 days then try downloading it.  The wait will be MUCH less.
