WHAT IS 4XAGP and 2XAGP? 
I know this is off topic but I cant seem to get relevant answers to my questions from anyone(technichians are stupid in our countery) so i turned to this forum
Its a stupid question but please help me....
WHAT IS 4XAGP and 2XAGP? many i asked say it is relevant to the compatibility between the motherboard and my 
video card(TNT2 Model 64, but what?!?, I have a detonator3,12.something and I have a directX 8.0) and Im having extreme errors right after I quit counterstrike(getting stuck, illegall operation etc...)

...now my parents forbid me to play and I have to lower the acceleration(which pretty much lowers the acceleration of the graphics, to temporarily relieve the computer of the errors I encounter on full accel.) 

Now I temporarily cant play..... anyway, Thank you for your attention Botman

AGP stands for "Advanced Graphics Port".  The AGP slot is a special slot on your motherboard designed to move data as quickly as possible from your CPU to your graphics card.

2X and 4X are used to indicate AGP slots that are twice as fast as normal or 4 times as fast as normal.  AGP graphics cards designed for 2X or 4X slots cannot be used in standard AGP graphics slots.  Some motherboards with 2X or 4X AGP slots can use the old 1X AGP type graphics cards (but some can't).  Check with your motherboard vendor to see which type of slot you have and which type of graphics cards it will handle.

Here's a pretty good tutorial on AGP from Intel...
