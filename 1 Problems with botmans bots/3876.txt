I run a TFC server on Linux, the bots load and run fine. However they never leave when the server fills up. I currently have 

maxplayers = 18

In my server. cfg. 

In the HPB_bot.cfg file located in the $mod$ directory, I have:

maxbots = 9

with no minbots statement. I want the bots to leave when players come on, but right now the server is full with 9 bots and 9 human players, and the bots won't leave. HELP!!! I must be doing something stupidly wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

I assume you have...

max_bots 9

...and not...

maxbots 9

...in your HPB_bot.cfg file.

You should also have...

min_bots 0

...in there as well.  Try setting "min_bots" to 0 and check to make sure you have "max_bots" and not "maxbots".
