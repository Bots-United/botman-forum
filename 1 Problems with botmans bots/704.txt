You're not supposed to be able to post as a Guest, but I don't think there's anything blocking your username from being "Guest".  You have to register (and login) before you can post.  You can only read as a guest.

I think he was saying he likes the number 0.

I like the number 5,682,341 because it doesn't have the same digit in it twice!

Hmmmmm.   All those "0" posts are mine.  I have no idea what happened.  I registered, logged in, and no matter what I typed it would put 0 as my post. Yabb bug maybe?  I created a new account and it works fine now.  I was just going to say that I had FLF waypoints available(check my signature).

Hmmmmm, your username the first time may have had strange characters in it that YaBB couldn't handle (like commas or semicolons or something).
