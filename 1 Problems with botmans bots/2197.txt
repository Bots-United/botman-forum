IVe fixed a lot of errors on your waypointing on badlands.bsp. the blue team is the hardcore enemy now since they get the flag from all sides but my editing didnt much affect the red but there seem to do pretty good too. my problem is if the addbot is a scout and would run for the flag via the sniper towers, the seem to aways fall off the hedge or ledge or whatever. But when I see a hwguy the seem to cross good to the enemy sniper towers. Ive noticed the scouts cant control their speed so thats why they always seem to fall off.
can you help me with my problem? thanks

anyways your bot is really great ;]

perhaps there is a path leading from a waypoint on the ledge to one on the ground, it will need to be removed by using pathwaypoint remove1, pathwaypoint remove2 etc.
