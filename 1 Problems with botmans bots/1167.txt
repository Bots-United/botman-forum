I managed to play 2fort with the latest hpb_Bot without HL crashing!!!

Load up the map then once you pick a team etc etc, go into the console and type "waypoint save" and return, then type "waypoint load" and the bots should be able to work without crashing!!! :D

Although the bots underwater navigation was a bit poor in 2fort.... ???? An HWGuy and an engineer fell in (as they do - just simply walked off the ledge ;)) and they just kept wandering around at the top of the water, they never went down the cave bits to get out of the water ... :( ...

Was this with the waypoint (*.wpt) files included with the HPB bot or with waypoint files from somewhere else?  I could believe bad waypoint files could case a crash, since I am only using the waypoints files that I distribute with my bot.

Oh, P.S. if you've got a copy of a waypoint file that causes a crash (assuming it's NOT one of the ones that comes with the HPB bot), please send it to me so that I can fix this problem.

Thanks.

It was the 2fort waypoint that comes with your hpb_bot.

I assumed that you didnt modify the waypoints since an older version of the bot, so I thought if i saved the current waypoints (to hpb_bot 4.2a version) and refresh them (load them again) they would work, and i think it worked! :)

Maybe there was a slight change in the waypoint code? But I dont know if i was using your 2fort waypoints, i assumed that I was becuase I used the install batch file to install the bot.

Actually I comapared the two waypoints on notepad. 

1) The 2fort waypoint that comes with the hpb_bot

and

2) the one that I save and loaded and worked properly

There was a slight difference between the waypoints somehow. I'll send u the waypoints that I save with the new version.

Okay, I'll take a look at them.  The 2fort.wpt file that comes with the HPB bot hasn't been modified since Oct 7th, 2000.  That should be the date on the file included in the 4.2a release.

It's strange that I haven't had any crashing problems with the unmodified file, and, saving it then loading it shouldn't change the data in the file.  I'll look at it this weekend and see if I can find anything.
