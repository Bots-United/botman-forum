The main reason that the bots do not follow the waypoints is because botman left out the navigation code for <b>you</b> to try yourself. It makes it better for you to try something different and work on something yourself rather than doing nothing and having a fully functional source code. If Botman's source code did have nav. code in it, it would be easy to just compile and flog it as your own bot.

I was confused too the first time I compiled a bot from the template, until I read that botman deliberately left out the navigation stuff :)
