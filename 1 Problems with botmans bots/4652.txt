I spent the day creating some waypoints.
I'd 1st point the map till i was satisfied with it & then i'd use "changelevel mapname", & then add some bots. No Problems.

Well, later after spending all this time for 9 HLDM maps, i decided to play a bit. Loaded the 1st map - No Problems. Map change, "Problem, No waypoints get loaded & i don't even get any type of error message". Ok, i thought maybe it's my Half-Life, so rather than post anything here "Figuring that you'd probably say, Re-Install HL", i figured on trying it on my 4.1.1.1 server over lan. 1st map loads, "No Problem"! mapchange = Problem", i can tell points didn't load. So i go & check server machine, Yup, it didn't create the "mapname.HPB_wp1". Ok, so i let it go till mapchange, Ahhh back to loading the waypoints agian & even the next map worked ok.

So anyway, i guess it skips the second map & continues to load maps afterwards? I was reading back some post's because i thought this was bought to your attention before, i see it was in diffrent results. Oh well, here's just another little doflicky.. I've never this problem in TFC cept for 1 map & this goes back to 2001, it's Neil Mankie's
"Vidar2".. I downloaded the points from waypointwarehouse & the file size is 11kb, but they just won't load. Oh well.. Just figured i'd post this in case somebody else is haveing difficulty's? Not that it helps though i guess.. ???

If I remember correctly, I had speculated it might have something to do with the UPPERcase verses lowercase letters in the filename.  Windows is not case sensitive for filenames, but Linux is.

Perhaps this is a 'Linux server' only type problem.  If you are running on Linux, you might want to try the same tests on Windows and see if you have different results (the only difference in the file loading code is using '/' for Linux directory separators in the filename and using '\' on Windows).

If it's not something to do with the wrong case in the filename (i.e. letters in the waypoint filename don't match the case of letters in the map file name), then I have no idea what the problem may be.
