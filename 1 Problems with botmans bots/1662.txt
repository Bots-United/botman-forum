I don't know.  Other people have mentioned this, but I never can seem to get it to happen when I am debugging.  Maybe it's a specifc map (I don't see why this would matter).  Maybe it's something about your server.cfg file that different than mine.  Maybe there's some "magic" sequence of commands that you are doing this I am not (i.e. kick bot, addbot, change team, kick bot, change team, addbot, change model, change team, kick bot, etc.)
