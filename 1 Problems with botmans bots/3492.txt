The source code is used to compile the bot DLL file (the executable).  You can edit the source code to add new features to the bot or change existing features.  You will need to understand the C programming language and have some knowledge about the Half-Life SDK in order to modify the HPB bot source code.

The waypoint files are used to help the HPB bot navigate the maps.  Read the HPB_bot_waypoint.txt file in the Half-Life\HPB_bot directory to understand what waypoints are and how the bot uses them.

The waypoint files go in the MOD's "maps" folder.  For example, Half-Life\cstrike\maps or Half-Life\tfc\maps.

Also,

Most maps, like the ones from WaypointWharehouse still have the old .wpt file. Make sure it has the .HPB_wpt extention for it to work.

I also found out, FoXBot waypoints will not work with the HPB bot. :( I tried renaming them, but it will not load the file. Possibly a different file format then the HPB bot's waypoint file system.
