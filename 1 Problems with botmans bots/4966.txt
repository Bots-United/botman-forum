You'll have to modify the bot source code to get them to shoot at monsters.

I have another question for you, Botman.
I can't set the dlls for the combat.ccp of the bots, so there are another bot mods (RealBot, JoeBot etc.) for CS that work well with the monster plugin? I would that the bots shoot at the monster :(

You should be able to modify the combat.cpp code so that bots look for entities with the FL_MONSTER bit set in the flags.

Currently the code just loops through all the players, but you could modify it to loop through players, then (if it doesn't find a player), loop through all entities looking for one with the FL_MONSTER bit set in the pEdict->flags variable.

Search this forum for "FL_MONSTER" for related threads.  See this one for example...
