Hey botman,

    Are you going to work on any other bots for HL?  I liked the bots you have made, but bot10 I think it was, was too hard to kill, unless I came from behind it with a rpg, and got a direct hit, and they killed me in like 2 shots, and took a million for me to kill them, but like your bots in general, especially the HPB_Bot for TFC.

I will only be working on the HPB bot from now on.  But the HPB bot does work in Half-Life, TFC, OpFor and CS.

I know, I noticed, I went to see what waypoints would do to it, but all WP's do, is lead them to on point to where they meet, and then they start banging on each other with crowbars, but if not WP's, they don't know too much shit.  And they seem to shoot me when they see me through the smallest cracks, sometime....  Well, most.....  I don't even know where the last bot killed me from.
