Sorry, I probably can't help much with this one since I'm not updating my HPB bot code anymore.

The only suggestion that I have would be to edit the waypoints for maps where there are problems and move them around slightly or just delete those points completely and force the bots to go another direction.

See the HPB_bot_waypoint.txt file for details on editing the waypoint files.

I remember vidar2. I usually play on the Red Team. The engineer bots are always looking up at the sky at the flag area instead of building sentrys and dispensers.

Tried removing the waypoints, but they keep stopping, looking up, then move an inch, and keep doing it.

They also get stuck at the bottom of the ladders to the upper level in this same room where the flag is.
