This isnt a problem with the bots, but the "Freeze gun" tutorial you wrote over at hlpp.valveworld.com

I did everything you wrote in the tutorial, and I got no compiling errors.

But in the game when I try to use the freeze gun (secondary fire on egon) Half-Life crashes.

Do you know what might be the problem?

You probably have a problem with a pointer somewhere.  If you are using Microsoft Visual C++, compile the Win32 Debug version and run the DLL under the debugger to determine where the crash is occuring, then you can double check that against the code in the tutorial.

Thanks anyways botman, but I found the problem about 20 minutes ago.

It seems like it only crashes if you're walking or running while using the freezegun. I fixed that.

BTW, Im using MingW32. Is it possible to allow any of the monster entities in multiplayer with defaultai?

I want to have the mini-turret be a weapon you can deploy, is that possible with Ming?
