If you start with the Half-Life Full SDK (the one that has hl.dsp and hl.dsp and builds hl.dll) then you can cut-and-paste stuff from the Bot Number 10 source code and place it into the same files in the Full SDK.

DO NOT just overwrite the files in the Full SDK with the ones from Bot Number 10.  THIS WILL NOT WORK!!!  You MUST cut and paste individual changes from the Bot Number 10 source code files into the same files from the Full SDK.

You will also need to copy all of the bot*.cpp and bot*.h files from the Bot Number 10 source code into the Full SDK dlls directory and then add those .cpp files to the project.

Once you have built the hl.dll file with the Bot Number 10 stuff merged in, you can create monsters in the game just like you can in Half-Life Single Player.
