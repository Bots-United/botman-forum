If you like botman's bot so much, tray my bot to.
I think it is better in combat becouse it can strafe and it throws grenades.

Will your bot conflict with the HPB Bot?

Ares m8 from what I have seen your bot is very fun to play with however there are a few problems like there are with all bot development :)

1). Hl crashes after 5 mins without any error messages at all.

2). ON 2fort the bots tend to get congested around the sniper area a lot.

3). Bots tend to end up in the water a lot and cant get out

4). You dont have a forum :) LoL :D
