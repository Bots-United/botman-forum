Ok. I downloaded the bot. the upgrade for HL. It all works. Except that i cant play TFC with more than 3 bots and myself. The maxplayers variable is set to 4. I cant change it i tried in almost every *.cfg file i felt i could play arround in.
You cant change the variable from the console. I would really like some input and feedback because (as silly as it sounds) Im getting tired of winning EVERY time i play.

                                 Thnx
                                  Syko

ok, if you have less than 32 megs of ram you will get this error, there is a little thing you can add to the cmd line, but i cant recall it right now.  I'll post the cmd to put in the cmd line when i find it.

-heapsize 20000
that should work
to add this to the cmd line, go to the shortcut and RIGHT CLICK IT, then go to properties.  Then add -heapsize 20000 to the end of the target box.
So it would look like this if you installed half-life to c:\sierra\Half-Life\

C:\Sierra\Half-Life\hl.exe -heapsize 20000

that should work to fix your maxplayers problem
