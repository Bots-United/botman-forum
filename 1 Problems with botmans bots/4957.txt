If you are using texture names that already exist in other .wad files the BSP viewer may find those textures before it finds your custom textures.

I would recommend changing the names of the textures in your custom map so that they don't clash with texture names from other .wad files.

i've only taken my own textures and they've got german names so there cant be textures with same name. there is really no texture on the right palce.
