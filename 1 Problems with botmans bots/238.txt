Some stuff...

1) BUG: SHORT PAUSE waypoints made the blue team members completely grind to a halt and they never moved at ALL until i removed the waypoint to a normal one. The red team seemed to get through ok for some reason though, i don't know if it affected them.

2) TOTALWAR waypoints finished (for now), get em at http://www.waypointwarehouse.8k.com

3) TOTALWAR ROCKS, they get the flag and cap succesfully although I'm having a bit of trouble with the blue team capturing the flag (or is it the red team?) anyway, they're great! Just what I was trying to get them to do for ages...!

4) Bots still get stuck at ladders (move up and down constantly) So just for the quality of the TOTALWAR waypoints, I removed some waypoints at ladders (exclusing the ones that get them to the capture point, they can seem to get up to it ok, thank goodness)
