hi everyone :)
just trying to understand how bot works ...
how does a bot see you ...does hpb bot use the waypoints to detect you ...that is what i thought but that can not be cause when i play say hldm or dmc on a map i dont have waypoints for you see a bot come in a room and then it seems to me anyway that he "sees" you and come running and firing at you..
anyway thanks and well i have not posted here much and i probadly have said this before but hey botman thanks for your bot i am having so much fun playing hpb bot with dmc hldm and tfc

The HPB bot source code includes a ReadMe.txt file that tells how to get the bot to "see" items around them.  I suggest you download the HPB bot source code and read it.

Visibility checks can be made by tracing lines from one point in space to another point in space.  The engine will tell you if there was something blocking the path from point A to point B (and it will tell you what you hit if something was in the way).  You can also get the point contents of points in space to determine if a point is inside a solid area, in open space, under water, etc.

Using the visibility stuff plus scanning for entities within a certain radius of the bot's origin is the only method the bot has of "seeing" things.

ok thanks botman 
i understand i think he he what you are saying ..
i am no computer programmer etc lol ..i think i was wondering if the bot has a vision of surrondings like we do ..you know if you watch a bot on first person view with cs these days ..well
i mean does the bot have a "tron like vision" he he you know what i mean ..or a "graph" "tracer" type of vision .. with these types of visions do they maybe give the bot an idea of your form etc

If you want to look at the world the way a bot does, close one eye.  Hold a soda straw up to the other eye (so that you can only see one point in space at a time).  That's the way the bot "sees" the world (one point in space at a time).

You'll need to use the "Update" item in the menu or download the latest Half-Life update from www.fileplanet.com (or other site).  The latest version of Half-Life is 1.1.1.0, so you should update to that version before trying to install the bot.

It won't work.  Unless you purchased the CD very recently.  The original engine version was 1.0.0.5, but many months later they started distributing CDs with engine version 1.0.1.0.

Bots weren't supported on the Half-Life engine until version 1.0.1.3 (so you have to upgrade to at least that version for bots to work at all).

My Bot Number 8 will support engine 1.0.1.3 through engine 1.0.1.6.  Bot Number 9 and 10 and the HPB bot REQUIRE engine 1.1.0.0 or higher.  Lower engine versions WILL NOT WORK AND WILL CRASH.

The current engine version is 1.1.1.0.

hee hee hee I'm proud to be the only bot maker to make my bots "see" more than one point at a time... RACC really does store and use *all* his field of view, and even more on the new template I'm working on... Check out the "technical" section of my website if you are interested in further information.

I was thinking of some more effecient ways of finding whats in the bots vision.

I was thinking maybe holding a linked list with all the entities the bot can see (In FOV and Visible, also maybe only store the entities that you want it to see or all of them) and update the list once per frame (Not just per frame, perhaps after a certain time, like the bot's reaction time) 

Then in later parts of the code, when looking for buttons, enemies, doors whatever, just search through the list to see if its in the list instead of having to check if its in FOV and visible again (using up a lot of CPU power ;)).

I was thinking maybe that is what you done with your bot PM? Cos I haven't had a big look at your source but you seem to boast about your FOV handling :)

that's exactly what I am doing in the new template I'm working on...

What a jerk.. advertise on a forum where someone cares about YOUR bots!

Oh yea.. and nice website.. might want to "modify" your "technical" section to actually be ONLINE.

lol

WTF is the problem with you man ?

I've been on botman's forum for quite a time and we had a lot of interesting discussions about bot sensing, and what I said is true. I'm no spammer wanting to advertise anything. My bot is open source, waypointless, and currently the best waypointless one AFAIK. There may be others, but I haven't ever head of them. Many people have tried it and many have visited the site. If you can't, not my fault. Do a traceroute to it and you'll probably realise that's your ISP who's blocking you. My pages are online, and reachable.

And one last thing, try to know a lil better the people you are flaming. Else, if other people in this forum think I'm advertising for nothing, I ask them to reply and confirm.
