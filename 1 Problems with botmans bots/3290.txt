No, it does not crash. It works perfectly. But, whenever I spawn monsters AND bots, the monsters shoot the bots, but the bots don't shoot the monsters. Most of the time they die.

Is there any way to make the bots shoot the monsters?

No, not right now.  I will probably be releasing a new version of the HPB bot where you can configure the bots to attack the monster or not.  Some people like the fact that the bots don't attack the monsters and instead attempt to complete the goal (like capturing the flag, etc.).
