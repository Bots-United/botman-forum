When will the bots be able to support level change. I HATE having to play one damn map, then remaking the game to switch lvls =[. If there suppost to switch levels then why does me half-life crash?

I have been reworking stuff with the "map" command and think I have fixed (or greatly reduced) the problem with map changes causing crashes.  You can always set up a time limit (in the Advanced options) to change maps after a fixed time limit.

The new release this coming weekend will have these changes for the "map" command.  The release should be out sometime Sunday evening (around 6:00 PM Eastern time).

P.S. Don't use the "changelevel" command to change maps.  There is an Half-Life engine bug that doesn't kick bots from the server before a map change.  This cause the engine to crash.  Always use the "map" command instead of the "changelevel" command.

Will the "changelevel" command ever be fixed, is there a fix for it anywhere? Does every single bot have this problem!?

I have bound keys which "add" and "kick" the bots. That way if I am running a public server I can easily remove the bots before I changelevel then once the new map loads quickly load them back up.

Leon Hartwig (of Phineas Bot) at Valve was working on a fix for the "changelevel" command.  I have not seen anything from him about this fix.  I'll e-mail him and let you know what he says.

Here's what I got back from Leon...

QUOTE:
Yes, my changes for this went into the patch.  I haven't tested this with the released version of 1104, but unless some other code changed that conflicted with my changes, bots should work OK now with 'changelevel'. Also, if you recall, when a 'map' command was issued, the bots were silently cleared from the game and you had to include special code to handle this. Now, the bots are correctly kicked off a server when a 'map' command happens, complete with the disconnect callback.  So, aside from changelevel2 which is broken with or without bots, all level changes should work correctly, and the disconnect callback should always be called when a bot is leaving the game for any reason.  If you find that this is ever not the case, let me know and I'll work on it.

There you go.  Leon says "map" and "changelevel" should work better in the 1.1.0.4 release.
