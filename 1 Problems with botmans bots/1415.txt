I've also noticed
what I think is a bug in HolyWars where the players sometimes stop doing damage
to each other (you shoot and shoot and shoot and nobody gets hurt). 

Yeah, i just noticed that too.. Happened maybe like only 5mins into the game.
WoW!! I can't wait till you release the next version of the HPB for Holy Wars.. Dam, What a Cool Mod!!! That's sooo Cool that you've added support for it!!! Awesome!!!!!!!

Yup, but it needs a few more weapons (2 or 3).  It needs some larger maps.  I couldn't imaging a server with 20 people on some maps that small.  It also needs a few more models (although you can use the Valve player models like the bots do by switching to them after you've joined the game or by copying them to the MODs models\player folder).  Also the Saint can be REALLY hard to kill if they are a good deathmatch player.

At least it's a little bit different concept with everybody ganging up on one player and isn't just another Counter-Strike clone.
