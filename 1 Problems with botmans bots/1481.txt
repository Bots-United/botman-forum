I've made a little serverside mod (nothing much changed, rate of fire.. small things as that..) and no new entities of any kind.. I thought there would be no problem to play with HPB bot.. bot when i starts a sever, Half-Life just exits to the desktop?.. no error messages.. Is it just so that it doesn't work, or have I done something wrong?.. I've copied the files that gets copied to /valve and edited liblist.gam....

(I've also tried to implement your "bot 9" but that wouldn't work.. maybe I just mixed up the files or something)

The HPB bot DLL file will only work with...

valve\dlls\hl.dll
cstrike\dlls\mp.dll
tfc\dlls\tfc.dll
gearbox\dlls\opfor.dll
frontline\dlls\frontline.dll
holywars\dlls\holywars.dll

...no other MOD DLLs (or directories) are supported by the HPB bot.

You could rename you MOD to one of the above directories and rename your MOD DLL to the corresponding DLL name and then the HPB bot should load it without problems.

"what about getting HPB to run with adminmod?  on linux?"

Search the Admin MOD forum for "bot" to learn how to configure the admin.ini file to load a bot DLL file.  HPB bot (and Admin MOD) work on both Win32 and Linux.

"how do I know which is the select team and weapons with these writebyte?"

Read the ReadMe.txt file that comes with the HPB bot source code template.  You'll have to figure out what bytes are used for what by trial and error or comparing the MOD network messages to similar messages in the Half-Life Standard SDK.

Thanks botman! 
but sometimes when I try to spawn bots with other mods like Arcana Mysteria Magica  and try in the console "addbot" it exits the game and back to my desktop.
All the entities are there and I modified it with the valve id because it's a deathmatch.
Is HPB_BOT compatible with all mods?

"Is HPB_BOT compatible with all mods?"

No, it will only support the 6 MODs listed at the top of this thread.

You can modify the HPB bot template source code to MAKE it compatible with other MODs but you have to know what you are doing when you change things.

I followed all your instruction botman, I added all the entities in the linkfunc, modified the valve_id in h_export with the "dll" of the mod.

I can spawn in the game and all entities we there, no errors in developers mode, but when I "addbot" the game exit back to my desktop.

what could be wrong?

I don't know.  If you have Microsoft Visual C++, you should try building the Debug version and running Half-Life in the MSVC debugger to determine where it it crashing.

Try reinstalling Half-Life and patch up to version 1,1,0,6. Maybe your Half-Life is corupt. Or try reinstalling the bot.

Hi, I'm trying to create a bot for the Blood For Honor Bot but they don't spawn, I hear them sapawn but they are nowhere in the map! I forced them choosing a class but they don't seem to choose it even if the sound I hear is the correct one... I think I did everything written in the readme.txt but it doesn't work... Bouhouhou...
