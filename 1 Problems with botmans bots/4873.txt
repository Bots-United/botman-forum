Hye
i m a newbie and i ve made a cs 1.6 server on linux. I have tried to install hpb with install file bit it wasn't workind. So i made it in root ( copy all files in cs root exept I486.so in dlls of cs ) and i modify the lilist.gam ( add line 
//gamedll_linux  " dlls/cs_i386.so"
gamedll_linux "dll/hpb_i386.so" i have to midfy the name because he wanted to find those file a start ??? )

Well the server is begining well ( no error message ) but i cant add bot or sea waypoint or else by typping commands in the console. He told me he did'nt know the commands

So what's wrong ( i think it s the installation but the tex file seems to be for win version not for linux ... )

Thanks for replying ;-)

The linux server doesn't support adding, deleteing or viewing waypoints.  You HAVE to run a Windows machine as a listen server to edit or view waypoints.

To add a bot on the linux server, you must use "HPB_bot addbot" on the command line.  If you are trying to add bots to a remote server (using rcon), the command would be...

rcon "HPB_bot addbot"

...don't forget the double quotes, they are required.
