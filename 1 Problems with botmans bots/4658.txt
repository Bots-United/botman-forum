Hey,

I am running stripper2 on my linux server (cs 1.5) and I cant seem to get stripper to remove the light entity from my maps. I have tried adding it to the _str.cfg files for my maps and even the stripper2.cfg file. I know that stripper 2 is installed correctly becuase it is adding sprites that i have under the [add], it just wont remove the "light" entity. Any ideas?

[strip]
light <-- wont work
[add]

Are you SURE there is an entity in the map called "light"?

Did you dump the map entities using my BSP_tools.exe or ripent.exe (from Zoner's Half-Life tools)?

Well i decompiled the map using winBSP and there are light entities, called "light". Ive also tried removing light_spot and light_environment, even though they arent in the map. I just cant strip the light for some reason.

Light entity: http://collective.valve-erc.com/index.php?ent=light

I used ripent.exe and this is the light i am trying to remove:

{
"origin" "88 -868 1732"
"style" "4"
"_light" "255 45 45 200"
"classname" "light"
}

Ive also tried:
light (88 -868 1732)
and
_light
 and they dont work

Stripping does work becuase I can strip the armoury entity. Ive tried removing light from almost everymap i have... :\

You can remove them, but you will see no visible change.

So I cant remove any sources of light from the map?

try Botmans darkulator, that probably does what you want. The light information is compiled into the BSP itself, the entities just tell the map compiler where the lights will be, they serve no purpose once the map is actually built*.

*Except dynamic lights, like togglables.

botman i remember seeing someone take the elevator doors on lambda bunker and making it so that you could walk right through them.  is it possible to do such a thing with stripper2?  is there a more complete documentation of what stripper2 can do?  im adding in guns and crap but i'd like to know exactly what i can do and the little readme.txt that comes with it doesnt give me much info.  i'm a mapper so i know all about entities but im unclear as to whether u can modify entities with it such as a wall

You can remove a brush model (func_wall, func_door) and spawn a cloned brush model with a different entity (func_illusionary for example) and that would give the effect you want.

The limit to Stripper2 is basically the same as the limits of creating a map with Worldcraft/Hammer with the exception that you can't create any new brush models (you can only clone brush models that already exist in the map).

Is there any examples or documentation I can look at to see how this is done using Stripper2?
