Subject: Does Stripper Work With HLDS?

I searched past messages, and this seems like such an obvious question, but everything on the Stripper info page only describes how it works with the Listenserver.  But how about the HLDS?  And if not, is there a workaround, short of running the Server Admin Mod?

Thanks everyone!

Stripper will work with with the Win32 dedicated server.  There isn't a version of Stripper for Linux dedicated servers.  You will have to use the Half-Life menus to select the weapons/ammo you want to strip out then exit from hl.exe.  You will notice that the changes have been made to the "settings.scr" file.  You can copy these same settings to your server.cfg file before starting the dedicated server.

ok, settings.scr tells me it is a screen saver file.  I try to rename it and it keeps the .scr

I want to copy the setting over to the server.  

Bless you for making this work.

.scr is the Windows Screen Saver extension, but you can get around it.  Here's how:

(1) Go to your Windows\SendTo folder
(2) Add a shortcut to Notepad
(3) Right-click on the .scr file in Explorer, select Send To from the context menu, then Notepad

Note: you can do this with any text file, but if it pops up a dialog asking to open it in Wordpad, just click OK.  In this case, the file is too big for Notepad to open (more than 64K, I think)

This works in Windows 98, but I'm not sure if Win95 has a SendTo folder.

Here's an e-mail I sent to someone a few weeks ago about setting up my Stripper Add-On with the freely available Windows dedicated server...


Run the Half-Life\stripper\valve\install.bat file to install the
stripper.dll and liblist.gam file (or just copy the
Half-Life\stripper\dlls\stripper.dll file to the Half-Life\valve\dlls folder
and copy the Half-Life\stripper\valve\liblist.gam to the Half-Life\valve
folder).

Use Notepad (or your favorite text editor) to add the following to the
bottom of your Half-Life\valve\game.cfg file...

"mp_strip_weapon_357"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_357"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_9mmAR"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_9mmAR"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_9mmbox"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_ARgrenades"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_9mmhandgun"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_9mm"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_crossbow"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_crossbow"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_gauss"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_gaussclip"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_egon"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_handgrenade"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_hornetgun"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_rpg"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_rpgclip"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_satchel"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_shotgun"  "0"
"mp_strip_ammo_buckshot"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_snark"  "0"
"mp_strip_weapon_tripmine"  "0"
"mp_strip_item_battery"  "0"
"mp_strip_item_healthkit"  "0"
"mp_strip_item_longjump"  "0"
"mp_strip_func_button"  "0"
"mp_strip_func_healthcharger"  "0"
"mp_strip_func_recharge"  "0"
"mp_strip_func_ladder"  "0"
"mp_strip_func_tank"  "0"
"mp_strip_func_water"  "0"

...and change the 0's to 1's for things you want to STRIP out.

Run hlds.exe like you normally would and things should be removed from each
map that gets loaded.

"func_healthcharger" is the wall mounted health chargers.  "func_recharge"
is the wall mounted HEV chargers.  "func_tank" are the player controlled
sentry guns.  "ammo_buckshot" is the shotgun ammo.  The rest are
self-explanatory.

Note that you can't strip out the 9mm pistol or the crowbar that the player
spawns with, but then we all know how much you LOVE the crowbar anyway CF!

This is a server only MOD and will not require any changes on the client
side.

If you have problems getting it set up, just e-mail me.

If enough people are intested I can convert the Stipper stuff to Linux to
make it usable on Linux servers as well, but so far only one other person
has asked about this.


...the game.cfg file normally only exists with the Single player version of Half-Life, so if it doesn't exist for your hlds, just create one with this at the top...


"mp_teamlist"            "robo;hgrunt"
"mp_fraglimit"            "0.000000"
"mp_timelimit"            "0.000000"
"mp_falldamage"            "0"
"mp_teamplay"            "0"
"mp_friendlyfire"            "0"
"mp_weaponstay"            "0"
"mp_forcerespawn"            "0"
"mp_footsteps"            "1"
"mp_flashlight"            "0"
"mp_autocrosshair"            "0"
"sv_sendvelocity"            "1"

...and then add the Stripper stuff from above.
