Which MOD?  If Half-Life deathmatch, is it teamplay or not?  Have you tried other MODs to see if the same thing happens?

I don't know what to tell you unless it's teamplay and you added bots all on the same team.  If it's just plain old Half-Life deathmatch and you are using the default bot.cfg file they should shoot each other as soon as they see another player.

Try other maps like stalkyard, crossfire, or boot_camp, since I know that those definitely work fine.
