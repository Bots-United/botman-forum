I installed the HPB bots, I have version 1.0.1.5 or whatever its called (Opposing Forces update) but the damn thing keeps on comming up with a message box stating "Invalid DLL file". Does anyone know what I should do?

Oh yeah, I have tried re-installing the game, then the bots, but it still doesnt work.

Thanks

You should upgrade your Half-Life to version 1.1.0.8, which is the latest. The bot DLL is compiled with support for latest version only (the function tables are not the same).
