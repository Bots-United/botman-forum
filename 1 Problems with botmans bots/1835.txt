Ok, I'm running Win 2K Pro and I've got a local network as well as a cable connection. When I run TFC 1.5 after installing the HPB bot, no bots join  the game. Is there something else I have to set up to get them to jump in? TFC really sucks when I'm the only player. 

Thanks for the help!

After unzipping the HPB bot .exe file, did you run the Install.bat file in the HPB_bot\tfc folder?  If not, read the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file found in the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder.

Can you use the "bot addbot" command from the server console to add bots?
