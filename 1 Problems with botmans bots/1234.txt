"addbot name level" is NOT the proper form of the command.

You want "addbot <team> <class> <name> <skill>", where <team> is the team number (1-4), <class> is the player class (0-9), <name> is any valid player name and <skill> is a skill level (1-5).  For example...

"addbot 1 5 MrClean 4"

...will create a bot on team 1 (the blue team) using class 5 (the medic) with a player name of "MrClean" and using skill level 4 (easy).

I use specific config files for each map. Since I modify them alot and can't be arsed to remember what number is what class I modified my config file to include commented out notes.


# addbot (team 1 or 2) (class 1 - 9) (name) (skill level 1 best - 5 worst)
# Team 1 = Blue Team 2 = Red
# 1=scout 2=sniper 3=soldier 4=Demo  5=medic
# 6=HWGuy 7=Pyro 8=Spy  9=Engineer

addbot 1 6 GrepMaster(SPO) 1
addbot 2 6 -=Ace=-(SPO) 1
addbot 1 5 Mozilla(SPO) 1
addbot 2 5 Botman(SPO) 1
