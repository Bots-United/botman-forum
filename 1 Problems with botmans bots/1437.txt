Did the changes I made to the Linux release (version 1.2a) fix the Segmentation Violation problems?

Hey Botman - I've been trying to email you as "botman@mailandnews.com" as per your front page, but I can't seem to get through.

Am I using the right address??

cheers, Bird

Yes, but my e-mail server (mailandnews.com) is down.  They have been down for a week and expect to get things going again later this week.

Just post a message here or use the "Send message" function when viewing my Profile to send me a private message.

Nope. It's still crashing. The gdb output :

Loaded symbols for /usr/local/games/halflife/cstrike/dlls/cs_i386.so
#0  0x425c6fee in UTIL_BuildFileName () from /usr/local/games/halflife/cstrike/dlls/HPB_bot_i486.so
(gdb) where

Different memory adresses.

Okay, I'll go back and have another look.  It wasn't what I thought it was.

Okay, I stripped out the BotLogo stuff that I added to the GameDLLInit() function (since the Linux dedicated server doesn't support bot logos at the moment).  The BotLogo stuff was the only thing that I added to GameDLLInit() between the 1.0 release and the 1.2 release.

I can't figure out why UTIL_BuildFileName() would be crashing, but the BotLogo stuff appears right before the UTIL_BuildFileName call in GameDLLInit and I'm hoping that somehow this was causing the Segmentation Violation.  I REALLY wish I was able to duplicate this problem on my Linux box so I could run things under the debugger to figure out exactly where it's crashing.

Maybe this release will fix the problem.  Please try this one and reply back in this thread if it works or if the same problem keeps happening...

P.S. If you still have the problem after downloading the new 1.2b release, could you also post the filesize of the HPB_bot_i486.so file in the halflife/cstrike/dlls folder?

Sorry for you having to go through all this trouble.  I know you're probably getting a little tired of this.  :)

At last ;)

Yep, this fixed the problem.

PD: Tired ? naaa, I'm glad I could help you with this problem. The only painful experience is downloading things from Fileplanet using Lynx. They should have a "Linux friendly" version ;)

Yay!  ;D  Dang, now I gotta figure out what I did in the BotLogo stuff that broke the Linux code.  :(

Oh well, glad to know that it's working now.  Have fun!
