You should mark the waypoints in the defender's area as team 2 so that the attackers don't wander into that area and get killed by the turrets.  You should mark the waypoints in the attacker's area as team 1 so that the defenders dont' wander into that area and get killed by turrets.

You can have multiple tags on a waypoint, for example you could have a defend/crouch/door waypoint if you wanted to just by crouching in front of a door, setting a waypoint, marking it as a defend waypoint and marking it as a door waypoint.
