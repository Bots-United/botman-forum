"crossfire.bsp is version 29, not 30"

Which version of crossfire are you using (the one from Half-Life deathmatch?).

If you haven't upgraded your Half-Life engine to the latest version (which is 1.1.1.0), you should do that first.

It looks just like you are using an old outdated version of that map.

That map was made with an older version of the map compile tools and is not supported by my BSP Tools utilities.

Yes, you will have to switch to the Half-Life version of crossfire if you want to use it.
