Hey there. I know that the new HLDS is a beta, and you shouldn't be expected to completely support it, but for some reason it detects my HPB bots as having a corrupt system clock (that is, speed cheating) and kicks them ALL off my server. Now, I can imagine several reasons for this, but you'd probably just have to ask valve how they're checking for speed cheating, and make the bots return the right response (unless it's the problem that the bots have no IP, which it may be...)

Anyways, just thought I'd let you know.

You better check again!

My server runs 24/7 with 4 bots and not one bot has been kicked for speed cheating. I installed the patch on Friday. Sure you don't have the speed cheat running on your computer?

sounds like you have the speed cheat to me too, the bots run off your computer so if you have speed cheat they do , server probably cant kick you because you are admin :-) so i think you are cheater!!! lol ;D;D;D

lol. No, I don't have the speed cheat! :-) I do have a program that monitors my processor, though, to check if it's overheating and checks the voltage and so forth, so maybe that's it. It's a VIA Athlon, so it's probably just being finicky.
     Thanks for letting me know that this isn't universal. Just to note--I haven't been getting kicked off cheatfixed servers, either, so I don't think that it's entirely in my hardware.

      And thanks for the great bots! They're really helping out the server population.

If you are overclocking your processor you may be adversely effecting the system's time.  If you frequently notice that your computer gains minutes (or hours) each day then the server believes you are using the speed cheat.

Either disable your overclocking or revert back to the 1.1.0.4 server until Valve corrects this problem.

Actually he could still use 1105 as the speed hack is merely a patch atop the 1105 patch. Speed Cheat patch could be applied to 1105 or 1104. 

Which brings me to a little pet peeve. Why do the change the code and use the same damn version number. That just creates confusion when discussing problems. By just stating you have a problem and have version 1105 doesn't really tell anyone what server software you have.

Ha! I'm not overclocked, but it could be one of a few things: 1) My processor runs at ~807 Mhz, not 800, for some reason. 2) I have a lot of recording equipment around my computer, and it could be causing just enough electromagnetic interference to disrupt the system clock crystal. (Are there still crystals on MB's?)

     I do lose time, but I always have, and I did with my last computer, too. I have a timesync to keep it in place. (but it's not running while HLDS is running, so it's not that either.)

     Also, I'm positive that 1560 and 1559 servers don't detect me as speed cheating when I get on their servers (since I'm not...). It's only the bots on my server that get it.

     Anyways, I guess that's enough on this topic. I'll just leave it at: it's all weird.
