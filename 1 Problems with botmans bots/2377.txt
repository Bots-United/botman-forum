The bot is a computer controlled player that will run around in a level and try to shoot you (and other bots).

Download the .exe file and run it then extract the files to your Half-Life folder (where hl.exe is located).  Use Windows Explorer to browse into the Half-Life folder and look in the HPB_bot folder for a "HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt" file.  Read that text file to learn how to install the bots for the MOD that you want, how to add or remove bots and how to configure the skill level of the bots.
