Botman -
What maps have you playe on? I know for SURE that the following maps would be VERY easy to navigate if you implement the waypoint system into Op4CTF:

op4ctf_crash - There is absolutely nothing that the bots would have trouble with on this map. They won't be able to MAYBE climb the ladder to the sniper tower or take the undeground sewer way, BUT they dont need to go there to meet the maps objectives. Crash is an easy map to navigate and would be SO EASILY WAYPOINTED. If you release a version that works with Op4CTF i will definitely waypoint this map. The gameplay would be fast and furious.

op4ctf_mortar - Yet another map that is just as easy to waypoint and navigate as above. If u integrate the waypoint system the bots will have no problem whatsoever : -)

op4ctf_repent - As before a very easy map to navigate. Very large but manageable. The bots DO NOT have to take the shortcuts that require crouching or climbing ladders to get to the flag AS before.

op4ctf_chasm - This map would be VERY hard to make it compatible with bots. They would most likely fall off all the time.

op4ctf_biodomes - This map may work, BUT the high observation areas would pose a large problem as they would continually fall off. I could try to waypoint it.

op4ctf_wonderland - Easy map although i dont know about the creek in the center. Maybe they could even take the shortcuts.

op4ctf_gunyard - I forgot how this map looked. I think it was similar to mortar.

op4ctf_xendance - Definitely not. 

Consider these please : - )

BTW The maps in oppising force are not dark at all. I wonder what u meant by that. They are the same light quality as the regular hl maps.

If you waypoint those maps and they work, please notify me.

Repent was one of the ones that I had randomly picked to look at.  I don't remember what the other one was.  I'll go back and look at the ones you mentioned and if they are fairly simple (like 2FORT in TFC) then I'll add the CTF support to OpFor.

Ok, but I'm badly waiting for a Op4CTF bot. I have all ready made a super waypoint for Acropolis2 (TFC map) and im getting started on other well-made use made maps as well as the official ones. 
Definitely try Op4ctf_crash; it is so easy to waypoint i dream of waypointing it.
Also look at Op4ctf_mortar and gunyard
Please botman op4ctf is a very unique mod and its a delightful change from normal tfc ctf.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

Yep, all of the maps he mentioned as being managable I would definatly agree on. 

I think I like waypoints too much, because I waypointed op4ctf_wonderland even though the bots cant play on them :P

I definatly like Op4ctf alot, the only problem is its impossible to find any servers running it so a bot would be very suitable.

Oh and I got a few more maps that will work with the bots in Op4CTF:(I downloaded them from Op4Central)

op4ctf_hairball - This is the easiest map on earth to waypoint. I could waypoint this map in my sleep. Oh and its well made too (made by a mapper from Gearbox)

op4ctf_tension - another great map. This one may be harder ( you may have to add a push button here waypoint but other than that it would be possible)

Botman you've got to add op4ctf support. Its way too laggy online and anywayz there no servers : (
You worry about the code ill waypoint all day for you (ive got no life ; )...............:-( wait...
:mad:
oh well

I'm working on it now.  Hopefully it will be in the next release (probably due out this coming weekend).  OpFor deathmatch is also pretty laggy even on fast machine with bots.  I'm just not overly impressed with OpFor as a "professional" MOD.
