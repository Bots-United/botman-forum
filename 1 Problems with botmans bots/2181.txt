Hi Botman,
i install botmaster and everything work fine good job man !
Bud i have probs with foxbot,when i try to add a foxbot for example "fox addbot 1 2",it wont join team 1 and not as sniper, it always use a random team and class!Hpb bot works fine,any idea why this happends?
It also would be nice if you can create something that BM5k supports multibot mapbot.cfg files,it would be much more easier to add bots, for example
2fortbot.cfg "hpb addbot 1 2,fox addbot 2 9"
however your bots kick ass and your a cool dude!

I'm not sure what the deal is with the FoxBot and BotMixer5000.  Check the readme.txt file with the FoxBot to make SURE that you have the addbot command correct (not all bots use the same format).

I have thought about adding a .cfg file for the BotMixer5000 where you can add commands to it but I don't have anyway to control what the bot DLL code does, so if there is a botmixer5000.cfg AND a bot.cfg file for a specific bot DLL, both of them would get executed causing more bots than you have wanted to be added.  There's simply no way for the BotMixer5000 to override what a bot DLL file does.  I think this would cause more confusion than it would help, but I may go ahead and create an empty botmixer5000 command file in the next version where you could add alias commands if you wanted to.

Hello Botman,
Well I've tryed up your BotMixer 5000 on CS.
It's really great ;) easy to install, uninstall, add new bot, reinstall, really cool.
But, I've a problem and a question.
The problem: 
- I use PODBot-2.5 and RealBot-ftr2.1 on CS (hlserver 1.1.0.7 & CS 1.1) PODBot is able to answer radio commands (when used alone without botmixer) but when botmixer is installed, no more answer to "my" radio commands (I said that because bots use them and react to bot radio commands) so It looks that bots use it but never respond to mine, they don't follow me anymore, etc ...

the question:
in liblist.gam 
if you edit it, there is a reference on the hl patch version (currently 1.1.0.7). why is it 1.1.0.4 in liblist.gam ? i changed it to 1.1.0.7, that's maybe why PODBot don't react to my radio commands anymore ?

thanks a lot for your work,
you botman and all the others.

I haven't looked at the POD bot radio command stuff, but if there is a special command that you have bound to keys to get them to follow you, you may have to change it.  For example, if I had a bot command called "followme" that was bound to the 'f' key.  When I pressed 'f' it would issue this command, the followme command would play the "Follow Me" sound and, at the same time, signal the nearest bot that I wanted to be followed.

With the BotMixer5000 you have to change the bot commands and add the alias that you set up in the botmixer5000.cfg file.  For example, the above 'f' key would now have to be bound to "pod followme", instead of just "followme".  If this is being done through a menu it can get even more complicated (or impossible).  If the menu commands are configurable (like they are in TFC), you can just change "followme" to "pod followme", but if the menu commands are hard coded into the bot DLL then you can't change them at all.

Again, I don't know enough about how POD works to tell you what to do to fix things.  Try asking on the POD bot forum to see if anyone there knows how to change this.

P.S. If you change things to work with BotMixer5000 then they WON'T work if you ever switch back to just POB bot alone, since the POD bot doesn't recognize the "pod" alias at the beginning of the command.

well it's the standard radio commands of CS
before the installation of botmixer, everything was fine. when I said via radio commands "follow me" bot answered "affirmative" or "negative"
It's a standard stuff of cs and podbot was able to hear my commands.
now that botmixer is installed, it's not working anymore. but bots still use it.
I could hear bot from my team saying " i'm in position" or "cover me" or any of the radio commands they are able to use.
I think I don't SHOUT enough :)

I was just wondering, how much different bots you could use in the same game.
why a such question ?
because I run an HlServer (full dedicated version) and if not using botmixer, I could play a game with up to 12 bots without any problems.
(podbot or realbot, I've not tryed joebot alone)
I tryed to install botmixer with podbot & realbot, it worked fine too.
I installed Joebot and yurk 3 different bots (4 of each to make 12 players) make the game lagging to hell. ping up to 200ms instead of 30ms !
and each time a bot get killed the ping goes down.
Did anyone reported the same thing ? 
is it because of botmixer ? because of JoeBot ? 3differents bots at the same time is too much ?
I use a PII-466 with 384Mb of ram with ultra ata-66, only one game started and no other programs (on win2k)

"is it because of botmixer ?"

Yes, it is, sort of.  Think of it this way...

Each bot DLL requires some amount of CPU time to search for entities (grenades, weapons, other players, radio commands, etc.)  Let's be generous and assume that each bot DLL uses EXACTLY the same amount of CPU time during each frame to do stuff (when in reality some will use less CPU time and some will use more).

Let's also assume that the time required by the bot DLL code to do stuff is X milliseconds.

Then if you run 1 bot DLL (with or without BotMixer5000), it will take X milliseconds per frame for each bot.  So 12 bots will take 12 * X milliseconds to do stuff.

Now let's assume that you run 2 different bots (using BotMixer5000).  Now BotMixer5000 will call each bot DLL code one after the other.  It will now take 2 * X milliseconds since you have twice as many bot DLLs doing stuff.

Now let's assume you have 3 different bots.  It will now take 3 * X milliseconds for the bot DLLs to do stuff.

The more bot DLLs you cycle through the more time is spent doing bot DLL stuff.  Since this time was available before for the engine you would be able to get high frame rates.  Now that all of this CPU time is being spent cycling through the bot DLL code you will have less CPU time for the engine and thus lower frame rates.

Just, FYI, the BotMixer5000 can handle up to 10 bot DLLs at the same time.  Your frame rate would probably be between 1 and 5 frames per second (just a rough guess) with this many bot DLLs loaded.  Also the bot DLLs require memory for code and data.  This memory is taken away from the memory that used to be available to the engine.  There will be more page swapping and, in extreme cases, you could actually start paging more stuff in and out of the hard disk.

The moral of the story is don't run more than 2 or 3 bots if you don't have a VERY fast CPU and video card.

In reply to gordons post, I have the same problem with fox bot, it seems to ignore your command and uses auto team and a random class no matter what you tell them to be. The only way I managed to get the bots to join the team and class I wanted them to be was to enter it before hand in the MAPNAME_bot.cfg or bot.cfg file (where MAPNAME would be the map you were going to play) in the maps directory using the standard "addbot X Y NAME". 

I also I have a problem with odd bot where it ignores the "odd addbot X Y" and only works if I use the standard "addbot X Y" in the console.

Hi 

Another awesome program indeed from the great BOTMAN.

Here's the error I'm getting everytime I load two different bot programs on one team in cs "NUM_FOR_EDICT : bad pointer". I'm using hl 1106 and cs v 1.1 . No problem on one  team having the same bots and another bot from the opposing team.  Any suggestion plz. 

I just wanna battle it out againts one pod and two boc on de-italian since pod has the great ability to go to the roof while boc is just so unpredictable on its navigation.

Reformat your hard disk.  Install Windows95 (or Windows98).  Install Half-Life.  Update to 1.1.0.7.  Install Firearms.  Ta-Da!  It works now!

reinstalling cs retail version 1 somehow fixed my promblem of loading more than two bots program on one team. wow, things are so complicated now that i really enjoy battling it out the same time with a boc, a real, a pod and one mighty freedombot.

can't wait for the next mb5ooo release which i hope would feature some nice gui for easy and fast configuring or whatever.

anyway to add-up to that posting about bots no longer obey when "follow me" is hit seems to be a real constant to most bots except bocbot which when approach and hit the "use" key the bot do follow you as obedient as a good buddy backing you up ready to catch some glory once you're out.
