When i try to compile Botman's source Code to HBP Bot theres coming a error '1 error found', i use Borland Make 5.0. when i've not installed borland C++ nothing happends when i type make in DOS. I try to use MingW32 but i dont' know how to do, and when i try to compile the HalfLife SDK SourceCode some folder don't exists, the Common folder is in the util directoru and two 'shared' folders don't exists,

To use MingW32 you must run the MingW32.bat batch file.  You MUST edit this batch file if you have not installed MingW32 in the C:\ directory.

If you get errors trying to build the SDK make sure of 2 things...

1) That you are building the Standard SDK (not the Full SDK).

2) That you are building SDK 2.0 (not SDK 1.0)
