Sorry if the topic name was a bit aggresive I just want to grab your attention 

Sorry...

Ok. Ive read the waypiont readme about placing sniper waypoints and .

RILP!

Instead of the bots sniping at their enemies, they would move in circles trying to go near again their waypoints.... hard to explain

sniper bots see enemies from afar,
then they yaw around 
and move again to their waypionts
then they get killed by me!

_________________________________
is it because they see multiple enemies?
(forget this question)

Maybe you just don't have very good waypoint placement.  If the sniper areas are narrow or difficult to get to, this can cause problems with them trying to get close enough to the waypoint to be considered touching it.

You might want to look on one of the waypoint websites (like Waypoint Warehouse) to see if someone has already made waypoints for the map you are playing.

Ehh?.?... I already checked if the waypoints are touching the wall and theyre not meaning they have a lot of space (or radius if count floyd calls them) the space aint narrow and I place them at the very center of the sniper towers.

again they do this when they see an enemy

Other suggestions: One of the bots will escort the one whose got the flag to the capture poiint

pleas read 
thanks for the attention

Expected answer:
HElll NOOOOOO!

You can e-mail me the .wpt file if you want (I don't need the .wp1, .wp2, etc. files, just the .wpt file).  I can't promise that I will fix anything even if it's not a waypoint file problem.  There are just some maps that the bots won't be able to play very well on no matter how good the waypoints are.  There are many things that they just don't have the code to understand.

Okay, I'll take a look this weekend and let you know if I notice anything strange.

I tried your waypoint file for BADLANDS this weekend and I didn't see any problems with snipers getting to sniper spots.

You had 4 or 5 sniper points around the building for each team (one on the cliff overlooking the front entrance, one in the window above the front entrance, one at the rear in the round turret room, one on a cliff overlooking the bottom back passage way and one just below that in the small room at the bottom of the ladder).

I spawned into the game on the blue team as a sniper and added sniper bots one at a time on the the blue team.  The bots would run toward a sniper point, get to it and stand there waiting for an enemy.  I restarted the game, joined the red team and added sniper bots one by one to the red team.  In both cases the bots were able to get to their sniper points with no problem.  The bots didn't go to the sniper point in the little room below the ladder until I shot a few of them off the ledge above it and forced them to climb the nearby rope (to the right) to get back up on the ledge.

I did notice that you have a dozen or so paths that are more than 400 units long.  If you turn on developer mode (-dev on the command line when running hl.exe) you will see error messages about waypoint paths being too long (more than 400 units).  These paths will be discarded, but they will still be drawn in the game leading you to believe that the bots will take that path.  They won't.

You'll need to write down the index number of the waypoints in the error message, then find those waypoints and remove the path that is over 400 units.  Add another waypoint midway between the first and second waypoint for this long path to create two shorter paths.

I also noticed that there are several paths that lead from one waypoint, through solid rock, to another waypoint.  These paths need to manually be removed.  Sometimes when adding paths, the engine traceline code doesn't detect solid surfaces properly and you have to manually remove paths between waypoints that aren't visually out in the clear.  Also it's a good idea to ALWAYS have the waypoints paths turned on during waypoint editing so that you know when a valid path has been created between waypoints (don't forget to check BOTH ways because sometimes a path will get created from A to B but not from B to A).  You can manually add paths between waypoints if the don't automatically get created, but it's best to remove that new waypoint, reposition yourself slightly and add it again to see if the paths are created properly this time.  This is because the bots will also use tracelines as they are trying to see if the next waypoint on the path is "reachable".  It might look clearly reachable to you, but to the bots (who have no eyes), it might look like it can't get to the next waypoint on the path (since the engine traceline indicated that the path was blocked).

You can turn on the waypoint paths using "pathwaypoint on" console command.
