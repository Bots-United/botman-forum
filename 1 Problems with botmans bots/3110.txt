i have retail hl and cs and have set up hpb bot to play dmc and tfc and hldm..but when i tried it for cs it did not work....i have hpb bot in 
sierra/half-life dir but i guess cs must go in 
sierra/counterstrike ...is that right..or is it 
sierra/counterstrike/cstrike....that is where the wad files and map dir are....no now i am thinking sierra/counterstrike is right he he ...anyone??
thanks!!

You would need to copy the HPB_bot folder to Sierra\CounterStrike (so it's Sierra\CounterStrike\HPB_bot).

But, I would strongly suggest that you use some other bot for Counter-Strike.  See my "Links" page for bots written specificly for Counter-Strike (since the HPB bot doesn't officially support CS).

The only DLL that the HPB bot should install is in the cstrike\dlls folder.  The file would be HPB_bot.dll.  You can remove this file if you want.  If it's anything else, you should probably leave it there.  :D

he he oh sorry i just noticed it is a dlls file...
not a dll....it is 325 kb...(in winword it is heaps of zeros etc if you open it up)...  but i know it was not there before because in that dir only 2 files...sierra/half-life/cstrike....i am pretty sure that it is the ash of hpb bots attempt to play cs.......
