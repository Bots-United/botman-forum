Hi,
   Just a quick question. I've got the HPB source template 3 file http://dl.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?planethalflife/botman/HPB_bot_template_3.zip

And I can't seem to compile it. What are the steps that need to be done to successfully compile it under linux using gcc?

I have previously played around with the sdk and can currently modify the source and compile hldm mod's so the system itself doesn't have a problem nor does the sdk that I have (2.1 i think).

The steps I have taken to try and compile this for linux are:

extract the tar ball (yes .. i got this far ;) )
cp the dlls/makefile_linux to makefile
tried a make. I get some util.h errors (see below)

gcc -Dstricmp=strcasecmp -Dstrcmpi=strcasecmp -m486 -O2 -w -I../engine -I../common -I../pm_shared -c bot.cpp -o bot.o
In file included from bot.cpp:10:
util.h:51: parse error before `.'
util.h: In function `void MethodName()':
util.h:90: parse error before string constant
util.h:90: syntax error before `void'
util.h:90: stray '\' in program
util.h: In function `void mapClassName(struct entvars_t *)':
util.h:91: confused by earlier errors, bailing out
make: *** [bot.o] Error 1

ok. So i thought that maybe it requires extra files from the sdk. 
So I copy the entire source tree to a new dir ie. bot1
I then copy the files that are different from the HPB over the top of those files in the bot1 dir. Change the MOD_DIR variable in the makefile and compile again. Same error.

I check out the location of the problem that the compiler complained about and it is the same in the original sdk source ie. "                ENGINE_FPRINTF(pf, "\"%s\" \"%d\"\n", szKeyName, iKeyValue)"

Anyone know what I am doing wrong?

Thanks

You'll need to make sure you have converted all CR/LF pairs to NL by doing one of two things.  Either use FTP in ASCII mode to transfer the files from a PC, or use dos2unix (or other similar utility) to convert the files from MS-DOS format to Linux format.

You'll need to make sure you're using gcc (egcs) compiler that can cleanly build the code.  I'm using RedHat 6.2 with gcc (egcs) version 2.91.66.  Other versions may or may not work.

Other than the above 2 things everything else is included in the HPB bot template source code zip file.  Nothing from the SDK is needed.  Just rename "makefile_linux" to "makefile" and run make to build the .so file.
