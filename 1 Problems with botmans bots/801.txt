Erm, is it me, or has botman been forgetting to :

1) Unban ip addresses after a while so most "good" people can get on
2) Put the nice stars in again(maybe change them to bots?)
3) Reply to my message(he did once, but never got back to me about the vgui)

Does anyone know the problem? I think its a coding problem, but i can't seem to get to botman to fix him.
