Does template #3 match release 1.4?  :-)

The HPB bot template #3 source code is pretty much the HPB bot Beta 4.2 release without any of the HPB bot's navigation code.  The weapon usage code hasn't changed much since then.  The waypoint editing code hasn't changed much since Beta 4.2 either.  The navigation code (which isn't included in the template source code) has changed very much from the Beta 4.2 release.

If you look at the HPB bot template source code (in the bot_navigate.cpp file) you will see that the navigation functions are only stubs.  You must fill in the code that you want to use to get the bot to navigate it's way through a level.  You can use many of the functions from the waypoint.cpp file to do this, but you pretty much have to understand how the waypoint.cpp functions work in order to make proper use out of them.

Rob, I tried to e-mail you but my message bounced back.  Did you see the update on my main page about this sentry gun bug in 1.4?
