mp_friendlyfire 0
put it in your listenserver.cfg, or your bot.cfg or your mapname_bot.cfg

That command is already in my listenserver.cfg. And it's not working.

I do have the # part of it, that makes sure the command don't work deleted.

Use the command mp_teamplay and change it to 21 for normal play. 2 makes friendlyfire on, and 0 makes a frag fest! :)
