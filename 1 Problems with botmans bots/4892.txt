This isnt really a problem with the bots since they've not been designed to do this....but i thought you guys would like to hear about something funny.

I was feeling a little adventurous since I now have my metamod capable HPB_bot binary (linux)....so I got svencoop 2.1 running on my BSD server (i'm a rebel, i know) to see if it would work....i installed metamod...hmm..works.....so i started enabling my plugins..tried the bots...hmm..that worked too.  So I get into the game and I use rcon and add a bot to the game....works again...I'm thinkin my luck must be really good.  So this bot spawns into the room.  This stupid bot didn't shoot at me like I expected, but it kept following me around.  It was up in my face and backing me into corners.......kinda funny to see a bot behaving like that.

I wonder if I could find a skin for a dog....maybe get a leash....we could have puppybot!!.....(maybe not)

ok...thats my story..
