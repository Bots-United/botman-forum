First if all, botman, I think that the 2.0 version is GREAT! Now I can waypoint all the remaining maps. Well anywyaz the only problem I have is that when I play Op4CTF with over 8 bots in game the lag soars. This may be because Gearbox/Valve's maps for Op4CTF are high on r_speeds in some areas, but maybe you could so something about it. Just thought you'd want to know!

It's not the bot code.  OpFor itself is VERY LAGGY.  Try playing it on an LAN game sometime.  Gearbox just does NOT impress me with their coding skills.  There's nothing I can do about OpFor being so slow.  That's one of the reasons I didn't want to do OpFor CTF.  The OpFor deathmatch is also VERY laggy.

I never knew Op4 WAS mulitplayer compatable. I thought it was only single player.
