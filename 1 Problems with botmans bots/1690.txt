Yes, you could do something like this.  You would have to implement some method to keep 2 bots from constantly sending things back and forth...

bot1: bot2 sucks!

bot2: bot1 is scum!

bot1: bot2 is a weasel!

bot2: bot1 sucks!

bot1: bot2 is a weasel!

bot2: bot1 sucks!

etc., etc., etc.

Hey BOTMAN i was thinking about the BOTs responding to players not the bots..
im running a bot server  with maxplayers set to 22 and 10 are bots, players really believe they are playing with real humans accept for the same bot chat coming back over and over..
i added more verses to the chat but doesnt really help after hours of playing..
if some how the bots could respond to certain set of keywords it would be more real with the bot chat.. other then that the 5 ping is allso a dead give away for the bots.It would be nice to some how have the bots show a fake higher ping upwards past 100.I know theres a fake ping setting for halflife but when set it not only sets your ping display but really sets the ping lag for it allso.:(

one more thing,
when i set all the bots for team 1

min_bots 12
max_bots 21

bot_chat_percent 10
bot_taunt_percent 20
bot_whine_percent 10

bot_logo_percent 40

bot_strafe_percent 10
bot_grenade_time 5
 
# wait for 3 seconds
pause 3

# change default bot skill level to 2
#botskill 1

min_bots 12
max_bots 21

bot_chat_percent 10
bot_taunt_percent 20
bot_whine_percent 10

bot_logo_percent 40

bot_strafe_percent 10
bot_grenade_time 20
addbot 1 1 DONT_PANIC! 1
addbot 1 2 TheGunner 1
addbot 1 2 Stimpy 1
addbot 1 2 FUBAR 1
addbot 1 2 (1)Player 1
addbot 1 2 SpamSpamSpamSpam 1
addbot 1 4 Kickin_ASCII 1
addbot 1 3 DeadManWalking 1
addbot 1 4 l33t_hax0r 1
addbot 1 6 Thor 1
addbot 1 9 RainMan 1
addbot 1 9 Moving_Target 1 
addbot 1 2 Player 1
addbot 1 2 ObiWan 1
addbot 1 2 xyzzy 1
addbot 1 1 Crash_N_Burn 1
addbot 1 4 Blinkenlichten 1
addbot 1 4 Hard_Core 1
addbot 1 6 J_Random_Hacker 1
addbot 1 9 Cardinal_Fang 1
addbot 1 9 Dead_Meat 1

and i start the server they all do what is set in the bot.cfg
but when the map changes they all join random teams and classes, i tried every way i could think of,like team balance and other settings to fix it but no luck..any ideas?

The Bots VS Spies
i think the bots have a disadvantage over humans  with spies.i think a bot should at least crowbar some one lurking behind them,the bots are sitting ducks for spies.anyone that is a spy can easily wipe out the bots by becoming a spy.
the spy can throw a gernade and wipe out the entire team of bots and the bots will stand there and do nothing while a spy is wiping them out.
there should at least be some sort of random attack on a spy from a bot to give a bot a simular chance that a human has..

I havent used the bot since the alpha version and WOW they have come a long ways.good work botman:)

"Hey BOTMAN i was thinking about the BOTs responding to players not the bots"

Bots should be treated just like other real players.  Someone coding this could prevent the endless spamming by stopping them from responding after 2 or 3 messages.

You can't set the ping time for bots to be anything other than 5ms.  The fake lag is something that is implemented client side (not server side).  Bots don't have a client and thus can't set a fake lag.

If you want to always force the bots to be on a specific team (or always use a specific class) you will have to create map specific bot.cfg files.  The reason for this is that different maps have different numbers of teams and different classes that are allowed.  The bots will randomly pick from the available teams and classes when a map change occurs.  If you want to force them to use a specific team or class you have to create a map specific bot.cfg for each map.  See the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file for instructions on creating a map specific bot.cfg file.

i reread the instructions and
i see what i was doing wrong with forcing the bots on the same team.i wasnt puting the 2fort_bot.cfg bot files in the maps folder.i had them in the tfc folder..
works great!! thanx
