Sorry for the long time before response! 

I saw this post already a week ago but I was on my other comp and forgot my password.

I havent released the bot yet, nor is a website up. The reason I dont have a website up is because Im not really sure if Im going to be serious about this. I might end up not making the bot.

But then again, flying bots would be pretty sweet......

If bots where made to fly, they wouldn't need the sv_gravity code!

sv_gravity -99 will send them to the moon...providing there is no ceiling on the map

Once I was on a server that held 24 and the admin put sv_gravity -200000.. shorty followed by sv_gravity 4000000 (I know this becasue if you look at the console it tells you what he changed the gravity to).... The effect of 24 people being smashed into the ground caused the server to crashed... hehe that taught him a leason 8)

Yeah NaughtyDog but there are a few things to remember.

(1. Wedge yurself somewhere so you don't go splat yurself.
(2. Make sure there isn't to many bots or you will crash your computer

Hey if you wann do it, do it. 15 bots probably won't crash it... but that depends on your computer.
