This was an OLD Bug! There was something in the combat code that made the bots shoot players with THIER flag, i.e. they thought they were the enemy becuase the thought they were carrying the team's flag!

I don't think that should be a problem with the latest version, What version of the HPB_Bot were you using?

Try dustbowl again by first reinstalling the latest version (by using remove.bat then install.bat)

Botman won't be able to fix it it the problem can't be reporoduced, so if it still continues maybe there might be something else causing it, i.e. OS, version of half-life? etc.

There may be some other bug that Kyle has run across.  It's been a few months since I've tested any of the reverse capture the flag maps.  It's possible that there's still a problem somewhere, but, as always, as much detail as possible will help to find and fix the problem (i.e. which map you are playing, how many bots on each team, which team were you on, what classes on your team attacked you, etc.).

Hope that helps.

Ummmmm, not much.  Does it happen EVERY time you grab the flag or did only happen just the one time and work fine all the rest of the time?

I just tried dustbowl myself with the latest version of the bot and I din't see any problems with bots shooting team flag carriers :-(

But I noticed some strange goings on in 2fort.. A soldier and an engineer were both spinning walking round in circles in the respawn room. When I just typed "waypoint load" nothing happened. But I used "waypoint save" then "waypoint load" and then they started moving again, strange :).. The bots still can't swim with me too on 2fort, dunno what the prob is there!!!

ok i think i found ou the problem its quite easy if it is the problem. I was playing around with older versions of HPB bot then reinstaled the newest version and it did not replace the HPB bot .dll file then i just had to replace it manualy (problay because it dident overwrite it).But everything is working fine now, thank you with all of your help Botman

Ah ha!  Unless it was a REALLY old version you can tell which is running based on the "welcome" message that says "HPB bot - www.planethalflife.com Version X.X" (where X.X is the version number).  Older versions may say "Beta X.X".  It'll only get displayed on the first map thats loaded, but you should be able to use this in the future to verify that you are running the most recent release.
