I have a voodoo3 3500tv card with the resolution at 1024x768 and video mode miniGL...when I first start a server I get about 75 fps...next I will load the bots but they dont seem to register the waypoints(they stand in one spot jumping and spinning)...but when I lower FPS they immediately go on about their business(seems the lower the FPS the better they follow waypoints)...can anyone tell me why this happens and how high can the frame rate can be without affecting the bots?

The frame rate effects how the bots behave because I am using the distance they have traveled since the last frame to determine if they are stuck or not (like if they have run up against a box that's in their way, but it's not high enough for them to detect it as a wall).

If the bots move a very small amount (or none at all) from one frame to the next then they think they are stuck and try jumping and turning around to get "unstuck".  If the frame rate is very high then the time between frames is very short.  In that very short amount of time bots can't travel very far.  Thus, they think that they are stuck because they haven't moved very far since the last frame.

The framerate on my Voodoo Banshee card at 800x600 is about 30-40 fps.  It's the only card I have to test with so I can't tell you how high the framerate can be before the bots start thinking they are stuck.  I do know that at 30 or 40 frames per second they behave properly.  If I had access to a faster video card (and faster PC) that gets around 100 frames per second I could probably fix this problem.  Until then you'll just have to force the framerate to a lower value.
