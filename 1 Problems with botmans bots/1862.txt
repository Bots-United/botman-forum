Subject: Bots "dancing" at start of round.

Sometimes, the bots will dance at the beginning of a round.  They stay at the spawn and kinda jiggle.  They won't move until they are shot or a player walks into them.

Is this a common problem?  If so what have I done wrong.  

Thanks,

Phil

I never seen this problem before with the HPB bot.  There used to be a problem with my code where bots would just stand in the spawn room and jump up and down alot.  This was a problem with the way I was handling really fast frame rates (>50 FPS).  This problem with frame rates should have been fixed.  If you have really high frame rates, you might try lowering the "fps_max" setting in your config.cfg file (in the MOD directory).  The default is 72 frames per second max.

If that doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the bot.  As a last resort, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling Half-Life.

Thanks for your speedy reply.  Actually, I'm running these bots on a dedicated server.  So I don't have config.cfg file. (is that correct?)  

I've experienced this with Linux, NT and Win2k based dedicated servers.  Sometimes a nearby spawn will also "start" the bot.

Also, if a "live" player spawns at the same time, the bots "start".  This is only a problem on the server when the bots join before the "live" players can.  

Is there some log file or cfg that might help to diagnose this?

Thanks,

You can modify "server.cfg" and put the "max_fps" setting in there.

No, there isn't really any kind of debugging or logging that will help to determine why you are having this problem.

I forgot to ask before, but what MOD and what map are you using?  Do you have waypoints for that map?

Hmm, I should have included this:
 
I'm playing CS and this seems to occur on all of the maps.  I think I've made waypoint files for all of the maps that I use.

Could this be a problem if the bot can't "see" the nearest waypoint?  Sometimes you have to shoot the bot to get it to move, if just walking up to it doesn't stop the dance.  Once moving, they will find a waypoint and move along its path.

thanks for your help.

For CS, I highly recommend the POD bot.  Botman kind of only made his bot work for CS because he wanted to show that it could be done. The POD bot buys weapons and takes multiple routes. They are also very configurable.
