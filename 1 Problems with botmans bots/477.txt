Finally, having the BOTs now running for over 24 hours, I've noticed that the Bot names which are chosen randomly work for about 3 maps, then start picking the same name from the list (1)Atillathenun-(5)Atillathenun with very little diversity.

Not a HUGE problem at all.  I'm still elated that they work at ALL!  ..and I wrote to Leon, BotMan, dripping with thanks. =)
