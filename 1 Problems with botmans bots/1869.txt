Hi,
I use HPB bot with Admin mod, i load HPB from metamod.ini file.
When i start a game, bots join - there is as many of them as i wrote to bot.cfg file.
My problem is that i CANT ADD MORE BOTS after the game started.
i tried addbot command but it doesnt work

Pawel.

You need to e-mail the Admin MOD or MetaMOD developers or post a message in the Admin MOD forum.  I would recommend SEARCHing the Admin MOD forum first before posting (unless you like getting flamed).

you need to create a new file named "metagame.ini"

Put "dlls\HPB_bot.dll" w\o quotes

Sry, i forgot. It's different now.

But that way should work

You also might not have enough memory.  See question #3 here...

So i upgraded my cpu and memory to 384mb ;-)
That heapsize does work but your computer wont like it one bit.
