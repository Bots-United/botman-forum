Subject: lose bots at map change

This issue is a little bit bigger problem then the no bots when starting the server. The server only restarts maybe once a week on average and is manually started by me. Course if it crashes it does restart automatically but it rarely crashes.

This bigger problem is that when the map changes sometimes I lose a bot. Run an online server with 4 bots and 12 maxplayers. I think what happens is that the bots are kicked at end of game, then before they rejoin the new map a real player "steals" their spot. I do not have the pause function enabled (commented out) so I think they join as fast as possible. 

Just wondering if I can prevent this. 9 internet players exceeds the bandwidth available to the game server. 

I realize this probably can't be prevented and can live with it. I have a few admins that monitor the server throughout the day. So if there is no way to fix or even decrease the odds of this happening I can live with it.

Hmmm, it's going to be difficult to force the bots to be added before human players when a map change occurs.  I can't think of any way to do this with the current HPB bot release.

I might be able to do something like the Admin MOD and reserve player slots just for bots.  From some of the feedback I've seen on the Admin MOD reserving slots, many people (who don't operate the server) don't like it much since Gamespy and the Half-Life server menu show 9 players with 12 slots available but they get booted from the server when they try to connect since the other 4 slots are all "reserved".

I'll look into adding this in the next release if it's not too difficult.

Or if there is a way to make them not leave the server in the first place that might fix the problem. Anyway for them to just rename themselves and change class and skill rather than kicking the old and adding the new?

Are you saying the admin mod actually holds empty slots for certain people? So if none of those players are active the server has less total players? That doesn't sound like it would be much fun.

Unfortunetly you have to kick the bots from the server when a map change occurs.  If the bot program doesn't do it, the Half-Life engine will.

With Admin MOD you can set up the config files so that a player slot is reserved for a specific IP address.  If the client is connecting from the correct IP address then it will let them in, otherwise, it sends that player a message saying that slot is reserved and kicks them off the server.  This allows server admins to always be able to connect to the server that they maintain.  Nothing worse than not being able to play on your own server!

hlds_ld allows me to connect to my server via a webpage or via ssh/telnet to my linuxbox. I can changemaps, kick people etc. That's how I get on my server when its full. I think hlds_ld is much like adminmod. I like that better than the idea of empty slots when I'm not arround.
