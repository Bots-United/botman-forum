I have hpb_bot 1.8a
I have installed as instuctions say.

When I run my HLDS (hlds -maxplayers 10 +map boot_camp) it says

hlds has coused an error in HPB_BOT.DLL. 
hlds will now close.

If you continue experiencing problems try restarting... yada yada yada

please help :(

The "maxplayers" is a server.cfg setting.  These types of setting need a "+" in front of them (not a "-").  Change the command line to...

hlds +maxplayers 10 +map boot_camp

...and see if that helps.

Thanks but no. :( if I start it with a + it has default (6) players maximum... and still gives same error

that line is how i have always started my server (in the pre-bot days ;))
