I can't waypoint any levels!  I can add/delete points, but I can't get into the pathwaypoint thing or the menu!  I turned waypoint on, but when I do 'pathwaypoint 1' and stuff, it doesn't do anything.

u must be getting mixed up with the pod bot!
in hpb_bot, to create or remove a path, the syntax is:

to create a path from a waypoint to another:

walk to the first waypoint and type:

pathwaypoint create1

then walk to the sencond waypoint and type:

pathwaypoint create2

--

This is done the same way for remove except you will use:

pathwaypoint remove1

and

pathwaypoint remove2

Look in the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder.  There is a file called "HPB_bot_waypoint.txt" that explains how to use the waypoint editing system included with the HPB bot.

thinkgeek.com sells a mug that says RTFM. I almost ordered it but decided on "WTF?" instead.
