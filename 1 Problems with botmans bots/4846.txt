Got a funny feeling this is going to be really lame question.
Is there a way that you can make the clients that connect to a server, download the model that the bot is using? 
For instance if I create a bot using the 'Homer' model, only clients that have already downloaded that model see the bot wearing the 'Homer' skin.
Is there a way that I could clients to download the Homer skin if they haven't already done so?

Love and peace

I don't think there's a way to force a client to download a player model.  The engine will substitute the Gordon model if a model another player is using doesn't exist on the client.

You CAN attempt to force downloads of models in the "models" folder by precaching the model when the map loads.  My Stripper2 metamod plugin can be used to precache abitrary models from the "models" folder.  Unfortunetly (fortunetly?) the player models are in a separate directory on their own.  Clients can also configure their machine to NOT download ANYTHING from the server (if they want to do this).

The problem with forcing a client to download a player model is that I (as the server operator) could create a player model that is nearly invisible (or completely invisible) and force you to download that and use that when I am playing. You couldn't see me, but I could see you.

One of the things that I always liked to do was to copy the'homer' player model into the 'skeleton' player model folder and rename homer.mdl to skeleton.mdl and that way anyone who thought they were playing as the skeleton (hard to see) were actually playing on my machine as homer (hard to miss)!  ;D

Nice one!
Is there a way then to protect the homer model, I mean don't allow anyone else to use this model (in effect reserving it for the Bot).
For some reason I find it really grating to have more than 1 homer running about. Although I may need therapy to get over this

Love and peace

No, there's no way to allow some players (bots) to use a player model and not let other players (humans) to use that model.

Okey dokey.  Completely unrelated question and I know this isn't the right place but hey, you know far more than I.  Do you know how stats programs work? I mean where do they get their data from? Does HL generate an increasing text file or something?

make a .res file for a map

ie. crossfire.res

put in it

/models/player/homer/homer.mdl

it will download for that person as long as its on the server in that folder
i think thats right
