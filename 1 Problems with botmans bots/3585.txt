Subject: Question of installing metamod (zipped version)

I have windows, and botman told me to get the zipped version of metamod. I want to be able to use Monster with the HPB_bot.

Now I am a TOTAL newbie at this and don't really know what I'm doing. I'm afraid of doing something wrong that could cause me to reinstall Half-Life, even my entire system. But I need help with this 1st thing in the monster readme file of installing metamod.

It says here;
"Copy the metamod.dll file to the MODs dlls folder (the default for Team
Fortress 1.5 is C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\tfc\dlls,"

I opened the metamod zipped version and see all of these files and directories. Where do I put these files? Or do I just worry about going into it's dll directory, and extracting metamod.dll into the TFC/dlls directory?

You can put them ANYWHERE you like, because YOU have to manually copy them to where they are supposed to go (by following the directions in the ReadMe.txt file).  You can unzip it to C:\ or C:\Program Files\metamod or C:\Stuff\Junk\Garbage\Temp\WhatTheHell\ or T:\X\Y_67cs5\zzm_de____4jd\f_f_f_f_f_f\whoooooo\, etc.

Sorry if I made you mad, botman. But the readme.txt file does not say anything on how to properly extract all the files. It just says to extract the metamod.dll file, nothing else.

If I'm only supposed to extract the file, then why are all of these other files here?

Please don't be mad at me. I'm TRYING to learn this. Give me a break, please. I am not as smart as everyone else that knows what their doing. What I need is step-by-step instructions.

No offence, but why did you act like that? I need help here. I need someone, ANYONE, who knows how to do this, and do it right the 1st time, that isn't snobbish. I'm sorry but you where. I just need help setting this up. I am NOT perfect! I wanted a polite answer and you did that.

Well, technically, botman is right... You can put the metamod.dll anywhere you want. Just ensure, after that, that you specify its path in the liblist.gam file for the MOD you intend to install it for.

I.e for TFC, I would put it in C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\tfc\dlls (replace C:\SIERRA\Half-Life by the path where you installed Half-Life, obviously). Then, I would fire up Notepad, and open the file C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\tfc\liblist.gam (or whatever path, you understood). And I would change the line that says : gamedll "dlls/tfc.dll" to gamedll "dlls/metamod.dll". Then I would drag my mouse over the "Save" button and I would click the mouse's left button with the second finger of my right hand ; then I would.... ok ok I stop it.

And btw, your computer won't burst in pieces if you go trial and error. That's a good way to learn, also.

I got it working. It wasn't easy, but I did go threw the readme, and found out I didn't need the zipped version of metamod, just the DLL. botman, I think you got confused when I said about the Monster Plugin. You probley thought I was talking about which download to get instead of Metamod.

I even created my 1st monster.cfg file for a map that I like playing on my Public, but Private Bot Server. It was alot of fun, EXPASUALLY when being able to have alittle 'target practice' with a hgrunt if I'm bored. And have a dang apache or a bigmomma appear right infront of the enemy flag carrior! LOL!

Great plugin, botman! Sorry I was alittle upset at you before. I'm over it now. Now that I got it working. I understand that you probley had a bad day, but you could be just a little bit more helpful and nicer. No offence. Your probally sick of people asking you questions, but as a wise man said; You create it, you got to support it and be prepared to answer alot of questions about it. Even newbies like me.

At LEAST I know how a computer works. I don't need it THAT simple. You know what I mean. :)
