I've updated one of my Front Line Force servers to version 1.2 (just released this week) and if I load the library for the HPB Bot the new weapons, secondary cap points and other various things cease to function.  
Is there a quick fix for this or do I have to wait for the next release of HPB Bot?  Man, I'm starting to miss those bots.
