To anyone, please.
 Before I downloaded HPBBot, I had the RealBot installed for CounterStrike... And after I removed RealBot and installed HPBBot, I get the SZ_Buffer error message as soon as a bot spawns in the map. How to fix this?
Thanks a lot.

Do you realize that the HPB bot doesn't offically support Counter-Strike?

I would recommend trying PODbot or JoeBot if you weren't happy with RealBot.  See my planethalflife.com/botman/links.shtmlLinks page for the URL of other bot sites.

Thanks!
 But the HPBBot worked better than RealBot, anyway... Thanks again.

Trust me, you want POD bot it rules.  The creator is going to be doing the AI for the counter strike single player game "condition zero" POD bot is the best for CS!!

Podbot is great, except for the fact that it doesn't have a LINUX version!
