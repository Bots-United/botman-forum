   Im trying to make your HPB bot compatible with my mod. I followed to instructions in your readme and it compiled fine, but everytime i type addbot the game crashes. Well is more when ever a bot joines the game because the .cfg addbot commands don't work either. Currently my mod has no new entities because it is in early alpha stages. Please help me. Bots would really make it easier to alpha test because i only have two testers and they aren't always available. No people reading can't alpha test ;) I put -dev mode on and it doesnt say anything about not being able to load any enteties! AAAAH! Plz help!

It would be MUCH easier to get the Bot Number 10 code working in your MOD that it would be to get the HPB bot code working.  Download the Bot Number 10 source code...

...and just drop these .cpp files into your SDK dlls directory and you're done.  You may have to wind up cutting-and-pasting stuff in client.cpp, game.cpp, multiplay_gamerules.cpp, player.cpp and player.h if you have modified stuff in these (which you probably have).
