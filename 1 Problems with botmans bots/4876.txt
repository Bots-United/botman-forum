If anyone has problems with HPB bot, I've taken the liberty of fixing the dll, zipping it, and put it on my server.  I've tested it, so it should work.

Any chance of this becoming an offical release (e.g. 3.1) with a Linux binary?

probably not.  

but then again, it's up to botman

I can't build a linux binary because I'm not very linux-savy, although I do have mandrake linux on my system.

It's fairly unstable, so I doubt it will ever be official

I probably won't be updating the HPB bot to work with Counter-Strike 1.6 since the HPB bot doesn't "offically" support Counter-Strike anyway.

Your best bet is to use one of the other Counter-Strike bots that have a Linux version available.

Michael,

Any chance of posting your binary to a geocities site or something?  I think your IP address changed and I can't download. (I run a windows server sometimes)

HPB_bot still works fine with the other mods under steam.

BotMan: 
First, I should thank you for an excellent program. I can only imagine the hours of hair pulling you put into it. Now, I understand counter-strike is not *officially* supported, but I have a question or two. HPB_bot works GREAT with my linux dedicated counter strike 1.6 server and steam. Let's face it the other server side bots people make for linux dedicated servers just suck ass, personally I would rather shoot and throw grenades at the walls. so let's just cut through the _____  and stop pretending now shall we? The only "problem" HPB_bot has that I can see that may or may not be counter-strike specific, and cannot be fixed without programming knowledge (as far as I know) is the MIN BOTS MAX BOTS, feature, setting or whatever you call it. If I have those set my server maxes out and fills with bots so no one else can join. And if I comment those out, and I just add "addbot" lines to HPB_bot.cfg, The first round that starts when the server is started, those bots do join and no more, but over time, they drop one by one until the server is empty again. I have no idea why. And if I change the map via rcon, the bots dont get loaded for the new map at all. So my question is, im not asking for more features or support but what are the chances that those few final things are going to get fixed? Because although again I say I dont know how to program, god how I wish I did, I hear other people saying how they would fix it and it sounds easy for someone who can program so I have an idea (could be DEAD wrong) that it would be fairly easy for you to just get those final few things fixed and drop a final binary on your website for the little guys like me that cant program. Whaddya say botman throw me a god damn bone. :) You dont have a different version of a bot that will work with cstrike do you? Im under the impression HPB was the only one that will work with cstrike. Anyway if all hope is lost in what I seek, what does anyone here recommend for a bot that will run on counter strike but server side, multiplayer like HPB. Not standalone windows crap, I wouldnt even bother. thanks.

"but what are the chances that those few final things are going to get fixed?"

Pretty much zero.  I just don't have the free time anymore to keep updating the projects on my website.  At some point, Valve will probably release a client update that breaks the HPB bot entirely and it's not likely that I will update it in the future to keep up with changes that Valve makes.

I only leave the website up because it's a good resource for people who are just getting started in Half-Life modding and I don't spend near as much time in this forum as I used to (you may or may not notice that I don't post as much especially in some of the longer threads).  I just don't have the time to spend reading through all the disucussions and I really don't have any free time to work on keeping my projects up to date with the latest Valve changes.

Sooner or later it happens with almost anything that's available on the Internet unless people are willing to hand over their projects to someone else who has the desire and time to keep things updated.  Since I released my source code, anyone else is free to update things to work with the latest engine changes, but I can't promise that anyone else won't break something or add in other features that you might not want.

Well sh*t, whoever it was that once said "honesty is the best policy." was right after all. I can appreciate that. I understand exactly what you are doing, I have you figured out. Although this is only currently one bug that would help me out, next month someone else will find a new one that they "need" fixed, and the month after again it will be someone else, then maybe 6 months after that.. Your just nipping it in the bud now because as you say you dont have time. I can understand that fully so thanks for being honest. I suppose now would be a good time to go to your website and grab that source code while I still can. Best case scenerio? I learn best by examples, and working with something I am interested in. And I love bots and AI. So maybe if I look at your code and start to hack at it I can begin the process of learning. I also know UNIX and computers in general very well so I suppose that is one hell of a good start. Worst case scenerio? I have a very popular website with a community of people who can code in all sorts of languages from web scripting in PHP to perl, and C++ maybe I can get someone to look at your code and hook me up and show me how to fix it. So I thank you for what time you did put into your projects, I am certain you helped a lot of people have software to enjoy, and also helped people get themselves started in coding. Take care.

Is it that you ain't haxoring around this source code already, Mike ? What the #@(< are you doing ?

I can help you finding your way out of the code if you want until you get these bugs fixed, but hey, you'll still have to do the syndicate minima, don't you think ?

/me kicks some butt ;D

Well since HPB bot and Pod Bot are based off each other maybe you will know what could be causing PodBot not to end a level, even though the entire side is all dead.
It displays something like "game was a draw" and plays a sample sounding like "Ground Troops".

Have you seen this error before.
This also happened before on 1.5 but not that oftern.

Oh yeah its running on a linux box.

I liked HPB on CS 1.5 but the only thing that put me off was that it wasnt made for CS and so it wouldnt buy any weapons.

Thanks in advance
Paul

Sure, almost certainly that's because Count didn't use FREE_PRIVATE() properly. Have a look in my RACC preview and see how I use FREE_PRIVATE() in BotCreate() and do exactly the same for PodBot. Disable all other calls.

Basically calling free() on something that has already been freed/not allocated yet is very nasty.

sorry about the above....i quoted the wrong post...

sorry for the double post :)

anyway...I think I could muck around in the source code looking for things to fix, but since i don't have a knowledge of bots in general (i just know enough C++ to get along), I can't really provide a very good fix.  

If anyone wants to point me to a good botting tutorial, i'll take a look at that, but until then, I most likely won't get the bots to be very stable....
