If you are talking about trying to get the HPB to use spray logos from the decals.wad file, you just need to make sure the lump names begin with "{__" or "__" (that's two underscores).

The bots will randomly pick from these decal names if they exist in the decals.wad file.

I noticed that sometimes the bots will spray a negative image of the logo.  Has anyone else seen this happen?
