We've been running an HL team-play server again (after a few years hiatus) for several months now.

We included HPB_Bot early on.  It really helped draw players to the server.

Over time, we backed-down the number of bots.  At one point we removed them entirely.  But, now we have a few loaded again - in case anybody wants to play during times when the server is usually empty.

We also run Stripper2.  We use that to strip-out some of the wierd/alien weapons and power-ups from the game.  We strip-out the Gauss/Tau, Egon, Hive-hand, Long-jump power-up, and Snarks.  While a few players have complained about that, most have been just thrilled about it.

In particular, we were getting tired of all the bunny-hoping and gauss-jumping, as well as getting shot through walls with the gauss.

Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks to BotMan.  HPB_Bot and Stripper2 have really made our server successful.

It's hard to say for sure (since www.theCLQ.com went off the air), but I think we've got the most popular HL Team-play server on the Internet right now.  I think there might a few other HL servers that get more play - but I believe they are all death-match.

PS: I'd still like to see a public released version of HPB_Bot that runs under metamod instead of the liblist.gam and/or command-line.  It's not really necessary - just a pet peeve of mine.
