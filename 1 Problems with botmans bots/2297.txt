I'm looking for a bot, ANY bot that will be able to be used on TFC running HL version 1016. If anyone can help, it'd be greatly appreciated 

Thanks

I e-mailed you the HPB bot Alpha 1 source code.  Note that there's MANY bugs in it.  Search the "Bot developer's discussions" for "bugs" to find the thread that descibed fixes for many of the early bugs.

unfortunatley, I think the HPB_Bot was built under the HL SDK 2. Which was about version 1106.

And the HPB_Bot was the first, third party bot,  for some MODs. Cos botmans a genius! :)
