I've tried everything to make it so that no bots are automatically loaded... I've even deleted the cfg file but it keeps automatically loading 6 bots at the beginning of each round... How do I stop this?

 Also... Is there a way to remove bots during gameplay? Thanks alot. :)

The bot.cfg file that you want to remove should be in the Half-Life MOD folder (for example Half-Life\cstrike or Half-Life\tfc).  Removing the bot.cfg file in the Half-Life\HPB_bot\cstrike or Half-Life\HPB_bot\tfc folder won't do anything.

You can manually remove a bot from the game the same way server admins remove players.  Pull down the console using the '~' key (you need to make sure "console" is "1.00000" in your config.cfg file for the console to be enabled).  Then use the command "kick" followed by the player name or you can use "kick # <num>" where <num> is the number of the player shown in the "status" command.  For example, if the bot was named "SpongeBob", you can remove the bot by entering...

kick "SpongeBob"

...on then console.  It's a good idea to get in th habit of using the double quotes around the name since some names may contain spaces or other "special" characters.

Or type "rcon users" in console, find the users ID# and kick them with "rcon kick #12" (12 being the an example ID #). This helps for players with strange characters in their name. If a person uses ~ in there name they cannot be kicked by their name as when you type the ~ symbol it closes your console.
