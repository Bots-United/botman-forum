I don't know if botman, Ares or anyone else has received or noticed this but it is becoming and increasing trend lately.

I got chattin to some guy called Hextor_Ruler-lol-
on my usual server last night and he said he had this bot supplement file for either Abot of HPB bot. He added that is makes the bots do "really cool things" so he said then, but you got to laugh really...
What the file actually dose is delete all bot whine from the whine file and replace it with weird comments about your mother and farther etc etc.

easily fixable, but very funny at the time.
Also a great practical joke, LOL.

Im gonna ask him for the file again, so I can analyse it, cause how did he ever manage to get a zip file to run an exe-del/rep to a specific file.
