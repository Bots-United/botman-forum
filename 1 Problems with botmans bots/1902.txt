I think that I've run into a mem leak problem on the new version of the hpb bot.

symptoms: after 15-25 minutes of play, in TFC, 9 bots and two human players, the game suddeny starts acting as if there was lag. the game starts stuttering, pauses of aprox .1 seconds every 2 seconds or so. as time goes on, the pause gets longer, and the delay lessens.

system: Tbirg 1Ghz, 256MB ram 32MB Savage4+

any ideas?
ICQ or E_mail me!, lemee know!

There should be nothing to cause this after a specific 'time'. The only thing I can think of that may be causing it is you OS or a task scheduler, i.e. If you have any tasks to schedule 15 - 20 minutes while idle or not it will run, like virus scanners, scan disks etc ...
Other than that I can't think of anything related to the bot, Only botman will know that one!

I ran TFC overnight switching maps every 20 minutes and didn't notice anything unusual when I went back to the game in the morning.  There was a Half-Life engine memory leak for fake clients (bots) before the 1.1.0.6 update came out, but that problem was fixed in both the Win32 and Linux server code.

Like cheesemonster said, if you've got other applications running (even stuff minimized in the system tray, try shutting them down and see if the problem persists).

Run Dr.Watson then save the crash log.  E-mail me the crash log and I can tell you what's causing the problem.  P.S. if it's not crashing in HPB_bot.dll then you might have Windows drivers or DLL problems and may have to reinstall Half-Life or Windows.

For what it's worth, i just downloaded DMC last night & installed the HPB & played 4 maps at 20mins starting from the 1st map & had No Problems at all. But i also reinstalled my Half-Life about a week ago because Everything was crashing.. >:-(( 
Why does Half-Life have to be such a pain!?!
Maybe these new patches will help things.

have you tried playing after a clean boot?
Windows 98 used to take up 98% memory after one game or after my computer being on for more than 2 hours.  So I upgraded to Win2000 and play some real enjoyable games!
I seem to always beat them on those conc maps though ;-)
How about u cheesy?

I had this problem once. Your right about the mem leak but for me, it wasn't anything half-life related. Get a memory measurement program like memturbo and see if you are actually having these problems even when your using Word or something. I found that my RAM was 99% used more often then not even during idle times. It was horrible! ANY game I played would lag after about 10 or 15 minutes. I have no solution for it. Its probably some program that your not even aware of. I ended up installing another OS.

The problem might be your Virtual Memory. you problay should have it set to 320 on both min ans max for s system with 128 megs of ram.
