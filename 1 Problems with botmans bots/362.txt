I have been having fun adding bots of my own choosing every since I have been using your bots, I like to use the same group of bots every map.  I also like them to be the same class every time a level changes the bots still have the names i gave them but they are all random classes and the teams are like 5 on 9!  =( the folliwing is an exact example of how i have been doing it.   
 

addbot 1 6 [Pizza]Officer_Doofy 1
addbot 2 6 Player 1
addbot 1 3 snarf 1
addbot 2 4 Spammy 1
addbot 1 2 Silent_Scope 1
addbot 2 3 Andy 1
addbot 1 4 Ricky_Retardo 1 
addbot 2 3 Radiskull 1
addbot 1 7 To@sty 1
addbot 2 2 Mr_Headshot 1
addbot 1 2 fornicatus 1
addbot 2 8 stabby 1
addbot 1 5 Erotic_Spatula 1

why will this not work anymore?

Because with some maps supporting some classes and other maps supporting other classes (with different teams not necessarily having the same classes), you don't know ahead of time which classes will be valid for all maps that are in the mapcycle.txt file.

For example, let's say the first map you play is PULL (team 1 is only civilian, team 2 is only snipers), then you switch to SNIPRWAR (both teams are only sniper), then you switch to 2FORT (no limits on classes on either team).  If the classes stay the same then no bots will join team 1 properly on the second map (because they are all trying to civilians again).  Even if I keep the original class and use that in subsequent maps, if possible, or chose something else if not.  By the time you've switched to 2FORT all the bots on the RED team will be snipers (because that's what they were originally) and the game will be unbalanced.

The same thing happens with bots choosing the same team all the time.  If you start with a map with 2 teams, then switch to a map with 3 or 4 teams, there won't be anybody on the 3rd or 4th team.

The only method that I could come up with that prevents these types of problems is to let them randomly choose the teams and classes at the start of each new map.  You can control what they use in the first map (and if you play ONLY that map then everything is like it was before), but when a map change occurs they will randomly select the team and class.  Sorry.

One of the things I need to fix is making things so that they don't make the teams so lopsided.  Sometimes all of the bots will join the same team and there won't be ANY players on the other team(s).  I'll fix this problem in a future release.

Thats cool, i see what you are saying, i knew had to have done it for a good reason. The way i got around the class problem before was just to make seperate bot.cfg files with different bots for different types of maps and then I would also have seperate map cycles for each type of map. It is fun though to be able to mix up the cycle with different types of maps i guess, but what a price to have to pay.  I guess i am probably in the minority though as for not liking the way it is now, i am sure  most people aren't as anal about having the exact bots they want in there as i, but to me, the way things are now, spies, engies, and even medics to some degree are no fun espeially the engie, because all he does is shoot that darn railgun.  I must say that i am very impressed with the HPB_bot, they have already come a long way.  I can't wait till we see some sg's and the medikit in action.  =)
