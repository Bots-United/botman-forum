I am running hlds_l on Redhat 7. I added a remote admin and map voting proggy a while back (hlds_ld) and then just yesterday added HPB_bot (latest version). Everything worked fine at first (this is an internet server, not lan). Today I learned there was a new version of hlds_ld out so I installed it and now the bots won't talk or chat after they are killed. I can't figure out why either. I tried the ./Remove and ./Install to try to fix it but to no avail. Any suggestions?

Do they chat without the hlds_ld installed?

Dont know never tried. But they did chat once with both installed as I stated in my last message. I am going to work on it more tonight to see what I can get. Will probably reinstall everything and then install in this order as that what worked once: 1. hlds_l 2. hlds_ld 3. HPB_bot

Unless anyone has any ideas. I am wondering if some of the files that are updated from each program interfere with each other. Also, when I remove the bot program are any files left behind? 

Sure was nice when it worked right though. Remote admin via website, map voting, bots and internet players. Especially since my dsl only supports 8 remote internet players on its limited bandwidth. Adding in 4 bots really makes the server better.

"I am wondering if some of the files that are updated from each program interfere with each other."

That's why I asked if it worked without hlds_ld.  hlds_ld and HPB bot both probably take over the liblist.gam file and only 1 DLL would be loaded (I'm surprised the bots even worked at all if hlds_ld is installed after the HPB bot).

Alfred's ADMIN MOD allows you to set up a list of DLL to load instead of just the MOD DLL.  I don't know if hlds_ld has the same feature or not.  If not, you won't be able to run both hlds_ld and HPB bot.

First time everything worked fine. I installed hlds_l first, then hlds_ld v. 1.27b then HPB_bot. Everything worked even chat. Then I installed the new hlds_ld 1.31 and still worked but no bot chat. So now I have reinstalled everything in this order hlds_l - hlds_ld - HPB_bot and still no chat. Going to look into it more tomorrow as its quiting time. Why mess with this on my own time when I can get paid to do it, besides I am up for some fraggin ;o)

I might experiment with going back to version 1.27b of hlds_ld to see if chat works again with bots. If so I guess next step is to talk to hlds_ld guy to see what changed that might affect this.

Sorry I am not complaining to you. You wrote a fine program. I realize it's not your or the hlds_ld guys job to help me get both working together. Hell, I'm surprised I got this much working. I'm just disappointed is all. It sounded really cool to have both these programs working. I should just be happy that I have this much working after only one day of fiddling with it.

If you insterested, you can get info on our server at http://tf.bs-linux.com including current game statistics (the hlds_ld thang) and find the server addy. Click stats when you get there. You'll see your bots on the list :o)

Kevin,

Server is on dynamic IP so it changes. Best thing is to go to http://tf.bs-linux.com and click "stats" to get current IP. Thats one of the reasons I use hlds_ld is so my friends can easily find the server. Well also so I can kick someone out if its full and I wanna play :o)

I should start by saying I am not at home so my previous statement about no bot chat was based on watching the server remotely through hlds_ld and by checking logs. Apparently I was wrong all along or something got fixed without me knowing (boy i feel st00pid). Anyway, just got off the phone with the wife and she is playing now and bots are chatting. DOH! 

Sorry guys. Everything works fine, or at least it does now.

Just as a follow up.

I have verified that the bots are chatting. For some reason some logs (ie-hlds_ld logs) are not picking up their communication. 

Conclusion, hlds_ld and HPB_bot on linux are compatible.

I hope you don't mind if I link back to your site from mine. http://tf.bs-linux.com

That's fine with me.  I was going to create a web page on my site that listed IP addresses of dedicated servers (or listenservers) that ran bots.  I posted a news item about this many months ago and only received e-mail from 2 or 3 people.  Despite having the Linux and dedicated server support in the HPB bot very few server admins seem to want to run bots on the server.  I would think that for servers with very few visitors having a few bots running on it would encourage other people to join the server (since they can't tell if there are bots or humans playing on it until well after the join the game).  But I guess some server admins think people will refuse to play on a server that runs bots because they figure people don't join an Internet server to play against stupid bots when they can do that just a easily (and with less lag) from home.

Well your welcome to list my server but better to list the url as my ip is dynamic. It changes every other Thursday. 

I found your bots a great addition to an internet server. Previously mine was a 8 person server due to upload max speed of 272k. This is even a little taxing on my bandwidth unless one or better yet two people play from inside my lan. Some people have complained about having bots on the server but usually agree when I explain. We can only have 4 interenet players per team. Why not have 4 internet players and 2 bots per team. I set it up so that it's fair. For example if there is a level 1 hwguy on one team then there is the same class and skill level on the other team. Neither team has advantage or disadvantage. 

It also helps fill up my server much faster. Normally it can take some time to get a game going if the server empties out. Yesterday I no more than started the server again (after reinstalling everything) and within 3 minutes it was full. 

Oh and btw, you'd be surprised how many people play with the bots for more than an hour and still think their real people. :o)
