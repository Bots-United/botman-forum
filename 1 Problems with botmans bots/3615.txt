Hello

I'm running HL-TFC (with mod NeoTF), AdminMod (inc. Metamod), HL-Guard and latest Botman bots on a Suse 7.2 linux box.
Without any human players and botman bots the cpu load of the server is something about 5 % on a Celeron 1200. With only 4 bots the CPU load is something about 30 % (!), it slows sown the complete server.

Is this CPU load with 4 Bots normal ?

Thx in advance
Tobias

That sounds about normal.  With a 800 Mhz P4, I was able to add about 10-12 bots until the PC maxed out and the frame rate started to drop down below 20FPS.  With a 1.3Ghz P4, I was able to run about 20 bots before the frame rate fell below 20FPS.

Different machines will show different loads with the same number of bots.  It depends which operating system you are running, how much RAM you have, what other processes are running on that machine, what type of disk controller you have (SCSI vs. IDE), how fast your disk drives are, etc.  There's too many factors to say "This is what you should have...".

I got about 25 bots when it comes to my normal 'public' bot server on weekdays. (actually it's private) Anyway my lag is alittle high. It can go from 3 to about 35, and I'm using a P4 1.6GB Computer with Windows XP.

I forgot to also mention I have bots named "botman", "Cheesemonster", and "Grubber". ;)

Why doesn't it surprise me that the person that openly admits to using apaches to cheat by killing people running with the flag.. (on another post.. but in the signature block even)
 
Would tell a developer, on his own board, that he has a bot named after him that he kills?

No points for intellect.

Oh and just for a baseline, I use a 1.2Ghz AMD with 386Mb of SDRAM...

It's running right now in the background (with 33 admin_mod plugins loaded, 3 metamod plugins, 6 bots and 6 players right now) and spiking up to 3% CPU at times (with a bunch of spamming going on).  Right now I'm at 99% idle.  So if you're using more than 5% on a 1.2 something probably isn't configured correctly.  My Firewall takes more resources than HPB_bot does :)
