It actually does work, but not fully, or even well.

Just search for topics posted in by me. It finds only 2, and i have posted in many more topics than that.

Yeah, the search is kind of quirky.  If you are searching for multiple keywords you need to separate them with commas (and leave out the spaces).

Make SURE you click on the little radio button next to the type of search you want to do.  Just typing in keywords DOES NOT mean it will do a keyword search.
