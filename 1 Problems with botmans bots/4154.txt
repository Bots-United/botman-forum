Subject: Bot Chat Reload?

I was wondering how the bot chat file loads. Does it load at every map change? I'm assuming no, that it loads at server start and thats it. 

I recently mentioned my "bot randomizer" that I've written (not exactly a complex program more of a script that replaces the bot configs on a per map basis). Anyway in a struggle to think of LOTS of bot names I resorted to TV shows. One of which being the HoneyMooners. So I was thinking it would be really cool to randomize the bot chat too. For example when my "HoneyMooner" bots are on have a line in the chat for "One of these days $PLAYERNAMEHERE, POW!" Some of you youngens may not get the reference here but I know botman will ;)

Is there a way I can force bot chat to reload at every map change?

You could download botmans HPB_Bot source and find out how he created the map specific bot config files. They would load according to the map being played :)

You are correct.  The bot chat .txt file is loaded once, when the server is first started.  Any changes made to this file while the server is running will not take effect until the server is shutdown and restarted.
