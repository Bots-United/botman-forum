I wanted to mess around with the admin mod before installing on our server.  How do you make it work with the HPB bot? Grubber, i am sure you know the answer, right?

Go to the "help" section on the www.adminmod.org/Admin MOD site and download the "Help Guide".  There's a section under "Configuration" called "How to Use Bots with MetaMod".

If you do have any problems with MetaMod [Pizza], i'm really not sure i could help ya there. Cuz i never installed that yet. If there Help guide don't work, Browse their message board, usually the question you might have could have been answered oh maybe 10 or 15 times already..? LOL! It's a wealth of information there.. 

Maybe i'll try and install it sometime soon? 
Oh yeah, i want to check out your server! But i don't know how to get there. Do you know if i could put it in a batch file? Or do you know a small launcher program?

I am sure that some people can make admin mod work with bots, i know that with my comp and winbloze, it was not a good mixture.  You would think that their board would be helpful, I didn't find it to be.  I wasn't able to get through one map change without it crashing.  Right back to windows without an error at that.  I ended up having to reinstall half life last night.  It may have been something in my hardware, i dunno?  I think i had most of the variables set ok, i dunno.  I am sure there are a million people that have no problems with it, i am not one of them though. I have read that half life is sensitive to overclocking, I have all my stuff overlclocked, maybe that is the problem.  Well, no matter, i just thought i would give it a look.
to get to the server you can just go into console and type
 
connect 207.190.197.70:27015

or you can download gamespy 3d at 
http://www.gamespy.com/

or you can add that ip to your favorites in the browser thing that comes with half life.  Look forward to seeing you on there sometime.

Cool! I didn't know that you could do that from the console.. Excellent! 
As for gamespy i know about it but wasn't what i had in mind. What i was looking for was just maybe a small simple program that you could put the server's ip in and then launch TFC.. No matter, you've answered my question with something i never knew.. Thanks! ;)

I'm pretty sure if you make a shortcut on your desktop that points to c:\serria\halflife\hl -connect XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:XXXXX

replaceing the X's with your fav server then you can double click it to join...

not quite what you were asking for but it may suit your needs...

ingamespy you can go to your UNBOUND section and press insert to insert and IP address of your favorate servers to keep as a seperate list
