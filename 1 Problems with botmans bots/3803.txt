First you need to make sure metamod is running properly (if it wasn't already installed before).  Look for the metamod startup message when the server starts (see the Monster ReadMe.txt for details).

Then, if metamod is starting properly, you need to make sure the Monster plugin DLL is located in the MOD's "dlls" folder (i.e. Half-Life\cstrike\dlls) and make sure you've edited the metamod.ini file to include the Monster plugin DLL (again, see the Monster ReadMe.txt file for details).

You should also post more information about WHAT is not working properly.  I can't help you if you don't tell me what IS working and what IS NOT working (and you should provide any error messages or warnings that you see).

botman, you might not know yet that with the new HL Addon Standard that is applying since metamod 1.13 and the corresponding AdminMod versions, the files are not the same.

1- the DLLs for the addon have to be put in base_game_dir/mod_dir/addons/addon_name/dlls. e.g for metamod, in his case, C:\SIERRA\Counter-Strike\cstrike\addons\metamod\dlls\metamod.dll.
2- the config files for each addon has to be put in base_game_dir/mod_dir/addons/addon_name. e.g in his case, the classical metamod.ini is now relocated to C:\SIERRA\Counter-Strike\cstrike\addons\metamod\plugins.ini (note the name)
3- monster being an addon too, it has to be put in C:\SIERRA\Counter-Strike\cstrike\addons\monster (and NOT metamod\monster nor metamod\dlls if you follow the orthodox way !!)

Personally I dislike this standard since it places on the same line metamod and its plugins, adminmod and its plugins, not taking in account the hierarchy of things. Anyway, this is almost always confusing people. Read http://www.unitedadmins.com/info_addon_dev_standards.aspx
