Hi! i got the CS Retail with HL DM installed and hpb bot doesnt work. There must be some problems with the directories cause for all other mods the bot is working (Oppfor, dmc,holywars...). The bot installed everything in dir valve but but hldm is in dir hldm. So the result is that no bot is available ( its not an waypoint problem). Please help me!

Extract the HpbBot zip onto the folder which HAS the Valve folder in it. (don't extract it to the valve folder). Go into the folder that you extracted the Hpb_bot to, now goto the "valve" folder. Double click on "install.bat" (or remove.bat and then install.bat)

I installed CS Retail at E:\Counter-Strike. The Valve folder is at E:\Counter-Strike\valve hbp bot is at E:\Counter-Strike\hpb_bot
It is allright. I can install it and it says erverything is ok but in play there´s no bot available. Even the commands like addbot are unknown. In other mods hbp bot is working fine. It must be a problem because of cs retail.

I don't have the retail version of Counter-Strike.  From your description, Half-Life deathmatch is in the "hldm" folder instead of in the "valve" folder.

The HPB bot code will ONLY reconize Half-Life deathmatch if is it in the "valve" folder.  This is HARD CODED into the HPB bot code and even if you copy the files you needed into the correct folders ("hldm"), it still won't work since the HPB bot uses the folder name to figure out which MOD is currently running (and it doesn't know anything about any "hldm" MOD).

I don't understand which MOD do you want to add bots in, standard Half-Life's deathmatch, or Deathmatch Classic ?

Anyway, what you could do is rebuild the bot DLL with the correct path to the good bot DLL to load. Look in h_export.cpp for such stuff.

Good luck.

I want to start bots in Standard HL.
But the CS Retail Version seems to be different form the retail HL version.
Are u sure that there is only one place where i have to change the path? The Problem is i dont know waht botman needs from the dir valve (from the hl retail) which in the retail of cs is in the dir hldm.

With any version of Half-Life based game you have, two paths are important:

- The GAME path is the path where you have your game installed (f.ex. C:\SIERRA\Half-Life). That's the path where the engine DLLs are.
- The MOD path is the sub-path where your MOD is installed (f.ex. (gamepath)\valve or (gamepath)\cstrike), where your MOD DLL is.

Botman's HPB tries to locate the Half-Life MOD DLL in a MOD path called "valve". If this one is different in the retail version of Counter-Strike, you need to fix the path by hand in the code and rebuild the bot. Also check sure that the liblist.gam file's 'gamedll' field points at the correct location.
