Valve's response to video problems is to make SURE that you have the latest video drivers from the manufacturer of the card.  If you haven't checked in the last 3 or 4 months, you might visit the website of the manufacturer and see if a newer video driver is available.

even if that card will let you go into opengl or direct 3d you are probably still better performance wise in software mode with a card like that

I got a Voodoo3!
Only game i play is TFC really, and that runs smoothly at 1024x768.

Seem to get a blur effect though when i turn around quickly!
This happen to any other Voodoo3 users?
Is there a solution?

First, get the latest drivers from ATI
then run at 640x480 in OPENGL!!!

I used to have an ATI Rage Pro 8MB that did that in D3D; OpenGl fixed it

I have never had that problem!  When I use standard OpenGL it runs fine at 1024x768
The 1 point why I use Standard OpenGL is I can see through water clear! on any map.
Don't know if there's any solution to that blur effect.

What's your PC specs?
CPU?
SPEED?
MEMORY?
HARD DRIVE SPEED? RPM's?
