Click on the actual name of the map (on the left coloumn) If it is blue (a hyperlink) then click on it and it should have a link to a download site or a direct download! However, if the map name is yellow then I couldn't find that map so it isn't a hyperlink!

Cheesy how come I can't download from your site? Every time I click download a little box comes up asking me for a user name and password or something. It kinda sucks and I dunno how to fix it.
