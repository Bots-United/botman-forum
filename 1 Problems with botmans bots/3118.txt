When I'm playing TFC. And bots are killing eachother, you see a small icon of the gun that the killer used to kill. Anyway, the killed bot's name shows up infront of the icon, but it's missing a letter.

What I mean is this for example;

This is what it normally should do. The arrow thingy is the icon of the gun. Say like a headshot.
TheHulk -------> [spud]MrPotatoHead

But it does this instead.
TheHulk -------> [spud]MrPotatoHea 

It leaves off the "d" of the killed bot. Why is this happening? :(

It even does it on my name if I'm killed. It also does it if a bot kills himself. This isn't a problem, just annoying.

Could this just be a problem with my video card? I have a SiS 9000. Not something you see everyday.

I haven't ever noticed this problem on my machine.  Perhaps the bot names are longer than can be displayed on the screen.  Try shorting the name by editing the HPB_bot_names.txt file.  Try useing short names like "Bob", "Mike", "Jim", etc.

I have done that. I have several 4 letter names and the last letter keeps disappearing. I also have a few 3 letter names and their last letters are disappearing as well.

I tried setting my video display, thinking that I probley have the game screen past the monitor. It's below it, and still doing it.

This is a new computer that it's running off of, a HP. 1.6GB, 225MG of ram, 32MG Graphics Card. Windows XP Home Edition, and a Voodoo 2 card that will not work because the drivers are not digitally signed. So I'm stuck. The sky looks like where all fighting in a box. I paid $700 for the system, and I feel like I got cheated.

And on top of it, 3DFX will not provide support anymore for their cards and drivers.

To fix the skyboxes you'll need to extract all the skymap textures from the pak0.pak file.

Download pakexplorer (use www.google.com to find it) or some other Quake pak viewer utility and extract the sky .bmp and/or .tga files from the gfx\env directory in the .pak file to the save directory inside the MOD directory (i.e. tfc\gfx\env\*.tga).

It fixed that problem. But it didn't fix the bot names going off screen problem.

;D;D;D;D;D

I fixed it! :)

All I did was set my video mode to Direct3D, and BOOM! Now it's showing the ENTIRE name of the killed bot!!! 8)
