Because of those bots, destroying my sentury, as SOON as I get it built!

I said ALOT of bad words to them everytime, but they never reply. But I can just hear them laughing at my pitiful ways of trying to defend my base, without getting killed!

I try to be better then those bots. Most the time I get a higher score then my own team. But, some levels, I kinda stink at and I need the use of a sentury to back me up. Expasually when the ENTIRE enemy team are all HWGuys!

I thought about that. But, I don't think it'll make the HWGuys any worser. Cause I already have it set to 4.

Than put it on "botdontshoot 1" in the console.

Off the subject a little, I figured out how to get weapons from other classes (for instance, being a Engineer and carrying a chaingun).
I had been trying to figure it out before by typing in "give weapon_ac" but it turns out, all the weapon commands are like this "give tf_weapon_ac". :) Happy cheating.

Doy! I didn't know that! I was doing it like: give_tf_weapon_weaponname No WONDER why it didn't work!

I wonder if it also works for medikits, and ammo. Like: give tf_item_medikit 

You never know when you need it, right then & there!

I believe alpha means the same thing as beta. Alpha probley means "1st issue of program", or something like that. We all know what beta means.

I know about the other weapons. I gave the Assault Cannon as an example.

Here is the full list of commands;

give tf_weapon_ac

give tf_weapon_medkit

give tf_weapon_rpg

give tf_weapon_nailgun

give tf_weapon_gl

give tf_weapon_knife

give tf_weapon_superng

give tf_weapon_pl

give tf_weapon_tranq

give tf_weapon_flamethrower

give tf_weapon_crowbar

give tf_weapon_shotgun

I probably forgot some, oh well.

These cheats are very usefull if playing as the Hunted in Hunted maps if sv_cheats is set to 1. I was playing the bots on the huntedas the Hunted and I was carrying an RPG and a sniper rifle :D

NOTE TO MOD AUTHORS: Add lots of fun cheats. Dont add lam3r cheats like in CS, but stuff like Big head mode, new weapons, etc.

o ya, and is there any way in TFC to cheat to get ammo? 

P.S. i like to be an engy, build a sg, and since the bots now try to kill the sg's i get a rpg so me and my sg can blow them up before they can blow it up. [SM];)[/sm]

I wish their was a way you can just say "DIE!" And ALL the enemy bots will die off, before they get to your sentury.

But it's not gona happen!

12/03/00 at 19:58:31  Reply by: NaughtyDog (naughtydog_21@yahoo.com)

here is what each one does

1.spawns sparks where you are standing(bind a key and it looks like your a malfuntioning robot)
2.spawns turret like in the respawn rooms of 2fort wherever you standing(this will shoot at any team)
3.this just creates some weird orbs wherever your standing
4.spawns a smoke grenade wherever you are standing
5.same as #2 but little different

remember "sv_cheats" have to be set at "1" to work

I have no clue what the cheats are for ammo. I tried my best to find out but couldnt manage.

I wish there was a way to get big head mode in TFC, that would be awesome (Im a terrific sniper, so bigger heads would be nice 4 me).

There Is a way to do that, In THE CS real bot there is a command where it kills all the bots, If botman wanted to he could do it!

I don't know what it is, but ever since I had to uninstall the HBP_Bots and the reinstall em, they have show a marked improvmet, the wine and the fact they follow and effectivly use the waypoints makes seem even more human.

I think the bots are developing an AI, I swear one of em recognised that there was a sg just round the corner and throw a gren and so destroyed it. However this only makes them more of a challenge to play against, adding to the fun.
