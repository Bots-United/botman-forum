AHHH! i was playing a LAN game with bots at my freinds house. He was sniping on 2FORT and I was a spy on the opp. team. I was disguised as a enemy scout and just kept jumping, so he would think I was a bot, he didnt see me and a HW bot mini gun me to death!!! The spy is useless now with bots because the bots know that u r a spy even if u r disguised.  Will this problem be fixed because playing as a spy 1 vs 31 bots is FUN!

I've been tweaking with Botman's code, I have a version where the spy's disguise works as one would expect, with enemies seeing you as a friend and friends seeing you as an enemy when disguised.
