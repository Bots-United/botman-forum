Me and my nephew were playing a lan game and we had teams set for grunt;barney .. Me & my nephew were on team grunt, we got through 2 map changes when 3rd map loaded team barney changed to team scientist and niether team was shooting anymore.
Oh, it was DM.. Not CTF.

All the bots may have thought that they were all in the same team.

Must be like that same bug with the Fassn?
I didn't think it affected the others though too.
Maybe next time we could switch the teams to something different. Yup, that sounds & looked  like exactly what happened Cheesy..

Guess, if that don't work, we'll have to stick with DM & some CTF. Or we could just disable map changes.. :)

I don't think I'll ever get time to update the HPB bot anytime in the near future.  I originally had problems with teams in OpFor and had to use "hgrunt;scientist" for the teams to keep the bots from thinking that they were on the same team (and not shooting at each other).  See the planethalflife.com/botman/old_news.shtmlold news for November 12th, 2000.

If you can't get that to work you might want to try using www.planethalflife.com/teambot/TEAMbot or akimbot.nuclearbox.com/Akimbot, they both support OpFor, but I don't know if they support OpFor teamplay and OpFor CTF.

botman I had a look at the UTIL_GetTeam function in your template, I don't know if any of the normal HL models are used in Opfor CTF so I can't tell if all of the models are checked in the function completly.

Would there be no actual easier way to get the actual team of the player instead of finding what models they are?

OpFor teamplay sets the player model in the same way that Half-Life deathmatch does.  The code in UTIL_GetTeam() examines the "mp_teamlist" to determine which one of these teams the enemy is on.  If the team is different from the bots team then the bot will target this player.

This is different from OpFor CTF since in CTF you can choose from a few limited players (the black mesa players against the opposing force players).  These models will ALWAYS be one of the ones shown in UTIL_GetTeam().  For example, you can't play OpFor CTF using homer and skeleton models.
