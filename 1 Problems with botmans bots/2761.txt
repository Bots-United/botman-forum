Download the HPB bot, OddBot, or FoxBot, and read the enclosed ReadMe.txt file (or HTML documentation if there is any).

For the HPB bot, you will need to download the executable, run it to extract (unzip) the files, then you will need to use Windows Explorer to browse into the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder.  There will be folders inside the HPB_bot folder for each MOD.  Inside each of these MOD folders will be a batch file called "Install.bat".  Just run that to install the bot for that particular MOD.  When you start a LAN game, bots will be added automatically.  Read the HPB_bot_ReadMe.txt file found in the Half-Life\HPB_bot folder for more details.

Yes, if you want the bots to play half-way intelligently, you will need waypoint files for the maps that you want to play.  These can be downloaded from web sites that provide waypoint files (see my "Waypoints" web page for some URLs), or you can make them yourself (for bots that support user created waypoint files).
