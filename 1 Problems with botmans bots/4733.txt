OK...  I run game servers hosted by Recon Gamer.  Which basically means my serves are at a remote location instead of my residence.

Do I have to run the Bat file in order to run the HPB_bot?

Are there bots out there where I do not need a Bat file to install?

I am trying to get atleast 2-3 bots on our servers.

Thanks for any help,

You can manually copy (or FTP) the files to the proper directories.  Here's what the batch files copies (from -> to), I'll use TFC as an example since you didn't say what MOD...

HPB_bot\tfc\liblist.gam  ->  Half-Life\tfc\liblist.gam

HPB_bot\tfc\HPB_bot.cfg  ->  Half-Life\tfc\HPB_bot.cfg

HPB_bot\HPB_bot_names.txt  ->  Half-Life\tfc\HPB_bot_names.txt

HPB_bot\HPB_bot_chat.txt  ->  Half-Life\tfc\HPB_bot_chat.txt

HPB_bot\HPB_bot_logo.cfg  ->  Half-Life\tfc\HPB_bot_logo.cfg

HPB_bot\tfc\*.HPB_wpt  ->  Half-Life\tfc\maps\*.*

HPB_bot\HPB_bot.dll  ->  Half-Life\tfc\dlls\HPB_bot.dll

Obviously replace 'tfc' with whatever MOD you are using (cstrike, dmc, etc.).  And interpret "->" as "copy file to here" or "ftp file to here" depending on whether you are manually copying files on the same machine or FTPing files from your machine to the target machine.

P.S. BEFORE YOU START, save a copy of the liblist.gam file you are about to overwrite so that you can restore it later if things go wrong.  The only thing you need to do to "undo" the installation is restore the original liblist.gam file.
