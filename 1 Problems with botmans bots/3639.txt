I have a small completed MOD which I compiled and works, but then I lost the source. So there are still a few bugs. One was a problem with precaching which is why I turned to Botmans DLL. I knew I could use it to force a precache but can I intercept anything? The  one problem that is left is I created a flame thrower which then created flame entities. They were doing to much damage too often to the player shooting them so I made them not hurt the attacker. There must have been a problem with my logic (although I can't check it) because they hurt no one! Although they do do damage to things like crates?! Is there a way I could intercept a flames touch function? 

Thanks
