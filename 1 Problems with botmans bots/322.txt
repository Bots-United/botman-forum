Hi, i don't know if this bug has been reported or not but...

in counterstrike the bot systems NNBot and RealBot do not work very well.  Ok they're crap under WinME and 2k.  The bots hardly move and just spin round all the time.

Please fix the bug someone... don't tell me if i've posted in the wrong list :)

No, you haven't posted to the wrong list, but I have seen lots of other complaints about Half-Life and Win2K/WinME.  Valve supposedly has some patches out that addresses Win2K.  Check the Half-Life Official section on www.fileplanet.com to see if you can find Win2K patches.

I don't have Win2K and don't ever plan to get it.  I didn't even want Win98 on my harddrive, but when I was setting up a secondary drive with Win98 Microsoft decided to go ahead and upgrade my other Win95 drive with Win98 also even though it didn't ask me if I wanted to do this!  :(

I've seen this bug in Windows 98SE, ME, and 2K, with NNbot, Realbot, and HPB bot, but I don't think it has anything to do with the OS.  It seems to be a framerate issue.  Someone on the Realbot forums discovered this. 

Many of us have video cards that allow us to reach framerates in the vicinity of 100, so we set fps_max accordingly (I think it's 72 by default).  If you set fps_max much lower to say 30, the bots will stop jumping and spinning in place and resume their normal functions.  I'm not sure why this is, but it fixed the problem for me.  You can even add this command into your bot.cfg file, so it will load it every time when playing with the bots. 

Hope that gives some more insight into the cause of the problem so you can fix it, or at the very least, functions as a quick fix for those who are having trouble with it.

Nope fps_max didn't do anything for me... i tried it before from 1 to 200 with no effect (except for a drop in frame rate).

setting it to 1 doesn't actually limit it to 1 fps but more like 10...

shucks...  Well, it was worth a shot.  It definitely worked for me in Windows 98SE.  All of these bots would stay in one place and spaz, spin, and jump.  When I started moving the fps_max value down, they would do less and less of that and start moving more and more until it got low enough where they would work correctly all the time.  When I increased fps_max again, they gradually started to repeat the same spazzing routine more and more as fps_max got higher until the bots were stationary and weren't playable anymore.  What's strange is that a friend of mine has a similar system with Windows 98SE and has had no problems with bots even with fps_max set at 100.  Go figure.

I haven't been able to test the fps_max fix on WinME or Win2K yet, but I was trying to use the bots on a dedicated server with both of those OS's and experiencing the same problem (this was on a different computer from my main one with Win98SE).  I'll try it with WinME and the dedicated server tonight and see if I can get the bots to work this time.  If not, I guess we'll have to hope that newer versions will provide a fix. =(

Here are the main posts from the Realbot forum that are related to this problem if they help at all.

I tried the most recent release of Realbot (FTR 1) on WinME and my own dedicated server yesterday, and it worked well.  No spazzing.  I'm not sure if the new version fixed the bug completely or just the fact that the creator added fps_max 45 by default to the bot.cfg file fixed it (didn't have time to remove that line and see what happens).  You should try this new version as it might just solve your problems as well.  We can always hope.  =)  Now if the "changelevel crashing" bug would just be fixed...

I'm going to install a dual-booting Win2000 back on the same machine with WinME this weekend and see if they work with that now too.  Wish I could offer you more options to try and get it to work for you.  By all means, get a modem!  Bots are a good distraction and good for practice, but nothing beats playing with human opponents (outside of the fact that some can be jerks or cheat).  Even better with friends.

I finally tried the fps_max fix with HPB_bot.  Even though this fixed my problems in Win98SE and WinME for Realbot and NNbot (though the newer versions of both bots seem to work at any value of fps_max w/ both OS's now), it didn't fix HPB_bot in WinME (it appears to work fine in Win98SE now where previous versions had the same problem).  No matter what value of fps_max I set the bots continue to spaz/jump/spin in the same place.

At least there is some progress as I couldn't use any bots in 98SE, ME, or 2K a few weeks ago, and now all work in 98SE and some in ME (didn't get to test 2K at all yet).  Hopefully with newer versions and Valve patches, the problems will continue to disappear.  For now, I suggest using Win98 if you want to be able use all bots with no problems.
