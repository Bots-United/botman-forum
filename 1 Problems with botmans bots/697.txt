You musta got caught up reading, and missed it?
But where it says Front Line Force on his front page, it's a clickable link that will take you to their site. ;D

It's called a "hypertext link".  That's the 'H' part of HTML.  A hypertext link allows you to link to another location within text by assigning tags to the text to indicate that it should "link" to another location.  When you click on the hypertext link your browser will automagically transport you to that location. ;)
