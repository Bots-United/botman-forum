Subject: HPB for Linux Server (Only FTP Acess)
--------------------------------------------------

Hello,

I've read (and tried) a lot about all that stuff but i can't figure out how it works. (Sorry for my bad english)

So, we have rent a Half-Life Deathmatch Server @ www.gameserver4u.de (213.146.191.81:27040). We only have FTP Acess and a web interface. And no comandline. Adminmod (Metamod) is running. Also a few Admin/Metamod plugins. I can't use the installer for HPB Linux on that ftp. The Server is running with Steam.

That is the liblist.gam:

game "Counter-Strike"
url_info "www.counter-strike.net"
url_dl ""
version "1.5"
size "184000000"
svonly "0"
secure "1"
type "multiplayer_only"
cldll "1"
hlversion "1111"
nomodels "1"
nohimodel "1"
mpentity "info_player_start"
gamedll "dlls\mp.dll"
gamedll_linux "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod_i386.so"
trainmap "tr_1"

So, don't know why it's counter-strike, we have HL Deathmatch. Can you help me installing the HPB Bot? Ive tried a lot, but always got error messages.

Thanks,
Loam

echo "Copying HPB_bot_i486.so into valve/dlls directory"
echo "Copying HPB_bot.cfg into valve directory"
echo "Copying HPB_bot_names.txt into valve directory"
echo "Copying HPB_bot_chat.txt into valve directory"
echo "Copying HPB_bot_logo.cfg into valve directory"
echo "Copying liblist.gam and old_liblist.gam into valve directory"

See this thread on manually copying the files (this example is for TFC)...

Also, for metamod, you will have to use the "+localinfo" line and put the .so file in the addons folder that the metamod.ini file uses...

thx so far,
but I had no success.

Thats what I did:

Copied:
HPB_bot.cfg to /hlvalve_steam/valve
HPB_bot_chat.txt to /hlvalve_steam/valve
HPB_bot_logo.cfg to /hlvalve_steam/valve
HPB_bot_names.txt to /hlvalve_steam/valve
liblist.gam to /hlvalve_steam/valve
HPB_bot_i486.so to /hlvalve_steam/valve/dlls

added that line in custom.cfg in /hlvalve_steam/valve(that one is loaded with the server.cfg: 
localinfo mm_gamedll "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod_i386.so"

(We don't have metamod.dll, only metamod_i386.so, so I changed the name)

That is the server.cfg:

// Pre Config //
// pre //
// Pre Config ende//

//User - Config einbinden //
exec custom.cfg


 // Passwoerter // 
sv_password "none"
rcon_password "***"


// Startbefehle // 

// hostname // 
hostname "www.mcm-clan.de Server @ www.serverarena.de ::: by gameserver4u.de :::"

// Post Config // 
// post //
// Post Config ende// 
// - Publicserver - Config created by gameserver4u - System - at 12.11.2003 22:30:56 //

The Server is time out. Seems it does not even load metamod, adminmod, whatever.

I don't know ANYTHING about getting metamod to work on Steam based Half-Life servers.

Check the forums on www.adminmod.org website, since it uses metamod.  I'm sure there's lots of posts there on how to get metamod (and AdminMOD, even though you aren't using AdminMOD) working on Steam Linux servers.

lol, sry, maybe I did not say it clear enough.

Adminmod and Metamod worked well before. I have a lot of Plugins running on Adminmod and Metamod. But the way I described above does not start the Server.

That is my original liblist.gam and it works perfect:

game "Counter-Strike"
url_info "www.counter-strike.net"
url_dl ""
version "1.5"
size "184000000"
svonly "0"
secure "1"
type "multiplayer_only"
cldll "1"
hlversion "1111"
nomodels "1"
nohimodel "1"
mpentity "info_player_start"
gamedll "dlls\mp.dll"
gamedll_linux "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod_i386.so"
trainmap "tr_1"

...as the last post in the second thread linked above says...

localinfo mm_gamedll "addons/hpb_bot/dlls/hpb_bot.dll" 

...I think metamod WANTS the HPB bot DLL (or .so file in your case) to be in the 'addons' folder.

Why don't you try the plugin version of the HPB_bot ?

just a hint :)

all you need to do is make a autoexec.cfg file in your main (valve) directory and put the line that botman posted above into it.

the localinfo line.
they'll work. look for my thread on running bots on a recongamer server.

make sure you have the fix for the bots though, i think botman said they dont work with cs 1.6 steam....akimbot does if you dont want to make the changes to the hpb bot source... basically i think akimbot IS botmans code with those changes made to it...almost every file and the layout is identical to hpb bot
