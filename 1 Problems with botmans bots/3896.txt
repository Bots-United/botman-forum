Were the bots working BEFORE you created the waypoint file?

P.S. The BSP tool waypoint generator REALLY isn't all that good.  It was meant as a starting point for people to use to try to create a nice fully functional automatic waypoint system.  You should really load the waypoints generated by the BSP tool and the manually delete and add some waypoints to make them "better" (i.e. lined up with doorways, hallways, etc.).

Then it sounds like you don't have something installed correctly.  Try running the Remove.bat file for 'valve' to uninstall the HPB bot, then run the Install.bat file to re-install the HPB bot again.

That's either because you haven't shut down your HL server, or something went wrong with your computer (HL crashed, for example.)

Restart your computer and try again.

If you are using WinNT or WinXP, make sure you are logged in as the Administrator (or that you have permissions to write to that directory).

people have no duty to reply to your posts, Mog, especially when they don't have the answer for you.

Uninstall Half-Life and reinstall it again. See if it helps.

Format your hard disk.  Reinstall all your Windows apps (including Half-Life).  Update Half-Life to the latest version.  Reinstall any Half-Life MODs you wish to use.  Reinstall any bots you wish to use.  Ta-da!  Problem solved.

I have to do this about every 9 to 12 months on my PC with Windows 98SE.

all that just for bots? hey botman, could you send me just the HPBbot_dll for Valve. it doesnt install right because my valve folder is completely Devoid of ANY dll folder. would Admin/Metamod maybe help any? like so... 

+localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/hpb_bot.dll

it works for OP4CTF. i just dont have the DLL for the bots in hldm.

The HPB_bot DLL is always the same, whatever MOD you install the bot for. Just copy it from gearbox/dlls to valve/dlls.

Maybe your dll folder is "Read-Only" & "Hidden"..

To find out,
In your file manager goto "Tools - Folder Options"..
This - grubber.hypermart.net/pics/show%20all.jpgScreenShot

Check it to show ALL Files..

Then if you finally see the folder maker sure it's not "Read-Only" by Right Clicking on the folder & selecting "Properties"..
If there's a check in the "Read-Only" just un-check it.

If you've allready done those, why agonize yourself... Format or Re-install HL... Like botman said.

i have a hldm folder that's separated from valve, could it be the same mod? because i only have 1 half-life deathmatch listed on the mods list.

and grubber's right, don't look for it, it will show up if you 'Show all folders'.
