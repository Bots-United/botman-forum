The HPB Bot wasn't designed to play Firearms. If you want a bot to play that MOD, get the FireBot. I have no idea where you can get the bot though. If I had the link right infront of me, I could tell you.

 He was talking about the firebot not the hpb_bot to play on firearms,but david, how new are you? have you tried to type addbot in console? lol, you might have installed it wrong, besides your asking the wrong forum go to their site http://www.bots.firearmsmod.com/

Also they might have the "spinning and jumping" problem.  Set your frame rate to a slower speed (less than 50 FPS) and it should fix that problem.
