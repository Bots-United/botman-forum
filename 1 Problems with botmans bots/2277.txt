Help! normally I start a single player with bots by pressing the lan game link(half-life, CS,   TFC, etc) but how can I start a game by accessing the console link?(you know? its on the main menu. can be ENABLED BY THE "C:\SIERRA\Half-hife\hl.exe -console" aim shortcut for those who do not know) because Im getting quit pissed off by the "arghh I have to press the esc button again but its too hard to do it" thing in openGL bec my computer hangs most of the time but i want to use openGL because its a lot better than d3d(mouse lag). And if I acsess the console on the main menu with opengl it does not blur.

my QUESTION(begging):anyone knows how to create a game (If the commands are different, then I would like to know how to do it on cs) directly at the console on the main menu?

thank you [;-)

My HL menu sometimes "hangs" by playing on the internet games and then pressing escape back to the internet games listing. If you actually click resume game, it still works with me. Same with it you press "done", then escape twice then enter! :)

run hl.exe with something like...

hl.exe -game MODNAME -console +sv_lan 1 +maxplayers 16 +map MAPNAME

:) of course the MODNAME is the name of the mod you want to play. and MAPNAMNE is the map u want to play.
