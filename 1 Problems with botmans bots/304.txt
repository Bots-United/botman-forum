Wwll, I DO agree that there SHOULD be more waypoints for counter-strike BUT the HPB_BOT is limited in counter-strike at the moment. (ie. It can't buy weapons, can't plant bombs etc.. etc..)
These MAY be added in a "distant" future release.
The main function and feature of the HPB_Bot at the moment is to get a nice decent TFC Bot up and running as this IS the only half-decent and nice bot for TFC!!!

I would suggest using some other "dedicated" counterstrike bots in the mean time. Check botman's links for links to some other bot sites or check the REALBOT out (It's great, it don't need waypoints!) at:
