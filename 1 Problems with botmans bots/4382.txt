hi, 

i am trying to get HPB to run with HLGuard on my dedicted linux server, and it won't seem to work. I installed the HPB v3 via the script, which killed HL Guard, when i reinstalled HL Guard, HPB is gone.

the rest of my setup is:
red hat v 9 - kernel 2.4.20-9
cstrike 1.5
hlds 3.1.1.1
admin mod v2.50.52

HELP!!!

AdminMOD requires (uses) metamod.  See the this previous post about getting the HPB bot to work with metamod...

I don't know whether HLGuard is a metamod plugin or not (I've never used it), but it is listed on the metamod.org website as a metamod plugin, so it's probably just a plugin as well...

See if someone in the United Admins forum has any experience installing HLGuard with other metamod plugins (and is using the +localinfo command line option).
