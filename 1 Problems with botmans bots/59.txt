This bot doesnt use waypoints im sure you know about it...??Released  August 31, 2000 - 7:44 EST  celtic88



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another Counter-Strike bot has been released, titled the Realbot. As with the others, this one is still in it's early design with the AI, but several interesting features have already made it's way into this version, including:
Some communications between bots, they call for help using "NEED BACKUP", when they spot an enemy "ENEMY SPOTTED", other bots who can see the bot shouting this, will help. Bots only support bots! Heh, don't worry, they will support you automaticly when you encounter an enemy and the bot also can see him.
Simple buy stuff, this means, it buys primitive weapons. Not all weapons are (yet) supported.
Beta 7 Support
Own Navigation code.
Chase/ Follow Entity Movement code, which let bots move through most CS Maps.
Only CS_ and DE_ Maps supported
Bots open doors
Bots use ladders
Somewhat better un-stuck code
Bots NEVER walk the same way twice, they use NO waypoints.
20 Random names
Skills somewhat better than the HPB_BOT
Freezetime accepted (still buggy)
Pick up alpha 1 here.

This Bot plays Counter-Strike, it currently will try to find an enemy and
it will hunt 'm down. The bots automaticly choose a team. The code is
based uppon the HPB Bot Alpha 2 source, this code is stripped down and
the CS parts have been rewritten or added.

This bot DOES'NT use waypoints! This bot is the only one so far who can
navigate through CS maps without the knowledge of waypoints. I'll try
to update the AI and its navigation code as much as possible so it will
make the bot looks marter and you can play every map with it you like to.

How to play with the bots:
==========================
Simple, start a LAN game , with 8 players. Automaticly 7 Bots are added
in the game. If you don't want to have bots added to the game automaticly
then edit BOT.CFG and remove the ADDBOT commands at the end of the file.

To add a bot to the game, bring down the console using ~ and then type:
"addbot" , without the ". A bot will be added with a random name and
random skill, it will choose a team and begins to play Counter-Strike.


The Navigation Code / Supported Maps
====================================
Currently the Bots only support CS and DE Maps. Other maps are just
to difficult for the Bot. The Bot uses its own unique navigation code
and its still in early stage. It navigates using a FE system. 
FE-> Follow Entity System, this means it will use the entities it
encounters as waypoints in a map. Doors for example, also buttons
and also each other starting locations. The entity system uses the basic
entities in levels, such as lights, sounds , doors and ladders. It has
a main goal , and when it can't reach it directly it will search for
one of these entities which can lead him closer to his goal. The goals
are:

-> Enemy Starting location
-> Own starting location (when a bot reaches his enemy starting location
it will reverse)
-> Hostages
-> Bomb spots

The Navigation code is still in early stage, so don't expect from the
bot it will get everywhere on the map. It can get stuck but will un-stuck
himself in 2 seconds. 

All DE or CS levels can be played, i do not recommend them all. I haven't
tested them all yet, but if you have suggestions, bugs, or anything else
about the bots navigation in a certain map (and spot) then please mail me
so i can squise these bugs and make them navigate good enough in all maps.


Version Information:
====================
Alpha 1 - Public Release

A.I:
- Bots can navigate good enough in CS Maps
- Bots can open up doors in cs_militia and cs_assault (rotating ones too!)
- Bots can move up and down on ladders (not smart enough though)
- Bots can duck and jump
- Bots will try to find the enemy starting location
- Bots will try more softly to avoid stuff , they don't turn away entirely now.
- Bots have their own un-stuck code

Game Rules:
- It gains money by killing an opponent
- It buys simple weapons and ammo.

Misc:
- Bots can use radio commands if under fire, when lonely and needing 
  assistance etc. Other bots do no listen yet to radio commands, so
  for the moment the player has to react on it.

Radio:
- Bots say "Enemy Spotted" when detected a new enemy, and "Enemy Down" when
  the enemy is dead. 

- Bots call for backup when needing it, e.g. more enemy's than friends will
  let bots call for backup (not always).

BOTMAN:
The RealBot is based upon the HPB_Bot Code Alpha 2, by Botman. Without him, no
CS Bots could ever be made! Thanx botman!

Robert,

You might wanna have a look and read at my site (see www button below) to see how you use way points to:
- do super efficient pathfinding, freeing up CPU for real tactical AI
- use way points to get a good tactical understanding of the terrain, reason about bounding overwatch, sniping, cover, ambush, etc.

I understand that a 'no waypoints' is a very attractive feature for bot users at this stage of CS bot AI (compared to the AI of the better UT/Q3A/Q2 bots), since you avoid the bad way point files.
However, for tactical terrain specific AI, you just cannot do without a good terrain representation.
Waypoints happen to be handy for terrain representations, and offer pathfinding at nearly no additional CPU load.
