Have you tried uninstalling Half-Life, deleteing the Half-Life folder, reinstalling Half-Life, installing the 1.1.0.4 update and reinstalling the HPB bot?  This seems to work about 90% of the time when people have problems with crashing.  The other problem usually has to do with not having the latest version of the driver for your video card.

too much work. i'd rather play w/ the other bots. at least untill your bot can build sg's.

Hehe...I'm using a combo of HBP bots and ABots, for SGs!  Can't wait until HBP bots build SGs.
