I ran into an odd problem today. I've got the latest hpb_bots running on my server, and they work great. I restarted the server, and the bots would not join the server. I restarted twice - no bots. Hmm...edit hpb_bot.cfg. Change nothing. Save file. Restart server. Bots now join. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Was this a one time weirdity, or has anyone else seen this?

I guess you are running a dedicated server. You need to have the min_bots and max_bots command set i think in the HPB_bot.cfg

You might try and add bots manually by typing 

bot "addbot"

in the server.

I do have min_bots and max_bots set in HPB_bot.cfg. They are set to 2 and 4, respectively. It's worked fine every since, so I'm not sure what to think. If it does it again, I'll post details here.
