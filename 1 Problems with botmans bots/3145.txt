Hey everyone I have this preoblem when trying to join a LAN game on my home network... It says 'Couldn't complete connection attempt'. The computer serving the game is a celeron 366 with 288 meg of ram and a decent video card... The computer I'm trying to join with is a p2 300 with 64 meg of ram. This occurs especially with DoD and CS. I'm pretty sure its because the p2 cant load the level up fast enough. Is there any way i can 'preload' the level or something like that so that it will join properly? I would appreciate any help you could provide. Thanks

If you are using any firewall software (like ZoneAlarm), turn if OFF before trying to connect to the Half-Life server.
