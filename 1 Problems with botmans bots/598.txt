I played boot_camp for 30 minutes, and TFC terminated, without any errors. It just closed. I have HPB Bot 3.0 BETA, and I have the latest Half-Life version.

I thought I had fixed the map change crashing problem.

BeaverMon, it sounds like you need to uninstall Half-Life, reinstall it, patch it up to version 1.1.0.4, and reinstall the bots, or wipe out your disk and reinstall Windows (plus Half-Life, patches, bots, etc.).

Actually the crashing during map changes which I had a problem with does seem to be fixed. Good job botman. Also thanx for fixing the FPS problem as well.

At least it didn't crash in 5 minutes. And I found out it's ONLY the DM levels, that crash. the CTF levels don't crash, or I haven't tried playing them for 30+ minutes. Other then that, no problems with Half-Life!

Great job on the bots so far, Botman! An A+, for you!
