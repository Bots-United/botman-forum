I am currently having to run half-life on a satnd alone PC with no network capabilities (e.g. no modem, netwok card, etc), because of this there are no IP addresses on the computer, because of this I can't start a LAN game using the current HL patch. It says 'Could not allocate IP address for HLTV'. Is there any sort of walk around for this that would disable HLTV.

All the best, Bob

Those warning messages won't cause any problems.  They are just telling you that MULTICAST can't be used on your network configuration.  Just ignore those messages.

That doesn't happen, it just crashes!

I would strongly recommend uninstalling Half-Life, DELETE the Half-Life folder (and everything in it), reinstall Half-Life, update to version 1.1.0.8, then reinstall whatever MODs & bots you want to use.

Also make sure you have the latest drivers for your video card.
