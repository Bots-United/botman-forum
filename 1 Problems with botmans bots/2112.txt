I've just finished (well, for now anyway) a waypoint file for Avanti. Although it -IMO- plays quite good, it does not play so well when Team 1 (whom start as Attackers) take all CPs and switch to being Defenders while Team 2 switch to attack. To make the bots play as well as possible and to make gameplay fast flowing I've used some team specific waypoints. This works great until the switch, but since the Defenders are still regarded as Team 1 (the Attackers) by the waypoint system, things are not working properly when the teams switch sides.
This all boils down to my questions:

<b>1)</b> Would it be possible to make Team 1 respond to whomever (Red or Blue) is attacking, and Team 2 respond to being defenders ? Why / Why not ?

<b>2)</b> Are there any reasons why -if possible- this setup wouldn't be desireable ?

<b>3)</b>Also, when the teams switch, the gates are open from the beginning, but CLOSE at the end of the 30 second countdown (which is a bummer when attacking bots get killed before capturing CP 2). I haven't been able to find out the reason for this, but maybe somebody out there has an idea...?

I think that the ODDbot does more like what you want.  Take a look at it for TFC maps that have a little more complex game rules than standard CTF or reverse CTF...

So, no way around it using the HPB_bot then ?

I was hoping to stick with the bot I love  :-(

Thanks for the feedback, though, and thanks for creating a great companion for me to use the five months I've been offline and forced to play nothing but bots.

I would LOVE to be able to get the HPB bot to handle more types of game rules (in TFC and other MODs as well), but I just don't have the time to work on it much anymore.

Perhaps you can combine HPB and ODDbot using the BotMaster5000 and have more HPB bots on maps that they know how to play and have more ODDbots on the maps that they know how to play.  You get the best of both worlds!  :)
