Since we should avoid looooooong threads that aren't about the HPB bot here, could you check out http://pub31.ezboard.com/bwaypointwarehouse67901

which is the waypoint warehouse forum. I don't think the visit waypoints are working right.

ARES...I see you are currently on the forum....sorry about the false alarm: after trying it out using 'visits' and not 'visites' :) the bot takes a random route every time and looks brilliant.

BUT......

Could you visit the waypoint forum again, I'll post there (might be a long post so give me time....), it's either a suggestion or a complaint (depending on your point of view!)

I will look there from time to time.
I will have my own forum very soon.
