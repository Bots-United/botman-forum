has anyone got the logo's to work for FLF or any mod that uses the valve decal wad, whenever i try i get the message "error writing decal wad" and am unable to have the bots using logo's. I know there is nothing wrong with the logo's themsleves because i have used them before AND they work fine with the bots for TFC. I tried using wally to add them, but have little experience with it and when i tried to save them it said i wasn't allowed to modify that file (valve decal wad) 
Any suggestions how to fix it?

It sounds like you valve\decals.wad file is marked as "read only".  Use Windows Explorer to browse to the Half-Life\valve directory and click once on decals.wad.  Use the right mouse button and click on it, then select Properties.  Uncheck the "Read-only" attribute checkbox and click on "OK".

You should then be able to modify the file.
