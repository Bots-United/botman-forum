I'm just wondering, in the download section, why is there "botman's bots" #1 all the way to #10?

Is each of them a different version?

Also, those bots aren't compatible with HLDM, meaning that you don't run HLDM to play them.  They are actually a separate MODs that have bots built into them during multiplayer mode.  But, let me ask, what does this serve?

If I host a game on the Net with these bots "1-10", nobody will join unless they run the bot MOD. Because the game I'm hosting isn't really HLDM.  

What's the point of this, botman?

The bots "1-10" are botmans bots for HLDM only, the numbers are the different versions, 1 being the oldest version.

They support HLDM even though they are actually seperate mods because they don't need to hook with the mp DLL becuase the bot DLL is basically the mp DLL + the bot in one, so this is taken as a different "game" and is in a different folder. So to play it you need to run it like 

"hl.exe -game <bot folder in here>"

It is the same for jumbot and other "old" HLDM only bots, before botman created the mp dll hook framework ;D

If you are tryin to use a different MOD, use the HPB_Bot.

Sorry, what exactly is this "mp dll hook" you speak of?

That is the HPB_Bot framework in a sense. It hooks with the multiplayer DLL file so you can use it with the Mod multiplayer/server side mode.

Ah... so when you install a HPB, your multiplayer dll is modified?

No, the "hook" part means that the HPB bot hooks in between the Half-Life engine and the MOD game DLL code.

Half-Life multiplayer is a MOD.  TFC is a MOD.  Counter-Strike is a MOD.  The HPB bot code hooks in between the engine and the MOD to allow bots to be added to MODs.

That is the same way cheats work!!! Some anti-cheat mod called cheating-death said so.

That is correct.  Hooks on the client side hook in between the Half-Life engine and the client DLL code (the HPB bot hooks between the engine and the game DLL code which runs the MOD).

Hooks on the server side (using the game DLL) are also how metamod and AdminMOD work.
