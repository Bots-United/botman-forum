I haven't had time to try to make waypoints for OpFor.  I'm sure there isn't anything you can do to prevent this.  I'll look into this and see if it's a fairly simple fix.

Steve e-mailed me: the problem was that the maps in cs tfc etc.. were not in a PAK file, for some reason it worked when he extracted them into the maps folder of the mod.
