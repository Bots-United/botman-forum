1. Download and install the Linux dedicated server on a Linux box...

...see the linuxreadme.txt file contained in the above for setup instructions.

2. Download the HPB bot for Linux.

3. Install the HPB bot in your hlds_l directory.

4. Change to the HPB_bot directory under the hlds_l directory, then change to the directory for the MOD you want (for example hlds_l/HPB_bot/tfc for Team Fortress Classic).

5. Run the Install script by entering "./Install"

6. Edit the bot.cfg file found in the hlds_l/tfc directory and change the number of bots or the bot skill level (comments inside this file explain what to do).

7. Start the dedicated server the way you normally would (for example "./hlds_run -game tfc +maxplayers 16 +map 2fort")

Bots will automatically be added to the game based on the bot.cfg file settings.

If you want to run linux without worrying about partioning your disk, try DragonLinux or PhatLinux.
