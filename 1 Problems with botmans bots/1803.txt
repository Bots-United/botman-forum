I guess it is supposed to simulate the dyslexic way that people can sometimes type when they are mad or trying to type in the dark, or perhaps trying to type too fast. Right Botman?

Yeah tottaly.
Dont people ever read the changes file or even the homepage when Botman says whats new in this version

Maybe people dont press p insetad of s that often but people defiently do not type -=[CLAN]=-PopDog[CL]

And when ppl are mad they just go NIFSDIFSDIFBHSDIF to get thier point accross :P

It doesn't substitue letters.  It will occasioinally drop a letter and will occasionally swap 2 letters, but it doesn't substitue one letter for another.
