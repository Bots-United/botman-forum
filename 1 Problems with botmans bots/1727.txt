What is the line in the config that changes your handedness?  I don't see it in there, i know i have changed it before.  I had to reinstall and man is it annoying running around lefty.

thanks!

I think it's...

"setinfo lefthand 0"

...or you can go into the Advanced settings in Customize and uncheck the lefthanded model box to always start with right handed models.

Thanks, i just added that line to the bottom of my cfg and it worked.  I used to have that line there, i wonder why i had to add it this time.
