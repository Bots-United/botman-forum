Hi, 
I can only fight against three bots. Can I set a higher number of bots (like 6)?

Hello

To add bots, either bring down the console and type 'addbot', or edit the .cgf files that come with the bot you're using, and look for 'addbot'. They're scripts that get run when the game starts. You can add whatever engine command you want in them ; for instance, 'addbot' 's.

You can type "addbot" in the console (without quotes) to add another bot. Also if you open up the HPB_Bot.cfg file in the folder of the MOD that you are running (i.e. tfc) it will have addbot at the bottom of it a few times. You can add more lines to say "addbot" to the config file. When you load the bot again then more bots should be added depending on how many "addbot"'s are in the config file! :-)

1.How can I bring down the console?
2. This is the whole HPB_bot.cfg file :
I Have added "addbot" three times.



# This is the HPB_bot.cfg file (for Half-Life deathmatch & teamplay)
#
# Any line begining with '#' in the first column is a comment line
#
# The following commands are supported in the bot.cfg file:
#
# addbot - will add a bot using a random skin and the default bot skill level
# addbot <model> - will add a bot using the specified model with the
#      default skill level.
# addbot <model> <name> - will add a bot using the specified model and
#      player name and the default bot skill level.
# addbot <model> <name> <skill> - will add a bot using the specified model,
#      player, and skill level (where skill level is 1 to 5, 1 being the
#      best skilled and 5 being the worst skilled).
#
# botskill <skill> - change the default botskill level (1 to 5).
#                    skill level 1 is the best, skill level 5 is the worst.
#
# observer <value> - change the observer mode setting, 1=on, 0=off.
#
# botdontshoot <value> - change the botdontshoot setting, 1=on, 0=off.
#
# pause <timeout> - pause for the specified number of seconds before
#      continuing with the commands in the bot.cfg file.
#
# min_bots <value> - configure the minimum number of bots that will run
#      on this dedicated server.
#
# max_bots <value> - configure the maximum number of bots that will run
#      on this dedicated server.
#
# bot_strafe_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bot will strafe
#      left and right while running.  Allowed values are 0 - 100.  The
#      default value is 20.  Note: a higher straffing percentage causes
#      the bots to fall off of narrow walkways and causes them problems
#      getting through doorways.
#
# bot_chat_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bot will use the
#      "say" command to send a bot_chat (checked every 30 seconds)
#      Allowed values are 0 - 100.  The default value is 10.
#
# bot_taunt_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bot will use the
#      "say" command to send a bot_taunt message after killing another
#      player.  Allowed values are 0 - 100.  The default value is 20.
#
# bot_whine_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bot will use the
#      "say" command to send a bot_whine message after being killed.
#      Allowed values are 0 - 100.  The default value is 10.
#
# bot_chat_tag_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bots will remove
#      clan tags from player names.  The default value is 80.
#
# bot_chat_drop_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bots will drop
#      characters from chat messages.  The default value is 10.
#
# bot_chat_swap_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bots will swap
#      characters in chat messages.  The default value is 10.
#
# bot_chat_lower_percent <value> - sets the percent of time bots will
#      convert chat messages to all lowercase.  The default is 50.
#
# bot_logo_percent <value> - sets the percent of time the bot will attempt
#      to spray a custom spray logo after killing an opponent.  The default
#      value is 40.
#
# bot_reaction_time <value> - sets the reaction time delay of the bots.
#      When the bots see a new enemy they will delay slightly before firing
#      to simulate a human reaction time delay.  The reaction time delay is
#      also based on the bot skill setting for that bot.  High skilled bots
#      (with skill level of 1 or 2) will have shorter reaction time delays
#      than lower skilled bots (with skill level 3, 4, or 5).  The delay
#      value can be...
#      0 - disables the bot reaction time.
#      1 - very short reaction time delay. (between 0.01 and 0.10 seconds)
#      2 - moderate reaction time delay.
#      3 - fairly long reaction time delay. (between 0.10 and 0.30 seconds)
#      The default value is 2.
#
# random_color <value> - sets whether or not you wish to spawn bots with
#      random topcolor and bottomcolor values.  Set the value to 0 to
#      disable random colors.  Set the value to 1 to enable random colors.
#      The default value is 1.
#
# Any other commands in the bot.cfg file will be treated as server
# commands.  For example, you can use "map mapname" (without the quotes)
# to select a specific map, or you can use "mp_forcerespawn 1" to turn
# on force respawn, or "kick # 1" to automatically kick player number 1.
#

# wait for 3 seconds
pause 3

# change default bot skill level to 2
botskill 2

# Remove the comments on the 2 lines below to support a minimum and maximum
# number of bots running on a dedicated server.  Bots will be added to the
# server until the total number of players (bots and humans) reaches the
# max_bots value.  Each time a new player joins the server, a bot will be
# kicked from the server unless there are only min_bots number of bots
# currently on the server.  After players disconnect from the server, bots
# will be automatically added back to the server until the total number
# of players reaches max_bots again.  You should make max_bots be AT LEAST
# one less than the maxplayers value (otherwise no one will be able to join
# your server).

#min_bots 2
#max_bots 6

bot_chat_percent 10
bot_taunt_percent 20
bot_whine_percent 10

bot_chat_tag_percent 80
bot_chat_drop_percent 10
bot_chat_swap_percent 10
bot_chat_lower_percent 50

bot_logo_percent 40
bot_reaction_time 2

# add 6 bots using the default skill level (a random skin will be chosen)

You may also need to change the amount of memory in the heap (the heapsize parameter).  See the Phineas Bot FAQ Question #3...

Yeah, thanks.
But I Don't know how to change the heapsize. Can you give me the name of the file?

lets say you want to play TFC. load HL up like this

hl.exe -game tfc -heapsize 32000 -console

to bring down the console up the '`' button whilst playing. Its the button below the Esc button :)

Ok, but I cannot activate the console in valve. I have updated half-Life but now I can't bring down the console.

To activate the console, edit the Half-Life\valve\config.cfg file using Notepad (or any text editor).  Look for this...

console "0.00000"

...and change it to this...

console "1.00000"

...then save the file and restart Half-Life.

I did it, but when I insert "heapsize 20000" into the console, nothing happens.

Unknown command:heapsize

Why?

"heapsize" is not a console command but a command used when you start up the program.

You should use it on the command line along with hl.exe -command1 -command2 etc

so you should load up HL.exe like this to get a heapsize of 32 MB...

code:

hl.exe -heapsize 32000

It runs.

-------------------------------------------------
Why does Half-Life keep telling me maxplayers is set to 4 when i know it's not? (Version 1013 or lower)
 
This is a safety feature built into Half-Life that optimizes stability on machines with a small heap. Adding "-heapsize 32000" to the command line that you use to run the executable will fix this problem by overriding this feature. For instance, if you're using a shortcut to run Half-Life (or Rho-Bot) you can just right click on the shortcut, select properties, and change the 'Target:' field from 'C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\hl.exe' (or whatever it is on your system) to 'C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\hl.exe -heapsize 32000'.

You need to upgrade to Half-Life version 1.1.0.0 or higher.  The latest version is 1.1.0.8.

Yes, but the next problem is that the bots of each team look equal. 

Why?

What do you mean "equal"?

Is the number of members on each team the same (equal number of players on each time)?  If you are playing Half-Life deathmatch in teamplay mode then they are supposed to be equal and there's nothing you can do about it.  If you are playing some other MOD then you need to state which MOD you are playing (the settings for this are different for different MODs).

Or, if by "equal" you mean that all the players are using the same model (and thus all look the same), then you need to indicate what MOD you are playing and what commands you are using to add the bots (i.e. just "addbot" or "addbot 1", "addbot 2", etc. specifing the team number.  If you are adding all the bots using "addbot 1" they will all be on the same team, team number 1).
