I have recently loaded HPB bot on my server again, having not used it since about version 1.6. The main difference is I now use Admin Mod. Anyway it all seems to run ok except for a few little things that I am probably doing wrong:

1. The bots join and leave as they are supposed to, but thay are all the same model and colour - can I not make them select a random model when they join?

2. They will not shoot - I have tried the botdontshoot parameter on both 1 and 0 but it doesn't make any difference - what do I need to do differently?

Here's my config file for info:

# This is the HPB_bot.cfg file (for Half-Life deathmatch & teamplay)

pause 3

botskill 3

botdontshoot 0

bot_strafe_percent 20

min_bots 0
max_bots 4

bot_chat_percent 10
bot_taunt_percent 20
bot_whine_percent 10

bot_chat_tag_percent 80
bot_chat_drop_percent 10
bot_chat_swap_percent 10
bot_chat_lower_percent 50

bot_logo_percent 0
bot_reaction_time 2
random_color 1

Just one other thing - what's the correct waypoint file I should be using for crossfire? I seem to have a few in my maps folder:

crossfire.HPB_wp1  1053Kb  26/05/02
crossfire.HPB_wpt  21Kb    03/11/00
crossfire.wp1      1053Kb  12/05/01

Thanks

Once a bot spawns the first time, it will save the player model that it randomly picked when it joins the server.  This player model will be used again when the bot re-joins the server after being kicked.  If you only have one bot joining the server, it will always use the same model.  If you have more than one bot joining the server, they should all choose different models (and they will save what model they are using and re-use that model when re-joining after being kicked from the server).

I have no idea why bots would not be shooting at each other.  The only thing that should control this is the "botdontshoot" command.  Of course, they also won't shoot at each other if they are all on the same team.  Perhaps you have teamplay mode enabled and don't realize it (that would also make all the bots use the same model).  If you are running a dedicated server, check the sv_teamplay setting (make sure it's "0").  If you are creating a listen server, check the setting of the "Team play" check box in the Advanced Options screen (accessible from the Create game screen) and make sure it's not checked (it probably is).

Thanks botman - hit the mark again! I did have the teamplay set to 21 - not realising this would cause a problem. Status now: they all join using different random models, so that problem is solved. But they still don't shoot :( They are certainly more aggressive - aiming at each other and having 'in ya face' confrontations, but no-one goes for their guns. I'm convinced I must be doing something wrong but I have no idea what. Is there any other config file I should post to help?

Thanks

No, not that I can think of.  You might want to try removing the HPB bot then reinstalling it to see if that helps.

If that doesn't work, try uninstalling Half-Life, delete the Half-Life folder (to get rid of any remaining files), reinstall Half-Life, update to the latest version, then reinstall the HPB bot.  It should work fine then.

P.S. try things out with the default configuration BEFORE you change anything.

Groan... reinstall HLDS? Is that my only option? :(

No, you could try other bots instead.  See my "Links" page for the URL to other Half-Life bots.

Just a bit of feedback - I reinstalled HPB bot but there was no change. So I did what you advised - removed and reistalled HLDS and now everything works :) Thanks botman.
