Running an 18 player TFC on a RH Linux box with HPB_bot. My HPB_bot.cfg file in my tfc dir has the following lines:

max_bots 16
min_bots 0

Along with that, I have

addbot 1
addbot 1
addbot 2
addbot 2
addbot 1
addbot 1
addbot 2
addbot 2

Now, my problem is that when 16 real players come on, 2 of the bots don't leave and stick around, thus filling up the server with 16 humans and 2 bots. 

Any suggestions at all from anyone? 

Thanks

Other people have reported this problem also.  I believe that in those cases, the problem doesn't show up right away.  If I remember correctly, it seems to happen gradually after several map changes.  When the server was restarted, things would start working correctly again for a while.

Everytime a player joins the server, the HPB bot code is supposed to count the number of bots and players to see if more than the minimum number of bots is running on the server (in this case min=0).  One bot should get kicked off the server at this point.

If you originally spawned 8 bots, all 8 should get kicked off after 8 humans have joined.  When humans start to leave the server, the HPB bot code should automatically add a bot back to the server.  The bot code checks the total number of players every 5 seconds.

I suspect that during this 5 second period another human player joins the server and somehow the total number of players + bots gets out of sync.

I never was able to indentify what caused this bug and there's not much you can do to prevent this (other than manually kicking some bots off the server or periodically restarting the server).

You might try searching this forum for "max_bots" to see if there are any threads that give you any more information on this.

Great - thanks for the info, I'll try rebooting the server more often to see if that helps clear the situation.

Thanks again
