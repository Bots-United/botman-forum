I tried you HPB bot on Opposing Force and I first tried CTF... well they didn't get in. So I played regualr DM and they worked. When I tried a team game I put friendlyfire on and the scores were hidious. Anyways this next part is gonna turn into some bot coding help so I'll post it in the developer's forum. Nice bots though :)
