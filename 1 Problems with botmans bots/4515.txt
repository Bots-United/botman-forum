Why bots need waypoints?is it possible to write a 
script so bots 'explore' the map,find their target
(hosts/bomb area).
i played botmans bots on cs,they were ok.
the only thing i did not like is that guy making
wild 360 degrees flips and making headshot all faster than i could point my cross at him...he
was quite paranoid...

Because it is nearly impossible for a bot to interpret a map like a human being.

Waypoints, or something similar, are required for points that the bot knows where it can go. They are CPU efficient and are typically quick to load/save & create.

If we didn't give them waypoints, what could they do?

- Scan the area using tracelines:

PM (racc) and I've done this before with my bot when the bot doesn't have a waypoint so it can look for one. ;)

But it requires much CPU, i.e. slows down frame rate, trying to work out where it can go, and tracelines can only go straight ahead from a certain point.

You can't route this, unless you make the bot create waypoints on a successful walk around on where it wants to go.

- Read the map : Bsp File

Again PM has done this, I only got it to read the map but never used it.

There are disadvantages to this though. Moving things like lifts are sometimes difficult to work out, doors, locked doors, places where the bot has to jump & crouch, ladders are all difficult to know.

It is a good idea though since you dont need to waypoint and most of the map would be accessible to bots :)

But still requires large memory to hold the map info, and a small amount of time to work out the bots current position in the map

- Using waypoints:

Routes can be quick to work out (if you use a good algorithm)
You can have dynamic routes
Much less CPU to find current position (if you use good algorithm)...
Bots can interpret them easily :)

Ah I have to disagree !
On the contrary, moving things like lifts, doors, trains, bobbing platforms, ladders & co are MUCH easier if you use a good navmesh! By recording extra "reachability" flags like I'm doing I can virtually make the bot reach ANY position a human can, although I've not tried with gauss/rocket jumping but I think it is feasible too. FoXbot already does this, I've been told.

yea... I thought about "navmeshes";D But I don't have a clue what they're all about, I'm sure they're great and eveything, but difficult to implement unless you're a guru :) Well I think so anyway cause I never heard of them until botman talked about them, etc :)
