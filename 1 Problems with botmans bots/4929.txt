Just downloading and installed bubblemod, of which one of the changes to get BM to work is to change the +localinfo line on the server shortcut. By doing this BM loads up but the Bot doesn't coz the lines been edited. Anybody know if BM and the Bot can run on the server??

The HPB bot is designed to work only with Half-Life deathmatch, TFC, OpFor, Holy Wars, Deathmatch Classic, and CS 1.5 (but the bots won't buy weapons).  The HPB bot won't work with any other MOD.

I am running standard half life deathmatch. Or does running BubbleMod mean that I'm not?

I don't know what BubbleMod is.  If it's just a modification to standard Half-Life deathmatch, then the HPB bot might work fine with it (or it might not).

Bubblemod is a MetaMod plugin, which does some things such as show the amount of damage you've inflicted upon someone, changes the serverity of some of the weapons, etc. But to get it to load you have to change the Localinfo line on the shortcut (the one which loads the bot). Is it possible to load the Bot after the server is running?

No, if BubbleMod was written as a hook-type DLL (like the HPB bot) instead of a metamod plugin DLL, then you can't run it and the HPB bot at the same time.

Are you sure you can't run Bubblemod without using it as an Metamod plugin?

just take that localinfo line and put it in the autoexec.cfg file in your server's main valve folder... the same folder with the liblist.gam in it.

take the + out tho

it should be
localinfo mm_gamedll whatever
not
+localinfo...
