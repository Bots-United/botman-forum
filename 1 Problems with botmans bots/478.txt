Subject: Bots changing teams?

Ran a couple of HPB bots on a dedicated server last night, seemed to work fine for the hour or so I was playing (except for a lot of jumping and spinning which I understand is an FPS issue). I was running purely the Hunted map all night, had one bot set for the red team as a soldier, another as a red Medic. The level restarts every 45 min..

After I left (I checked the logs this morning) the bots were often playing as the wrong classes, and sometimes even playing as the Prez (blue team) or sniper (yellow). I like the bots, they're fun to play with when the server empties out, but I'm wondering why this would happen? Is there a setting in my .cfg files I should check?

Thanks for any help, and thanks for a great product!

Maybe if enough of us beg him, he will find a way for those of us that like to use the same exact bots every round and manually add the bots of our choice and have them stay the same round after round to have our way.  Please botman, there has to be a way, can't you make a setting that overides the random team choosing? Please, I like to be able to play round after round with the bots staying the same, if i want to play hunted maps, i create a cfg just for them, if i want to play sniper maps, i make a config, just for them. Surely i cannot be the only one who wants this.  By the way, here was the answer i got from botman, about the same i

umm, that didn't work like i wanted it to here is what he said regarding this issue


"Because with some maps supporting some classes and other maps supporting other classes (with different teams not necessarily having the same classes), you don't know ahead of time which classes will be valid for all maps that are in the mapcycle.txt file. 

For example, let's say the first map you play is PULL (team 1 is only civilian, team 2 is only snipers), then you switch to SNIPRWAR (both teams are only sniper), then you switch to 2FORT (no limits on classes on either team).  If the classes stay the same then no bots will join team 1 properly on the second map (because they are all trying to civilians again).  Even if I keep the original class and use that in subsequent maps, if possible, or chose something else if not.  By the time you've switched to 2FORT all the bots on the RED team will be snipers (because that's what they were originally) and the game will be unbalanced. 

The same thing happens with bots choosing the same team all the time.  If you start with a map with 2 teams, then switch to a map with 3 or 4 teams, there won't be anybody on the 3rd or 4th team. 

The only method that I could come up with that prevents these types of problems is to let them randomly choose the teams and classes at the start of each new map.  You can control what they use in the first map (and if you play ONLY that map then everything is like it was before), but when a map change occurs they will randomly select the team and class.  Sorry. 

One of the things I need to fix is making things so that they don't make the teams so lopsided.  Sometimes all of the bots will join the same team and there won't be ANY players on the other team(s).  I'll fix this problem in a future release."

OK, I get it, its a feature, not a bug :)

I too would like to be able to set the teams and classes and have them stay that way. 

In my case, running a Hunted only server, I figured that adding two permanent red team bots would give people a chance to get some sniper practice in when the server got quiet.

Its on my wish list. But if Botman has more important features to work on, I understand.

NO!! This is an important feature, it kind of turned me off from playing the bot so much.  I guess it was cutting into my work time a little but still.  I liked it a lot better before. I know maybe you can't please everyone, perhaps you can though, there has to be a way.

What I plan to do is have a bot.cfg for each map (like bot_2fort.cfg).  If it exists then it will be used to spawn bots on that particular map.  That way you can specify exactly which teams and classes you want the bots to be on for that map.  If the bot_mapname.cfg file doesn't exist then the bots will spawn the way they do now with random team and class.
