--------------------------------------------------
I just made a new waypoint file today for the map KingPin.bsp. Regular HLDM. I saved the waypoints and everything seemed fine.
Then I exited HL, did one minor adjustment in the HPB_bot.cfg file ("observer 1") and went back into HL to have a look at how the bots would play the first version of the new kingpin.HPB_wpt . However, when I got into the map (waypoint on / pathwaypoint on) it was as if the waypoint file didn't exist. The bots ran around without any guiding system, and I've spent most of the evening trying to find out what the problem could be. I have run other maps and the waypoints show up in them, so it seems likely that the HPB_bot just doesn't recognize the new waypoint file as a waypoint file.
I also run the Stripper2 and Monster plugins with map specific .cfgs, and those are working fine.

Where do I go from here ? Any suggestions ?

I'd prefer to find out what the problem is rather than starting from scratch, as I don't just run around with "autowaypoint on" when I make waypoints...

See if the .HPB_wpt file exists for that map in the MOD's maps folder.  If so, the HPB bot code should load it the next time that map is started.

It does exist in the MOD map folder. I've also experimented a bit with changing the name from kingpin.HPB_wpt to Kingpin, KingPin etc., but the bot just doesn't seem to find it. I even changed it to kingpin.wpt to see if HPB_bot read it (& convert it to .HPB_wpt), but there is no reaction to this specific waypoint file. Kind of puzzling, since all other waypoint files I have in the same directory work excellent.

Kind regards,

JMH

If you're running a Win32 server, the case in the filename won't matter.  If you're running a Linux server it will.  The filename should be lowercased mapname followed by .HPB_wpt, so if the BSP filename is KingPin.bsp, the waypoint file should be "kingpin.HPB_wpt" (which should be the way the waypoint editor saves the file when you use "waypoint save").

You might want to try renaming the .bsp file from KingPin.bsp to kingpin.bsp and see if that helps.  Other than that, I don't know what the problem might be.

I had a problem simular to that.

I downloaded a TFC map from WaypointWarehouse.com about a level with a train in it. Got the waypoints, changed them, and it wouldn't read them. I made sure the file was in the /tfc/maps folder.

I don't know why it wouldn't, so I deleted it. Apparently the waypoints where in a 'different format' then the HPB_bot could read it. Like a FoXBot waypoint file just renamed.

My advice to [TNF]JMH, if your positive that the waypoint file is there, try redoing the waypoints, saving it, and loading them. If it STILL doesn't read them, check it's file properties for anything in the meaning of Read Only and uncheck it. If that don't work... then I don't know. Like I said, it could be in a different format then the bot could read, even though it is HPB_bot waypoints.

I have a similar problem as well. I have tried everything to get a dustbowl waypoint to work but no matter what waypoint file I use, and I have 5 various ones, they follow the same lost pattern.

Most maps this is not a big deal, they do fairly well and since one is an engie and the other a med, they are valuable for getting health and armor from if nothing else.

On dustbowl and avanti though it is frustrating because they get the flag and then run around in respawn and cluelessly thoughout the map.

Later that night ... :)

Well, I have determined the problem... sorta. 

I noticed that all of a sudden the casbah bots were running around respawn aimlessly. On examination I noticed that I had replaced that waypoint with another I had downloaded from one of the waypoint sites.

I decided to do a little experimenting, replacing known working waypoint files (the ones that came with Botmans tar file of HPB_bot) quickly showed that NONE of these downloaded files worked... and I mean NONE!

I had got a number of regular map waypoint files as well some for most of our custom maps. Avanti and Dusutbowl did not come in the original HPB_bot tar and these were downloaded as well. 

Listen up folks, I don't know what the deal is with these waypoint sites giving away HPB waypoint files but NONE of about 20 I downloaded worked so don't waste your time!

Botman... why don't you make some for the standard maps that are missing? LOL, ok, that is asking a lot, I appreciate your HPB bots and know you are busy, how about anyone else? Does anyone have waypoint files that actually work with HPB bots?

I wish I had the time to make more waypoints files.

Actually, I wish I had the time to totally redo the waypoint system for the HPB bot.  I've learned quite a lot here at Gearbox working on the bots for Bond Nightfire and wish that I could take some of that code and add it to the HPB bot (including random path navigation).

Unfortunetly, all that code is owned by Gearbox and I couldn't release it as part of the HPB bot anyway.

Since I'm not updating the HPB bot anymore, I would recommend that you take a look a the FoxBot, if you haven't already done so.  It supports MANY more maps than the HPB bot does and it does a better job at handling maps that the HPB bot won't handle at all (stuff like capturing the points, etc.).  At least RedFox is still updating the FoxBot occasionally.  If you like both, you might want to try using the BotMixer5000 to run a mixture of HPB bots and FoxBots in the same map...

FOXbots are indeed smarter than HPBbots, I have noted that well when playing against them when I get the rare occasion to play on someone elses server.

However, FOXbots are not ported to Linux yet and I am beginning to wonder if they ever will be. I have been watching that forum for quite some time and even begged a couple of times but from what I can see it is clear there is no desire to port them over.

Awhile back I changed over to a system of individule cfg files for each map because auto kicking the bots was crashing our servers regularly. What I have done is just remove the bots on Avanti and Dustbowl, that seems to be the best solution for the time being. 

Thank you for your reply Botman.

I did find a site with working HPB waypoint files...

http://waypoint.myweb.nl/waypoint/frames/TFC.htm

You can trust the ones made by Cheesemonster and [Pizza]Monkey Boy, the rest of them I have had mixed results with.

FoXBot... their unhuman! I've played a few live TFC maps before with real players, and I've NEVER seen them move like the FoXBot does!

The problem I have with it is it's poorly designed botskill, even with a botskill of 5, they seem to be ignoring it and defaulting back to skill level 1.

For example;

addbot 2 10 Bot 5

Instead of that bot being worst skilled, it's BEST skilled. I've told Fox about this and he won't do anything about it.

Because of this, I'm playing the HPB_bot. At least a have a CHANCE of kicking their butts instead of being dead 30 seconds after I leave my spawn room! I mean they fire their shotguns with DEADLY aim at a distance! Jump and fill you with lead and I'm going "WHAT THE?????"

The ONLY thing I like is Medics come to you when you scream for 1. The HPB bot USED to have this feature before bots started attacking Sentry Guns. What happened?
