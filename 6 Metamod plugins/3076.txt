I'm not sure if you can do this with the standard Half-Life deathmatch code.  In the default deathmatch code, once you've spawned a weapon it will keep on respawning.

You would need to set the SF_NORESPAWN bit in the spawnflags key/value pair (SF_NORESPAWN is 1073741824) for the weapon when the weapon is spawned (this is what's used in single player to spawn a weapon only once).  You can do this with the Stripper2 config file, but the weapon would only spawn 1 time.

You would need some other entity that can spawn weapons with specified key/value pairs.  A monster_maker can't do this because you can't specify the spawnflag value for something when it spawns.  I'm not all that familiar with entities that can spawn other entities.  Maybe somebody more familiar with making Half-Life maps can help you.
