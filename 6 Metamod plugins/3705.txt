Is the cannon.mdl something I should be able to see in the pack viewers? Can someone post a link to download this or tell me where to find it please?

I think i know what your talking about, I renamed some model in the past and called it cannon.mdl and it was used as a turret model on my server neobots.d2g.com, its downloadable there if you wanted it, http://66.75.76.63/cannon.mdl
,other then that i dont understand what you are asking.
