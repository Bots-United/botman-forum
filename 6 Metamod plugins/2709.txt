Hi botman,

This Stripper2 add on is very cool.  I enjoyed all the "what the hell is that glowing thing?" comments from players on cs_assault.  

Anyway, i noticed that one of the new hostage locations, (the one in the corner by the back door on cs_assault) "rescues" the hostage when a player (CT) touches the hostage.  Did you see this happen also?

The other unexpected result, was that when creating new CT spawns, in areas that are not near the normal CT spawn location, the player can still buy as if in the "regular" spawn spot.  (I put one on top of the roof near the duct entrance)  Is this intentional, or does the spawn object bring the "buy" location with it?

(pardon my unfamiliarity with all the terminology)

One more question, is there a good way to place a spawn or teleport location within an enclosed area, (like the ducts on cs_assualt) without making the spawned player "stuck"?  Is this just a matter of refining the spawn coordinates or is there some other parameters to include in the config file entry?

I look forward to fooling about with this in other maps as time permits.

Perhaps we can have a forum thread for map specific config files, as its quite time consuming to run around the map and id all the coordinates.

but thanks again, I think this may add some neat features to spice up the maps.

The stuff in the example .cfg files was just for example.  I don't know if they work correctly as far as normal hostage behaviour goes or not.  You may have to experiment with other locations in the maps until you get the desired/expected behaviour.  (i.e. I didn't test ANY of this stuff in an actual game with other players).

When I ran my bsp_tool on the cs_assault map...

bsp_tool -ent cs_assault > cs_assault.txt

...I didn't find ANY entities in there that looked like they were BUY zones.  I know that there is a "func_buyzone" entity in the Counter-Strike mp.dll file (run the entities.exe executable on the mp.dll file to see this), but I don't see any func_buyzone entities in the cs_assault map.  I'm guessing that func_buyzone was once used by mappers to create explicit buy zones for players.  If the map doesn't contain any func_buyzone entities then Counter-Strike must create them dynamically (I presume some small area around the spawn point).  I noticed when creating other spawn points that a buyzone that works from one spawn point doesn't show up from another spawn point (i.e. spawn and look where the buyzone is, use "kill" to kill yourself, then quickly run to the first spawn point, you may or may not have a buyzone there).

You don't want to place spawn points or teleport points within small enclosed spaces because the player would normally have to crouch to get in there.  You can't force a player to crouch.  If you spawn a player (or teleport them to somewhere) where they are touching ANY surface, they will get stuck and can't move!!!  Only spawn (or teleport them) to places where there's plenty of room on all sides and above and below them.  Make sure the spawn points are about 40 (or more) units off the ground for spawn points and teleport locations.

If you want to post some sample .cfg files for various maps (especially good player spawn point changes), feel free to do so.  That's why I created a separate area in my forum for Stripper2 stuff, so that people could post examples of what they have done in various maps.  If enough people want to e-mail their .cfg files to me, I can put them all together in a .zip file collection and people can download them from my website (just don't forget to put your name and e-mail in the comments of the .cfg file so people can contact you if they have problems with it).

Correct, I think it was invented for the escape map mode a long time ago. If there's no func_buyzone specified on a map, the spawning area will be used instead. Same with func_rescue zones btw.

Hmm, CF has time to read Botman's forums?  Wouldn't your time be better spent porting the PODBot to Linux so I could stop trying to bribe Botman with huge sums of cash to add CS features to the HPBbot? (hehe)
