I think it's monster, but im not sure. My hlds crashes and i get one these two messages:



1) The instruction at "0x01402817" referenced memory at "0x04a04ac0". The memory could not be "read".

2) SZ_GetSpace: Tried to write to an uninitialized sizebuf_t: ???

"SZ_GetSpace: Tried to write to an uninitialized sizebuf_t"

This message is almost always caused by something trying to send a network message to a bot.

Are you running bots on your server (or fakefull plugin)?  Are you running metamod (or any other) plugins?

If the answer to both of these questions is YES, you should first try enabling bot protection in metamod (see the documents on the metamod site for details on this).

If that doesn't work, you should remove the plugins one by one until you find the plugin that's causing that crashing problem and stop using that plugin.

Alternately, you can stop running bots on your server.

(Also you might want to search this forum for "unitialized sizebuf_t" to find similar posts from people who have had this problem before).

To the best of my knowledge, there is no way that the Monster plugin by itself can cause this error.

Alright, well what about the other one?

The instruction at "0x01402817" referenced memory at "0x04a04ac0". The memory could not be "read".

That's a memory access problem.

It could be related to ANY code that is running as part of the dedicated server (the engine, metamod, plugins, etc.).

If you've changed anything recently, undo you changes by going back to what you had before.  If you've changed more than one thing, try taking them out one by one until you don't see that error anymore.

The memory problem may take a LONG time to show up again, so you may have to run your server for days or weeks to be sure that you've removed the code that was causing the problem.
