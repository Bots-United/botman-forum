ok. first I'd like to say this is the best thing I've ever got for half-life and cstrike. Adding weapons and hostages are fun.

I have problems with func_wall or other funcs. I can't get them to work cause i have no clue how to set them up.

I look at maps through bsp_tool and i found something like this.

classname/func_wall
renermode/4
renderamt/255
model/*9

First what does renermode and renderamt do.
Also what does *9 mean. How can u set how big the wall is. And last, how do you choose the texture.

I'm just a n00b.

You can't change the texture (it's part of the brush info that is compiled into the BSP file).

See this thread for more info on brush models...

Experiment with the key/value settings to see what they do.  Also look in the .fgd file for some explainations and take a look at Half-Life mapping tutorial sites for more details.
