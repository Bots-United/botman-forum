Just two questions:
In day of defeat, does anyone know if its possible to spawn control points (Flags)using stripper2!? If so, Would they function normally?

And I'm having trouble understanding how to spawn weapons and such, what would this need to look like in order to spawn a Tommy gun, for example:

[add]
{
   classname/weapon_thompson
   PRECACHE_MODEL models/?_tommy.mdl
   angle 45
   model/models/thompson.mdl
   delay 0
   origin/x y z
}

I know theres three different models for each weapon, (p,v, and w) but I have no clue which is for what so I don't know what to precache and which model to spawn.. Also when I go to precache something, does it have to look like this?
PRECACHE_MODEL(whereever/something.mdl)
Or can I do this?
PRECACHE_MODEL whereever/something.mdl
Reason being is when I use the first one, game crashes to desktop, and the other does nothing.

Thanks for any help, it would be appreciated!

The p_ models are the player models (this is what other player see you holding).  The v_ models are the view models (this is what you see in your hands when you are holding that weapon).  The w_ models are world models (which is what you see lying on the ground).  You want the w_ model.

Yes, you need to use the '(',')' when precaching sprites, models, and sounds.  Perhaps you didn't have the directory name or filename correct in the Stripper2.cfg file.

For models, make sure you have PRECACHE_MODEL(models/model_file_name.mdl), and NOT PRECACHE_MODEL(model/model_file_name.mdl), without the 's' in "models".

I still can't get a weapon to spawn! Why!?! I know my stripper2 works because I can strip out water and add spawn points, but I can't add sprites or models for the life of me!

[add]
{
   classname/weapon_thompson
   PRECACHE_MODEL(models/w_tommy.mdl)
   angle 45
   model/models/w_tommy.mdl
   delay 3
   origin/545 2891 -423
}
Game doesn't crash now with the ('s but Shouldn't this work? I've tried lots of different things but nothing works for me, what am I doing wrong?
Thanks

You don't need the PRECACHE_MODEL line, the model line, or the angle line.

{
   classname/weapon_bar
   origin/2328 3439 228
}

is all you need

in dod, useable weapons are a map entity, and need to be spawned as such. They do not need to be specified with a model, since a weapon_thompson knows what model to use.
