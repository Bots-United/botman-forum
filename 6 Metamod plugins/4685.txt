I'm using msvc++. I opened up the project file and went to the additional include line. The directory I use for my sdk is:

d:\games\sdk\sdk\sourcecode

So I changed the four directories to be:

d:\games\sdk\sdk\sourcecode\pm_shared
d:\games\sdk\sdk\sourcecode\engine
d:\games\sdk\sdk\sourcecode\dlls
d:\games\sdk\sdk\sourcecode\common

When I compile it gives me all kinds of errors. Any idea why?

EDIT: I opened the dsp file and found the 6 or so include lines and made them the correct dir. Now when I compile I get about 20 errors telling me it can't open 'extdll.h'. I looked in the project file with the "external dependencies" and it appears in the list. I can even open and view it. What could be going on?

EDIT again: I went back into the file and fixed the locations again so that I'm sure they are correct. Now I get about 400 and some odd errors with the compile. Is there a beginner tutorial to setting up the sdk anywhere? I've been relying off of the search button on these forums...

Final edit: I was using an older sdk. I downloaded the one suggested in the metamod help files and it worked.
