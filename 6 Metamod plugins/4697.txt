In your server you had it to where if you kill monsters and they killed you it would register the kill and say what you killed ect...ect...
 
How did you do it and can you post the config with the commands please ? thanks

In order to register the monster kills I modified the monster code in the SDK. It was not too difficult once I found Handy Vandal's tutorial and some guidance from the people here at botman's forums. I can post it if you are interested or provide a dll if you email me privately.
