Why not use...

sound/hgrunt/ass!.wav

...instead of the 'message' tag?

Also, I don't think hgrunt/ass!.wav is a looping wave file, so it will only play the sound once.

You'll never hear the sound unless you change it to a looping sound.  Download GoldWave (from www.goldwave.com) to create loop tags inside .wav files.  Then the sound should play in a loop over and over again.

P.S. "ASS!" played over and over sound REALLLY annoying and I would probably never come back to a server that did this.  You might want to add about 5 seconds of silence onto the end of the wave file and make that a looping sound.  At least that wouldn't be quite so annoying.

I've never used goldwave before.  I know that you can set the beginning and ending locations in the wave sound where you want a loop.

Search through the Help documentation for goldwave for "loop".  Maybe that will help.

you can also use a multi manger and a trigger relay to loop a sound. ie: something triggers the multi manager, a button or whatever, I like to use a trigger auto with a name of game_playerjoin and a taget name of your multi manager this starts the sound when you join the game.then add the target name of the sound entity to the multi_manager with a slight delay say 1, then add the name of your trigger_relay with a delay that is just a tad longer then the length of the play time of the .wav now make the target of the trigger relay the name of your multi_manager.
viola, easy :)
I use this method to loop all kinds of things, lights on and off in a sequence, sprites, walls, works like a champ.

I copied this from one of my bsp's
you get the idea though. the trigger auto triggers the multi manager at map start.  notice that in the multi manger you have to turn the sound on and then back off (it has to be turned off after it is done playing or it causes problems) the rocker and rocker#1 triggers, inside the multi manager, are both tageting the ambient generic, this is a little confusing because rocker1 is the target name of the multi manager, where rocker#1 is just the second instance of the same trigger inside the multi manager. the trigger relay is triggered .1 seconds after the sound is turned off by the multi manager, the relay then triggers the multi manager again starting the whole process over(loop) you can tweak the delays to refine them for your own needs.

The only one that matters is where the wav is located and then only if it dosen't have the play everywhere flag on. otherwise they can be anywhere inside the bsp

Use 2 configs one for each .wav
:)
I tried to find an easier way, sorry for the confusion, a lot of head scratching went into that on my part too, hehe

Oh sorry
you would have to change all the targets and targetnames also the wav name of course.
just put a 1 in front of all the targetnames and targets that should work
