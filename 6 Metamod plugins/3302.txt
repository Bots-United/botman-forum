If the map has its own .cfg, the monsters spawn by themselves, but I can't spawn any monsters using the "monster" command or view the listing with the "monster" command. Also, the banner doesn't show up with the server loading, kind of like it didn't load. Something loaded though, because it does spawn monsters, if you have the .cfg with that certain map. Not sure if the plugin uses a trackerUI.dll file, but it says that failed to load during server connect.

i can't get the monster command to work either.  also, when extracting the files into your mod directory, are u supposed to use the path names that come with the zip files?  for instance, each file has a path name of /monster_plugin.

thanks

The .zip file will extract to a directory called "monster_plugin".  See the ReadMe.txt file in there for installation instuctions.  Just unzipping the file does NOT install the plugin.  You have to copy the .dll file to your MOD's dlls folder before the plugin will start working (or be updated to the latest version which supports the "monster" command).

yuppers...i copied each file to where it needs to be.  i've followed the readme file as best as i could. i already have metamod b/c of adminmod that i have installed.

here's what i did:
i added the dll to my cstrike\dlls.
added win32 dlls/monster_mm.dll to metamod.ini.
added a fy_iceworld_monster.cfg to my cstrike\maps folder with monster configs.
added monsterskill.cfg to the cstrike folder.

when i start the server, i do get the monster banner but still the monster commands do not work. 

did i leave anything out or forget to do something?

Show what's in your fy_iceworld_monster.cfg file.

I don't see any problems with that .cfg, it should work just fine.

Did you try enabling the monster_log cvar as described in the ReadMe.txt file?  Turn on logging for your server ("+log on" on the command line, or "log on" in server.cfg or autoexec.cfg).  Start the server with the map you want and check the "logs" directory of the MOD directory for recent .log files.  Search those for "[MONSTER]" error mesages.

I had that problem too, I think here's the prob - were you were using admin mod?  That's what I was doing and it wouldn't work, but then I realized that when I type monster blah blah into the console it works fine...so I wrote a monster plugin for admin mod - you can get it here
http://www.top-cs.com/files/plugin_monster_mod.zip

It'll be updated continually, I'll be watchin the monster mod development - yes, this has been tested on my server, so I know it works too.

here are the basic commands you can do with it (more will be added later):

admin_monster <monster> <player> execs monster <monster> <player> and shows a csay message

admin_torture <monster> <player> does the same, but buries the player first (makes for some angry players :) )

admin_torture2 <monster> <player> is the same as admin_torture, but adds an extra monster for more fun

admin_monster_spawn controls monster_spawn cvar

are you sure you have precached the monsters you are trying to spawn?
