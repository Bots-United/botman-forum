Metamod program that changes the mapcycle by the day.

Yes I'm well aware that both statsme and clanmod can do this, but I really dislike the DM behavior that Statsme causes and I don't have enough time to fiddle with configuring clanmod or statsme to turn off all bells and whistles that the two server side addons have.

(Sorry Buzz, good job though)

I'd be intrested in a stand allone metamod plugin that changes maps depending on the day of the week. Easy to configure (eg: macycle_sun.txt, mapcycle_mon.txt etc).

At the moment we're doing this manualy with mapcyclefile. And it isn't too bad to do it every night... hmm
