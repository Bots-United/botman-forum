i understand that stripper2 is for spawning things and stripping other things before a map is loaded (not on the fly).  but what i really want to do is spawn weapons on the fly into peoples hands... kinda like the old give cheat command (by the way it doesnt work anymore).  so ive been searching the net looking for a mod (preferably a meta mod plugin) that will allow me to spawn things (weapons).  however i have had no luck (give doesnt work, and admin mods admin_spawn hasnt worked from version 2.50.00). i dont expect anyone here to give me a mod that does spawn things on the fly; actually that brings me to my question.

the surprising lack of a mod that spawns weapons (or just things in general) makes me wonder if there is a technological reason why no one has made such a mod.  but i know that the monster command in botmans monster mod can spawn any of the precached monsters on the fly.  so all i want to know is: is it possible for 
someone to make a meta mod plugin that can spawn the cached entities in the game on the fly?  i just want to know if i should keep looking or if i should stop because its not possible to do what i want.

It is completely possible to spawn weapons that are native to a MOD.  It should be fairly trivial for someone with metamod experience to create a plugin that will allow you to spawn a weapon directly over a player's head (when the weapon drops down it will touch the player, thus giving it to him).

If some one triggers something, a monstermaker could spawn a weapon... Correct me if I'm wrong.
But then a player must be in a certain place.. Well it's an idea..

Yes, I don't see any reason why a monster maker couldn't spawn a weapon.

You could place the monster maker above a button and have a sign (sprite) that says "Press Here For Weapon".  Pushing the button would trigger the monster maker and cause it to start spitting out weapons (see the monster maker in snark pit for a button triggered entity).

thanks for all the input guys...

ACO: adminOp looks really cool... but it looks like its for TFC. i forgot to mention that im running a CS server.

botman/Christopher: thats an idea that i would be willing to work with. so would i be able to spawn one of these monster makers with stripper2?

thanks,

There's an example of a monstermaker spawning snarks in the crossfire_str.cfg file included with Stripper2 as an example.  Take a look at it.  Try changing monster_snark to "weapon_rpg" (or whatever).

You can use ripent (from Zoner's Half-Life Tools, ZHLT) or my BSP tools utility to dump the entities contained in a BSP file (for example to look at the monstermaker in the Half-Life deathmatch map snarkpit.bsp).

Visit some mapping tutorial websites and that will help you understand how you are supposed to hook all these entities together (like how to get a trigger to cause something to happen, etc.).
