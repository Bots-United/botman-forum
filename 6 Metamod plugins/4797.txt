I'm trying to make an m4 in the spa in cs_militia. I made cs_miltita_str.cfg, added the [add] section, and set it up with classname weapon_m4a1 using the origin gotten from AdminMod, but alas no gun shows up when i run. Im sure stripper is running because i see the banner on startup.

Ahh thanks. Another problem was that I didnt read ReadMe.txt throroughly enough and missed the part about copying map_str.cfg into the maps folder, but the armoury_entity thing would have come up anyway.
