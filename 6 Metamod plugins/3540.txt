How do you get HPB bot and Monster plug in to work at the same time?

Install the HPB_Bot first, then install monster plugin with metamod properly (so it overwrites the liblist.gam file with metamod as the game dll) and when you load up Half-Life, add "+localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_Bot.dll" to your Half-Life command line... 

Example:

"hl.exe -game cstrike -console +localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_Bot.dll"

(or in linux)

"hlds_l -game cstrike +localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_Bot_i486.so"

Would you need to do this for any bot?, Because the bots work, but the monster never did.

The only bot that this won't work for is RACC because it attempts to load metamod after the bot code has been loaded.

If you are using any other bots, you should use the "localinfo" method of loading the bot DLL.
