Ok, I made a jail in well. Its cool but I don't want it to come every map change. I want to set it so that 25% of the time the jail will be loaded. I can do something like:

{
origin/0 0 0   // Can be any number
classname/func_wall
}25%

Or whatever. But that will only spawn one wall. I need 4. So if I do that 4 times:

{
origin/0 0 0   // Can be any number
classname/func_wall
}25%
{
origin/0 0 0   // Can be any number
classname/func_wall
}25%

And so on, 4 times. The chances of them all spawning at once arn't good. So  is there a way to make the whole thing spawn 25% of the time? Not just bits and pieces?

I hope this makes sence.

Thanks for your help.

Try this,

code:

 {
  { 
   origin/0 0 0   // Can be any number 
   classname/func_wall 
  } 
  { 
   origin/0 0 0   // Can be any number 
   classname/func_wall 
  } 
  { 
   origin/0 0 0   // Can be any number 
   classname/func_wall 
  }
 }25%

No, you can't group entities so that they either ALL spawn or NONE of them spawn.  To do that you would need to be able to nest grouped entities (the three level thing talked about in the ReadMe.txt file).

There currently isn't any way to do what you want using Stripper2.

If i'm not mistaken, this will cause ONLY ONE of the 4 walls to spawn 25% of the time...

Correct, 25% of the time ONE of those 3 will spawn.

Again, there currently is NO WAY to group entities together and spawn ALL of them or spawn NONE of them.
