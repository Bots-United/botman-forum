I run monster on my cstrike server and when it crashes It causes hlds to stop responding and a windows error comes up, so instead of being able to be automatically restarted with serverdoc, I have to close the program by clicking on the dialog box, is there a way I can set it so when it crashes it can just stop and then autorestarted by serverdoc?
