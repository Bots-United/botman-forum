Ok recently i have noticed my hlds freezes, and closes, fatal error when its the end of the round, and it trys to reload(same map). When i start the hlds for the first time, it works without problems, but EVERY time it goes for map change, it crashes. Anyone run into this problem?
if so, any solutions?
