If you are on the console, you type...

monster monter_barney playername

...where "playername" is the name of the player you wish to spawn Barney next to.

You will have to edit the monster_precache.cfg file before starting the MOD if you want to spawn monsters on the fly.  See the ReadMe.txt file included with the Monster plugin for more details.
