I added a team to 2fort in TFC. It consist of only civilians, and i want there to be a reward for killing him. Is there away, like in hunted?

Take a look at the map "Pull" for TFC.

I looked at it,but all i see is a reg. tf_goal for the flag(soccerball), that rewards team with 10 pts. Is there a way to give the team AND player points for killin him? like if someone would normally cap a flag in 2fort?. Also, what about when the civilians kill ppl, is there away to give them more frags than normal, say 5 or so.

Ummmm, it sounds like you are looking at "Push" (not Pull).

Pull is a map where civilians are flung up into the air and snipers (on the other team) try to kill them.  If a civilian escapes, they get a point.  If the sniper kills the civilian, they get a point.

there is a setting called "frags"

so in a tfgoal you would put

frags/10  (for 10 points)

You have to give each civilian an invisible tfgoal item, set it so the goal is dropped when the civilian dies, and make the goal trigger another goal when dropped. The goal that the first goal triggers will be the one that actually gives frags, displays messages etc.

When the item is removed from the civilian, you need to place it in a position that the civilian _has_ to walk over (to ensure that it will be picked up), be it a corridor that leads out of respawn or whatever. Also be sure to not allow civilians to pick up more than one invisible item, and make sure there are enough items, so each civilian gets one.

Its not that hard to implement with a little thought, theres probably better ways of doing it, but none come to mind as I type this.

That's how it's done on Hunted.  Civi picks up item_tfgoal where he spawns.

Thanks, it all makes sense now.
When i think about it, if by death the certain team gets the frags, then it wouldnt matter who killed him.. so if a fellow civilain killed him, then the points would still goto the red or blue team, who ever i declair. is there away around this? So that who infact killed him, gets lets say 50 frags, and his team, gets 10? i know its same question, maybe theres another way because i think this way may be too limited for my needs
i also want there to be points awarded to the civilians if they kill a red or blue team
