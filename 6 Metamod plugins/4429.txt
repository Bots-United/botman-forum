Does DoD have a "monster_furniture" entity (most MODs do).  If so, you could try using that with a model file (*.mdl).

Yeah, okay.  TFC definitely has "monster_furniture" entities.

well i got it to work, i made it a item_tfgoal for team 3... so there is no team 3 or 4 in the map.. the bots ignore it.. and i set the goal activation to 812 (solid) .. and it works..

:o)
