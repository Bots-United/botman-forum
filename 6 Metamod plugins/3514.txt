Stripper3? Is that available?  I see it nowhere on this site and a google search for 'stripper3' resulted in a picture of a fat guy in a g-string.

I don't know of any Stripper3 (sounds like someone created a nice virus to send your CD key to an e-mail address).

Thank you Python!  A real response instead of jackass replys.  Yes, that is exactly what I'm talking about.  Cause by the names I've seen here we have "stripper", "stripper2", and "Stripper 3".  We obviously know that stripper has been replaced by stripper2, but what is stripper 3?    

This link to YOUR downloads page Botman is where I found the link below it.  Am I high on crack in a time rift or what?

The Stripper utility (not the Stripper2 metamod plugin) had several different versions.  Version 3 of the Stripper utility was the last version of it that I did.  Stripper will only support Half-Life deathmatch, my Bot Number 10, Jumbot and the Phineas bot.  No other MODs are supported by Stripper.

A year or so later, I created Stripper2 which was an advanced version of Stripper.  Stripper was a server hook type DLL (much like the HPB bot) and only supported a few MODs.  Stripper2 is a metamod plugin and supports every single MOD that metamod supports (including TFC, Counter-Strike, DoD, DMC, Frontline Force, HolyWars, etc.).

You should NOT be using Stripper (any version) since this is an OLD utility and is mainly on my website for archival purposes.  You should be using Stripper2 (Version 1.0) which does all of the things that Stripper did plus more.

ok. thanks.  It isnt exactly clear on your site about the differences between stripper 2 and 3.  We didnt write it, so us "end users" have no idea unless you post that kind of info.

... I had absolutly no problem figuring it out, and by the number of people who seem to know what they're doing with it, I'd assume that very few people have not been able to figure it out.

Good job Botman :)
