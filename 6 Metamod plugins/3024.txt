Subject: Getting Map Coordinates

I have tried to get map coordinates using the console 'status' method but the coordinates always come up 0,0,0...has anyone seen this and is there something I can do to fix it?

Thanks,

Unless you have rcon access to the server I think it shows that. Make a listen server and do it or if you have rcon try 'rcon status'

Yes, the dedicated server status will always show (0,0,0) as the location since you aren't really a player in the game.  Just connect to your dedicated server using a client on the same machine (if it's running on Windows).  Use "+port XXXXX" (where XXXXXX is something different from the default of 27015) on the command line when starting the Half-Life client.  For example...

hl.exe +port 27099

If you have adminmod you can do "admin_userorigin <target>" which will return coordinates :).

By far the best way to get exact coordinates is to decompile the map and find the coordinates with worldcraft :).

Or if you have AdminOP, you can use admin_testme command :)

another way is to use botmans BSP viewer and load the map you want, it will view the co-ordinates the camera is at

I've been unable to get the BSP viewer to work. I always get the error 'cant find half-life\valve directory!

And yes I've checked the bsp_view.cfg file repeatedly to ensure $halflife_dir points to the correct spot. I even went so far as to copy HL to C:\SIERRA\Half-Life to see if that would help to no avail.

It's looking for a "liblist.gam" file in the Half-Life\valve directory.  I think the retail version of Counter-Strike does not have this file.  You can copy the one from the cstrike directory into the valve directory if the file does not exist.

It's not that simple. I notice the error message is a little different than if I put an actual 'wrong' path in there. I do have the liblist.gam file in there, and I'm running regular HLDM, not CS.

Did you try matching the case of the target path? I doubt that would help, but its the only diffrence I see.

d:\programs\games\halflife might work if it matched the case, D:\Programs\Games\halflife\ ?

Yes, I tried that. I think the problem has little, if anything to do with the path.

I reinstalled the old original half-life from CD on a test system and the bsp tools work. I think the tools are either dependent on an earlier version than my 1109, or are looking for a registry entry that isn't on my game system. I may have copied the HL directory from another machine and thus may not have all the registry entries. I do play HL every day so it works fine.

I've been unable to get the BSP viewer to work. I always get the error 'cant find half-life\valve directory! 

The source for BSP_view, in file config.cpp, in the function
HANDLE FindDirectory(HANDLE hFile, CHAR *dirname, CHAR *filename)

has this code:
while (pFindFileData.dwFileAttributes != FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY)

dwFileAttributes is a bit mask and needs to be tested by anding the bit you want to test for.

(lpFindData->dwFileAttributes & FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY) != 0
 
BSP_view as it is right now will never work with a retail install of counter strike no matter what you put in the config file.  On a really quick review of the source I don't see how it manages to work with a half-life install!

P.S.
Botman - thanks much for Stripper2 !
It is super!!!

Ahhh!  Yes, that's true.  I wondered why so many people with Win2K had problems with it not finding the valve directory.  Thanks for finding that bug.

The only way it will work is if none of the other bits for that directory are set (i.e. NOT hidden, NOT read-only, NOT system, etc.), then it will work (at least on Win98 it will anyway).

I'll fix that bug and release a new version of the BSP tools.

Sorry to resurrect such an old post, but how would I go about changing the source for BSP_View, to fix this bug ?

The bug is already fixed in the latest version of the BSP tools (BSP_slicer.exe, BSP_tool.exe and BSP_view.exe).

Just make sure you've downloaded BSP tools Version 1.0 and you're all set.

The only thing available at the download page is 
"Source code to the BSP tools (Beta version 0.4)" 

And it still has this problem.

config.cpp, in the function 
HANDLE FindDirectory

while (pFindFileData.dwFileAttributes != FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY)
{

How would I download the version 1.0 source?
