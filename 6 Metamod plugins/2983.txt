Does anyone know how to insert the user name who activated a trigger into a broadcast message?

Here is what i want to do

{ 
   classname/info_tfgoal
   origin/0 0 -50
   broadcast/<UserNameHere> has the earned a 5 point bonus\nby leaping over the -=[MMM]=-!
   message/You jumped the sign
   g_e/1
   goal_no/58
   goal_activation/5 //all classes able to acviate, except the playerclass(pyro)
   frags/5 //score added to activating player
   health/10000
   armorvalue/10000 //percentile of armor given, or lost
   goal_max/100 25 25
   goal_min/-100 25 -15
   playerclass/7
   wait/30
   invisible_finished/60
   super_damage_finished/60
   speak/vox/endgame.wav
}

username needs to be %s, but I have no clue how to get it to say who %s is :). Check out this place, http://dynamic3.gamespy.com/~st/forum/index.php?board=8 mapping help message board, they'll tell you how :).

Your armor percent should only be 100. Can't go any higher then 100%.

The only way I can think of doing it is to give everyone a flag when they spawn. The flag will trigger the message which should broadcast the user name.

Thank you... I looked in titles.txt and they use %s but there has to be something defining what %s is. I tried scripting methods that are used in other types of scripting. and none worked.. Thanks again IVIaniac
