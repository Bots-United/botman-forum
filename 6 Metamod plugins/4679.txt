is there a way to fix it so a flagcarrier can not use the teleporters when he's carring the flag ?

I assume you mean in TFC.

In the future be sure to include which MOD you are talking about so that people don't have to guess.

P.S. I doubt TFC teleports support the ability to restrict which class can use them, but I don't know for sure.  Looking at the trigger_teleport class in the TFC FGD file would tell you for sure.  You could also look at TFC mapping tutorial websites to see if anyone shows how to restrict which classes can use teleporters.

If you use an info_tfgoal to set off the teleport you can tell it to not work if a player is carying a certain item, thats if you know what the map calls the flag.
