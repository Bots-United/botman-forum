i was wondering, how do you get acutal coordinates for buttons on the wall? I have used the getpos function in admin mod however the button is never on the wall. Also when i try to put a spray/text/button model on the wall it does not show up. How do you get the coordinates? Im still a noob at this heh. Also i still have not been able to get the light entity to spawn at all.

You pull down the console and enter...

status

...and press return.  This will show you the X, Y and Z coordinates of where you are in the map.  The coordinates will be at the center of your body so you will have to add a little to the X or Y coordinate to reach the wall.  See the ReadMe.txt file for a very detailed explanation of this.
