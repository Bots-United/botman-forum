As a long time "hunted" player, I thought it would be cool to give the Prez a knife instead of an umbrella. Sure enough, following the guidelines in the "TFC, sniper rifles for everybody!" thread, it was easy enough to give the prez a tf_weapon_knife. For whatever reasons though, the civilian's knife kills no faster than his umbrella (I think the knife in a spy's hands does 3X the damage of a crowbar/umbrella), and does not seem to have the spies' "in the back" ultra-damage.

Is there something I'm missing, or is the knife's special properties in the spies' hand just part of the spy code and not the knife code? Any way to fix this?

A tf_weapon_medikit in the civilian's hands works normally. Maybe a spanner for the medic so he can boost armor too ...

On a few hunted servers we have played with giving the prez quad damage, but the quad glow and sound is as much a hindrance as it is a help. I was hoping the knife would be a way around this.

Knife does little damage unless its a back stab. 

Edit:
Ooh nevermind. I'm not sure why that's not working... when we used to mess around with sv_cheats 1 and then limiting what weapons could be given with adminmod we never noticed any problems with the knife in the hands of the civilian... or for that matter any class.

Been doing a little more testing, even with cheats the knife in the civilian's hands does not do the same damage as when used by a spy. A spy can take a sniper down in 3 hacks (one to the back), for a civilian it takes 8 or so (same as umbrella). I am also convinced that a civilian cannot store any ammo, the only weapons that work for him are ones that keep some ammo in a "clip", like a shotgun or rpg. I tested this both with sv_cheats and the added entities  method, if I am overlooking something let me know.

I have always avoided digging into the .dll code (because even thinking about it makes my brain hurt!), but to do the things I am thinking of I may have to.

A quick wish list for the civilian:
More damage with no glow, maybe some armor, possibly immunity to the autorifle. Before I get too deep into this, are these possible with some server side .dll doctoring?

You could check if the civilian has his fire button held down and is lined up close enough to stab the player and drain health from the player every so often to give the effect of a more powerful hit perhaps. Hardly perfect but could be made to work.
