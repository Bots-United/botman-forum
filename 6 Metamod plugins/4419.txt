Hi,

Was wondering if it is possible to re-enable buying on a map which has it disabled.

I run a warcraft3 mod server and use the Lord of the Rings map pack on it.  Unfortunately all of them are just shotgun only maps.  I want to enable buying of weapons on them if possible.  Is this something that I could do with stripper?

Do I just need to add buyzones to the maps or is there another setting I could modify via stripper?

Any help or suggestions appriciated.

If, which I doubt, there are buyzones you can enable buying other wise you cant because buyzones are brush entitys which you cant make via stripper.

OK thanks.

I got a mate looking into it to see if he can mod it with some map making utils.

This is easy to fix. You need to change, or just remove the following entity:

{
"origin" "763 -601 64"
"bombradius" "500"
"buying" "3"
"classname" "info_map_parameters"
}

Also I think they changed the way buy zones work in some version and you always spawn in a buy zone even if one isn't specified.
