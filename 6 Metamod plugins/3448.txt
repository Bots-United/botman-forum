Botman, I don't know if you have this in mind or not, but I was wondering if monsters can be cached on the fly, in the middle of a map.  I use Monster in CS, and some maps act a little strange when some of the more complex monsters, like agrunts, are loaded.  One instance, is the bridge in de_aztec.  It is still usable, but the texture is gone (invisible.)

I would like to be able to cache or uncache monsters on the fly, so I can player spawn them.  I have no idea, however, if this is possible without a complete map change, so I just thought I would ask.

Thanks,
Crazy

PS - Awesome plugin, thanks!

No, monsters (and other entities) cannot be cached once the map is loaded and clients are connected.

The problem is that clients get sent a list of precached entities when they connect to the server.  You have to have an entity precached on the client in order to display it.  The engine won't let you precache something on the client once the client has connected to the server and spawned into the game.
