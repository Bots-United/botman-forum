I'm having some problems with monster mod. I know it's setup correctly to work with another plugin (Superhero mod an AMX plugin). One of the pwers makes Snarks attack a player. Though the problem is, nothing of the monster mod comes up in console at startup AND no commands work. I installed it the way the directions said to but i installed it though metamod which was in the addons directory instead of just in the regular CS directory. I'm not sure if that's a problem, but it's helpful to know i guess. 

Thanks

The newer versions of metamod want plugins installed in the 'addons' folder instead of in the MODs 'dlls' folder.  That's fine.

If you aren't seeing the [MONSTER] output in the server .log file then the plugin isn't being loaded.  You can try to manually load the plugin (see the metamod documentation for details) to see if that works.  If so, then you just don't have something correct in the metamod config files that specify which plugin is to be loaded (and from where it gets loaded).

Ok, now i'm gonna sound like a total noob idiot. I'm sorry, but i have to. I read all the config files for Metamod and such. I tried loading the mod manually. Yet for some reason none of the commands to do so work for Meta mod either. I bought this server from recon gamer so it's not run from anywhere around me, i'm just logging onto it and trying this. I'm not sure if thats the reason, or if i need to put in some sort of password, or if i need to instal something entra with metamod to be able to use the commands. I know this really isn't the place to ask this sort of question due to it's not part of the monster mod but rather metamod and the server but if you could help me out i would apreciate it.

Thanks
