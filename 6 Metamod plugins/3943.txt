This is not directly related to Stripper2, but I figured someone here would know since they are dealing with stripper2.cfg's all the time. Its pretty simple. I had just learned that you could open an .sma file with notepad and edit it. So I tried to do the same thing with .bsp files and of course it didn't work. No problem. 

Problem is that in trying to open it with notepad, it now associates notepad with all my bsp files and thats a problem because as you know, stripper configs are notepads and it gets confusing. I know how to associate the bsp files with a program but I dont know which one to use. So the question is which?

.bsp files are compiled .sma file is not compiled. The compiled format for .sma is .amx, uncompiled .bsp is .map. :) ooooh dots.

To unassociate notepad with .bsp open up a folder and go to Tools > Folder Options (on XP/NT its udner a diffrent menu on 98 but still called Folder Options). Then click on the "File Types" tab. Find .bsp and hit Delete.

to fix it in WinXP it's MUCH simpler. right click the bsp file and go to open with, select the always open with box then select wordpad then open it. now, all bsp files are assosiated with wordpad and cfg files with notepad, great hehe :)
that's how i set my computer up.... i open a lot of BSP files to read the entities.

open a .bsp file and scroll to the button, there's a lot of entities there to read from :)

Uh, sean:

1) He want's to UNASSOCIATE files with Notepad.

2) You can't view BSP files without first decompiling them. Unless you can read this:
    TR  |   `{ lS øÛ
   ¤< ì  +à  ÄH  Ç  ä è…  Ì• èu „(       eø ´ èÇ  Ü{ D  œÓ Š/  Œj 8·  ( dg Ä!       À            €?  °Ã             €¿  °C     

That's the first few lines from 2bar2.bsp :)
