I'm trying to mod the turret guns in crossfire so that if anyone actually tries to use them (by pressing the use key) it will cause an explosion in the turret itself. I have this in my crossfire_str.cfg but it doesn't work:

{
   classname/env_explosion
   targetname/explode_1
   iMagnitude/80  // 1 - 250
   spawnflags/2   // SF_ENVEXPLOSION_REAPEATABLE
   origin/380 -1577 -1276
}

Can anyone help?

Also is there a strip command that will disable the nuke button on that map?

Thx

You have to have something trigger the env_explosion.  Since you want to explode when someone uses the sentry gun, just add a func_button that will get used and make the target be "explode_1".

I assume you already stripped out the "func_tankcontrols" that controls that sentry gun (otherwise they may still be able to use the gun).

Thanks Botman - works perfectly now :)

Any thoughts on the nuke button - if I strip all buttons out then the lifts don't work. Is there any way to target that one entity?

If you put the origin after the entity, it will strip out ONLY that one entity.  For example...
code:
[strip]
func_button (240 -900 1420)

...will only strip the func_button located at (240, -900, 1420)

i already worked on crossfire for several things...including the nuke i just made the button explode the user that pressed it. The problem is that it is hard to actually find that button because it is not an actual func_button. You have to strip the strike multi-manager to jusat remove the nuke period. Here we go:
[strip]
multi_manager (64 -2304 -1840)

that will get rid of the nuke in crossfire.

That was exactly the problem I was having - the nuke is triggered when someone approaches the button, so I was struggling to disable it. Thanks for the tip - worked first time :)
