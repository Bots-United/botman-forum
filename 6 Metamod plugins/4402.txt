I have a question about the code below.  Why is the specified team not the only one to use it?  I am running a TFC server (non-neotf) and anyone can use the item, it just scores for the other team if you get the wrong one.  Is there a way to make it so only the team specified can activate it?

Thank you,  I would like to use some of them.  And thanks for sharing your ideas and code.  I think the new things being done is what keeps the game going.  Always new things to look forward to.
