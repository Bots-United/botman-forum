There's no such entity as...

env_spritr 

...check your spelling and try again with 'env_sprite'.

thanks botman.that worked..now another problem. the sprite that im testing with is not tranparent like it is on the server that i got it from. in their server the sprite looks awesome. on mine i can see the black backgroud. why isnt it transparent ? im also using the sprite wizard and my own made sprites are not trans also. i thought the RGB color blue 255 was going to be trans..help

There is an option in SprWiz where it offers you 4 choices.  The default choice is 'Additive' which means make the sprite colors additive to the colors it's being rendered over.  This is not what you want.

The second choice is 'Alphatest' which uses index color 255 as the transparent color.  This is what you want as long as you are absolutely sure that the 255th color in the palette is the transparent color you will be using.

SprWiz also allows you to choose 'Indexalpha' (which is just monochrome like the old non-color spray logos) and 'Normal' which will have no transparency and will not blend in with the colors rendered behind it.
