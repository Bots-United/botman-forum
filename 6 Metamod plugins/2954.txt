i wanted to modify the map totalwar for tfc. i installed stripper2 and the message came up when i joined the game. i ran around as scout recording dimensions and locations and i finished with this:

[strip]
[add]
{
   classname/item_artifact_invincibility
   angles/0 270 0
   origin/-2 263 865
   respawn_delay/3
}
{
   classname/item_artifact_super_damage
   angles/0 270 0
   origin/-60 263 865
   respawn_delay/3
}
{
   classname/item_artifact_invisibility
   angles/0 270 0
   origin/53 263 865
   respawn_delay/3
}
{
   classname/detpack
   mdl/models/demopack.mdl
   origin/186 -78 165
   angle/180
}
{
   classname/detpack
   mdl/models/demopack.mdl
   origin/-186 78 165
   angle/180
}
{
   classname/trigger_teleport
   target/teleport_1
   origin/-15 -316 445
   bbox_min/-20 -20 -30
   bbox_max/20 20 30
}
{
   classname/info_teleport_destination
   targetname/teleport_1
   origin/-5 -10 -325
   angle/0
}
{
   classname/detpack
   mdl/models/demopack.mdl
   origin/-3514 -891 260
   angle/180
}
{
   classname/detpack
   mdl/models/demopack.mdl
   origin/3514 891 260
   angle/180
}
{
   classname/monstermaker
   origin/-7 -41 645
   angle/0
   monstercount/-1
   m_imaxlivechildren/-1
   monstertype/monster_snark
   delay/3
}

and then saved the file in my maps folder as totalwar_str.cfg and when i started the total war map it said "HostError: not a client" and then from the console i do changelevel totalwar and it says only the server can change map. this didn't happen when i didn't have that file there.

i also did a 2fort one that had a typo on one of the models and it couldn't load so i fixed it but from now on it doesn't load ever again. it has a snark maker, 4 teleports. 2 quad damge, 2 invincibility and a sniper pack on the battlements ;) oh yeh, my sig underwater, trap teleport that strips you clean so you are stuffed until you are dead and there is a button next to the cap point that sets of 3 env_explosions at a magnitude level of 120

www.geocities.com/dero887/2fort_str.txt - geocities easy upload doesnt wanna upload cfg files so i had to rename it to that

The "monstermaker" entity is not available in TFC.  You can only use "montermaker" with Half-Life deathmatch (or other MODs that have a montermaker entity).

Run the "entities.exe" application included with Stripper2 and browse to the tfc.dll file in the tfc\dlls folder and double click on it.  This will create a tfc.txt file in the tfc\dlls folder that contains all the entities available in TFC.

P.S. Also where you have "item_artifact_invincibility", I think you meant to use "item_artifact_invulnerability", since there is no "item_artifact_invincibility" entity in TFC either.

Put a sprite there.  See the example crossfire_str.cfg file included with Stripper2.
