liblist.gam has nothing to do with your router settings.  You need to check the FAQ's to see what ports you need to forward to your machine.

The liblist.gam line has been posted a few times, that and its in the faq if you'd ever bother reading it.

And we can't help you with your router since we don't know your model numbder nor are we tech support for it.

This is from the metmod README file in the 'doc' directory...

QUOTE:
If you want to install metamod by hand, here's what you have to do:


  - Install the metamod file (.dll for win32, or .so for linux) to the
    "dlls" directory under your game directory. For instance, if you were
    running Counter-Strike, under win32 you would have:

        half-life/cstrike/dlls/metamod.dll

  - Edit the "liblist.gam" file in your game directory, replacing the game
    dll filename with the metamod dll filename. For instance with
    Counter-Strike, you would change:

        gamedll "dlls\mp.dll"
        gamedll_linux "dlls/cs_i386.so"

    to:

        gamedll "dlls\metamod.dll"
        gamedll_linux "dlls/metamod_i386.so"

    Note that it's only really necessary to change the line corresponding
    to your OS (win32 or linux); you can leave the other line unchanged,
    or you can change it - it doesn't matter.


Setting up metamod won't allow people to join your server if your router is configured to block the IP ports needed by a Half-Life server.

See the Counter-Server link posted by cheesemonster to get the list of IP ports that must be opened in your router to allow other people to join.  Nobody can tell you how to do this since nobody knows what type of router you have (configuring them is all different, no two routers are configured using the same methods).
