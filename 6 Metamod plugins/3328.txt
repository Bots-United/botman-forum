Is there a way, using stripper2 or monster, to put some of the non-standard monsters into the game? I'm speaking of the monsters that were designed for HL but never made it into the finished product. Kingpin, chumtoad, etc. I have seen single player maps with these critters in them. Interaction with them would be limited of course, but it would be cool to put them behind a glass where they can be seen by players.

Secondly, has anyone figured out how to add BigMomma into the game? :)

Yes, you can add other monsters like chumtoad, flocking flyer, or others.  The problem is that there isn't any AI code for any of these, so if you add them they won't attack the players unless you also add code to them to make them attack.  You might be able to copy some of the code from other monsters, for example use the headcrab code to make chumtoads attack the same way.  The problem with that is the animations will be different and some of the ones from headcrab might not exist in chumtoad.

Bigmomma will be available in the next release of the Monster plugin.

I found a map w/ left-out monsters. I dumped the entities with bsp_tool and copied and pasted the following from it, with different origins of course: 

} 
classname/monster_generic 
angle/271 
model/models/stukabat.mdl 
origin/-64 779 -255 
} 

Does that look right? 
Nothing was spawned.

Did you have "mp_allowmonsters" set to 1?

Also the first brace is backwards '}' instead of '{' (like it should be).

Yes, allow monsters is on "1". I have hordes of critters running around in other maps.

My problem always comes when I try to create monsters without a monstermaker. Using the following example from the frenzy cfg given in this forum, nothing was spawned. I have c+p' ed it below:
[add]
PRECACHE_MODEL(models/hassassin.mdl) 
 
// Add a Human Assassin in light fixture 
{ 
classname/monster_human_assassin // add an assassin 
angle/90 
delay/0 
// trigger/0 
origin/-862 -374 584 
} 

Nothing spawned from this. However, when I made it a monstermaker using the same origin, the human assassin spawned correctly. I almost always have to use a monstermaker to spawn creatures. One notable exception is nihilanth. In that case I can use the syntax above.

But with monster_generic ( which is evidently how one spawns "left-out" monsters) the classname must be monster_generic rather than monstermaker.

I have noticed that if I am running a ListenServer or restarting my dedicated server I need to restart the map as some monsters do not appear...could very well be monster that are not created using monstermaker. Try doing a changelevel to the same map and see if they appear.

Well Ive been testing on a LAN. How would I change the map from within the game on a LAN or listenserver? Im using AdminMod.


Hey desnotes, do you have an idea of when your server will be open to the public? Im interested in seeing what you've cooked up. :)

To manually change a map, just type "map mapname" in the console, where "mapname" is the name of the map you want to switch to.  You can reload the same map you are currently running by just entering it's name.

to change a map using AdminMod, do Admin_map crossfire   but you have to have your password in first.


I am running two servers...the public one is:

desTubes (Dementia)  24.129.145.115

and is open all the time and running 24/7 (unless it crashes and I can't get to it). In the public one I am running 5-6 maps with a couple maps running 2-3 different stripper2 config files. I wrote an AdminMod plugin which will change the stripper2 config file during map change.

On my dev server, I set up a map and try out new stuff so there are usually monsters and grunts running around. If you are interested in seeing the dev part email me at mfisher@esnet.com and I will send you the password...I am usually there in the evenings and weekends trying stuff out.

Ok, restarting the server did the trick.
Thanks, guys.
