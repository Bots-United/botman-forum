You can't add rain unless you made thousands of sprites which is extremly laggy and unplayable across a network. You will need a mod (perhaps a hook like admin mod) and make some sort of plugin to make sprites near each player so it looks as though they see rain :D

It rains in one of the DoD maps... and it snows in one of the Deathmatch maps... but I can't remember the name of either.  It is possible, though.

It's very bad to do if you don't do it right. People with high frame rates (like me 99.9fps pretty much constantly) will render the rain/snow going backwards. If I remember right, its done by using lots of sprites and func_... damn it, can't remember what that entity is called.
