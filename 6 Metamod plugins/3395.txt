Everyone has probably came accross this problem once or twice

logaddress.
and the fact there is only one of them :(

we all have used serverspy, hlstats, csserverstat, jarcon, and many other countless applications that want to grab the logaddress out put, and generally dont' want to play nice with eachother.

people use psychostreamer (I, myself, use a modified megalog that will use a specified port to send from) 

why not make a metamod plugin that will do this, if not from port 27015, but another port that the user can specify, send logaddress lines out.
have a simple mm_logaddress add ip port
that you put in autoexec.cfg
and that leaves the actual logaddress free for testing new programs :D

I had a similar idea, but I cant code for...

My idea was a logaddress server that worked sort of like HLTV. Sits as a proxy and allows things to connect to it using the logaddress command...

Or rather, a program like HLSW that would use the logaddress command, then allow others to connect to it :).

But like I said, I can't code so I'll just dream.

well see the problem with using a proxy is
1.) setting up the server to send data to the proxy
2.) setting up the proxy to recieve data
3.) setting up the proxy to rebroad cast data
a.) many stats program require a SOURCE IP:PORT
b.) many proxy programs don't let you specify an output port they pic it randomly.
4.) setting the final stats collector to recognize the ip:port of the proxy

in addition
programs like hlstats and serverspy like to send data back to the server
and using a proxy it just got 20x harder.

if i open a udp socket for read/write (since i doubt hl will allow me to directly access 27015 for sending multiples) i could still accept incoming rcon and query information without having to totally remodify the other side of the connection.

Couldn't you use botman's packet collecter as a template to jump from? Or is that not open source, I can't remember.
