Is there a command to disable or turn off stripper2? I need to give this option to admins that use the server for practice and such. COuld not find this in the ReadMe.txt and I'd rather not have to modify metamod.ini and restart the server evertime they need to use the server.

No, there is no command to disable it.

If you don't want changes to run when the next map is loaded, you will have to delete (or rename) the map specific Stripper2 .cfg file.
