I've been having a hard time finding information on how to create some entities and functions. What I've gotten so far is bits and pieces with no info on how to put it all together. 

I found a site that tells -some- of the components of entities, but no rules on how to put them together. There are some zip files with examples in rmf format. What would I need to run/view these? Can I see a working example or at least some text?

Also, where can I find an exhaustive list of things like spawnflags for instance? If someone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it.

The only .rmf extension that I'm aware of is the Real Media Format (www.real.com), but that's usually audio or video data.  I don't know why there be any tutorial or entity information stored in a Real Media file.

Look at the .h files in the "engine" and "common" folders.  They contain all of the various types for the entity edict_t variables.  Search the SDK source code for the entity variable that you want to know about and find examples of Value setting it to various values (that's how everybody else does it, by searching).

RMF Files - Worldcraft Map Format.  RMF stands for Rich Map Format. It is Worldcraft's proprietary map format. 

The .RMF file contains information needed for map compilation: vertices of all brushes, and brush faces textures, and all info for both point-type and brush-type entities.  Before a map can be compiled it must be converted from an RMF file to a .MAP file.

So what program do I need to have to convert the rmf file into something I can view? Or at the very least view how the entities are set up?

Worldcraft will load the .rmf file.  You'll need to set up Worldcraft to compile the map and produce a .bsp file which can then be loaded by the Half-Life engine so you can play that level.

Make sure you compile the maps right... choose the option to not compile the bsp... if you compile the BSP over your clients will get an error that says "BSP DIffers from server" or whatever.
