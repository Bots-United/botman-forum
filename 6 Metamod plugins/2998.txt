Strip the the worldspawn and add it again.

1) Add the under the skyname/<name> in the worldspawn.

2) Adminmod :D admin_fun 1 say glow blue, or admin_glow <target> <color>

I don't think stipping "worldspawn" will work (I've never actually tried it though).

You can change the sky using client CVAR "cl_skyname"...

cl_skyname desert

...for example.  If you want to permanently change the sky you can use "ripent" from Zoner's Half-Life tools to extract the worldspawn entity, modify it then rebuild the map .bsp file with the modified skyname.

Getting models to glow requires MOD code changes and can't be done with Stripper2.

Stripping the worldspawn works fine, I used to do it all the time on crap maps like vs_quaint, remove the skybox and add a decent one, fixing max_vis issues etc.

Worldspawn, the only worldspawn value that doesn't seem to change is the default light value.

PS, you can make players glow in TFC (see rock2), not sure how it is done. But most players will agree that glowing is only fun for a few minutes as it makes everyone too easy to kill.

The reason players glow in rock2 is because of

item_artifact_envirosuit

Or another one like that, every one who got the suit is protected against the gas. They glows goldish I think...

Like I said above, I don't think stripping "worldspawn" when using Stripper2 will work, because entities added with Stripper2 aren't created until the ServerActivate() function is called by the engine.  This should be after ALL the other entities in the .bsp file have been spawned by the engine.  Waiting until after all the items are spawned to spawn "worldspawn" doesn't seem like it would work properly to me.

Try using "ripent" in Zoner's Half-Life tools to modify the "worldspawn" entity.

With Zoner Tools changing the sky box is very easy.  After you export bsp with Zoner Tools find the worldspawn entity at the top of the ent file.  There you will see a "skyname".  Simply add the new "skyname" and import the additions into the bsp. If you have probs email me.

Stripping the worldspawn does work, I've done it. YOu can modify everything but the default light level.

As in changing max_vissible, skyname, the only things that really ever should be changed. I've managed to do all that

You think that changing max_vis to something like 128 would screw with OGC? :). I should try that, although it would also screw with everyone else :(.

I think this should work......

you can get models to glow by using

renderfx/13
rendercolor/(red) (green) (blue)

into a spawning model..
replace (red) with the amount of red colour you want to give the model
replace (green) with the amount of red colour you want to give the model
replace (blue) with the amount of red colour you want to give the model

all colours must be from 0 to 255

e.g.

renderfx/13
rendercolor/255 255 255

will make something glow white

hmm...k...

[strip]
mapversion
mapversion
sounds
message
skyname
Maxrange
worldspawn
worldspawn
[add]
{
mapversion/340
mapversion/220
sounds/1
message/2fort
skyname/night
MaxRange/4096
classname/worldspawn
classname/worldspawn
}

That works when i start map from the console, but not when i try that in LAN. I guess doesnt work in a server...

... When adding a worldspawn...

[add]
 {
 classname/worldspawn
 max_range/9999 //Use 9999 not 4096
 skyname/night
 sounds/1 //Not needed
 }

The diffrence between 4096 and 9999 wont be noticable on 2fort, but will be on well and other maps with large open areas. The rest of teh worldspawn info isn't needed as all that is built into the map on compile.

The sounds variable is left over from half-life, it tells the map what CD track to play from whatever CD is in your CD drive.

Message I believe is also left over from HL, and as far as I've seen does nothing on TFC maps.

I usualy add startdark/1 because I think it looks cooler when the levels fade in :).

You only need to strip the worldspawn, for all of that info is in the worldspawn :).

I know this works on lan, because I lan to my net server. And players who play on the server notice it too (only when pointed out though :).

Hey cheese, you sure that will work? I don't see anything like rendercolor or renderfx for info_player_teamspawn. You would need to make the player use the model inorder to glow, so it would need to be a player model, like the env_suit.

That's too much work just to get players to glow, especialy when you could just use adminmod :).

oh...

Yeah I think I know what you mean.

If you decompile rock2 map then you can see what they do to make a player glow when they pick up a suit. :)
