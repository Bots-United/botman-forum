I had stripper2 working perfectly on my server a couple of months ago, and when I went to re-enable it, it doesn't seem to load and I get the following error in the logs (yes, I have downloaded the most current version):

[META] dll: Note: Plugin '<stripper2_mm.dll>' interface version didn't match; expected 5:8, found 5:7

[META] dll: Note: plugin '<stripper2_mm.dll>' is not using the latest interface version; there may be an updated version of the plugin

nm... read the thread below this one.
Didn't read it first because it said "Crash" and it doesn't "crash", it just fails to load :)

Actually, it should still load.  Those are just warnings, they won't cause the Stripper2 or the Monster plugin to not load.
