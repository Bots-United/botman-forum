well, i did a quick search and found no posts about this prob so here it is

if i spawn an alien slave using the monster plugin, then kill it with something heavy, like a shotgun up close, while the slave is charging the attack, the electricity stays, it even laches on to stuff like other monsters, i havent tried this on other mods than the specialists...
the same thing happens when i spawn them before the map loads... this isnt an emergency, but its so annoying... i also got a sound problem but i think i solved it, precaching less monsters...
this happens to both hullus and botmans plugin...

edit: damn it took my real name, well sts...

also why is the monsters having a tendency to ploff(hehe) away when heavily damgage inflicted
i dont like that, and have bizzare blood, iamf you can remove both that monsters ploff away (even on grenades :P) and the blood, neither do i like that they are pushed backwards...
