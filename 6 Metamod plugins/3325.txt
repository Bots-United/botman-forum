I've been trying to change the skymap texture on a couple of maps with Darkulator 2.0, but so far it just doesn't work. There is no reaction except for the skymap's new name. It doesn't look different at all. I assume I can rename the skybox from "dark" to something like "city" as long as the latter is in the mod's gfx/env/ folder OR in the .pak-file...?
What am I doing wrong, overlooking, or not doing at all ?

PS! I have also changed the light levels of these maps, and that feature of Darkulator works excellent.

You should be able to use any of the skymap textures found in the MODs gfx\env directory.  You didn't state which MOD you were trying to change maps for.  If you are running Counter-Strike, you can use the skymap names in cstrike\gfx\env or valve\gfx\env (or from the valve\pak0.pak file).  If you are running TFC, you can use the skymap names in tfc\gfx\env or valve\gfx\env (or from the valve\pak0.pak file).

You can't use skymap names in the tfc directory for Counter-Strike or use the skymap names in the cstrike directory for TFC.

If you change the skymap texture name, save the file, rename the old .bsp to something else, and rename the new .bsp file to whatever the old one was, you should see that new skymap when you load up that map.

I am referring to regular HLDM (=Valve). I've read the readme and had a look at previous posts on this forum (searched for and read through posts on skymap, skybox and skyname), but can't seem to find the solution at this time.
I did the renaming of the file, but with no result. The skymap is still the old one ("dark") :(
Any ideas as to what I'm overlooking ? I am running the latest versions of HL, Darkulator etc.

Kind regards,

Which map are you trying to change?  Perhaps there's a bug that I haven't encountered before.

I've been trying the exact same thing on two different HLDM maps; Gotham.bsp and KingPin.bsp. Both can be obtained at Global Assault.

Kind regards,

I decided not to make a new post.

I also have a problem with darkulator.
My problem is that i dont understand how i would change the sky and light levels of a map like 2fort. In the darkulator readme is sias You SHOULD NOT use the same filename as the original BSP map filename when saving the BSP file. If i saved it as something besided the origional map name, wouldnt i be making a new map that people would have to download?

The Darkulator utility was meant to be a tool for you to use to generate NEW maps based on existing maps.  In the new map, you can change the light levels and change the sky texture.  If you save the modified map back to original filename, clients will not be able to connect to your server because the map on your server (2fort.bsp) and the map on the client (2fort.bsp) do not have the same CRC.  This is a cheat protection designed to keep a client from making a map full bright on the client and connecting to a server where the map is dark for everyone else (because they haven't modified the map on their clients).

If you modify a map with the Darkulator utility, you will need to save it under a new name (2fort_dark.bsp or something similar) so that clients can download it and then connect to your server.

is there a command that will change the sky texture in game?

There is a server cvar ("sv_skyname" I think) that will allow the server operator to change the sky texture, but you would have to enter this manually each time the map was loaded (or put it in the server.cfg file).
