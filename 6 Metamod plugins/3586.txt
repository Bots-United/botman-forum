Ok. The mod in question is S&I. They changed the format of some entites making old maps incompatible. I figure that I can strip out the broken entites and replace them with updated ones. All went well... up to a point.

I need to replace some func_doors. Unfortunatly when I export the entites with ripent I get this for the doors..

{
"model" "*25"
"renderamt" "100"
"rendermode" "2"
"classname" "func_door"
}

So um.. wheres the origin, and whats going on with that model name? Anyway.. I can't find the doors I need to replace, and it appears theres something going on that I don't understand. Any suggestions?

The "*" model name indicates a brush model (see some Worldcraft tutorial websites for an explanation of what brush models are).

"*25" would be brush model index #25.  If you use my planethalflife.com/botman/bsp_tool.shtmlBSP tools, you can dump the model information contained in the BSP file.  This will give you information about brush model #25.  Just use "bsp_tool -m mapname.bsp >mapname.txt" to redirect the output to a text file, then browse the text file with Notepad.  Scroll down to Model Index 25 and you'll see the min and max 3D coordinates (X, Y, and Z values).  This will give you the bounds of the brush model.  All brush models have an origin of (0,0,0) so you have to do some math from the min and max values to calculate the origin.  If you add min.x and max.x together and divide by 2 you will get the X origin.  Do the same for Y and Z and you get the X,Y,Z origin of the brush model.

You can't use Stripper2 to create brush models on the fly.  They have to be created in Worldcraft and compiled into the .bsp file.  You can create entities that use existing brush models and reposition them at other locations.  See the example Stripper2 .cfg file for the map crossfire where I copy one of the func_button entities (which is a brush model) and place it in the wall next to the secret blue room door.  You can do something similar to func_doors.  You can move them from one place to another, but you can't create them from nothing.

thanks botman, I don't have to do anything too messy, just add some 'team' keys to some doors (2 for each team) and the health/HEV chargers (2 of these for each team aswell). So 12 entites in total.

I know vaguely where the doors are, because I've used bspview to get the co-ords. So hopefully with the maths you've outlined I can figure it out which door is which :)

One other thing, As I only need to strip out 4 func_doors not all of them in the map. Is there a way to do this, seeing as the origin all evaluate to 0 0 0 I cant use that method to individually strip then. Any suggestions?

Nope.  Stripper2 only allows you to strip entities out by origin.  Since ALL func_doors have the same origin you would have to strip out all doors (you can't select just one).

The good thing is that you can strip out all doors and then ADD some doors back in using the Stripper2 [add] section.  Just use the bsp_tool to dump the entities to a file, then cut and paste the func_doors you want to keep into the Stripper2 .cfg in the [add] section.

Need coordinates?

Decompile the map, look at the map format, use the Find option and look for func_door. You'll get teh coordinates for every door.

If you need a specific door, open the .map file in Worldcraft rather then notepad. Give the fun_door a name "Name (Target Name) | Yay!".

Save the map and look for the word Yay using serach.
