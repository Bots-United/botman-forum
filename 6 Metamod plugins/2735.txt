I'm a complete newbie to adminmod, metamod and all serversidestuff what so ever.

However, I have read the ReadMe that came with the Stripper2, but I still don't understand where the naked ladies are.... :P

Seriously, in the ReadMe and elsewhere you constantly use the term "when the map loads...". Does this mean that you CAN'T change the way the map starts each round. I'm plying CS and is interested in knowing how it works for this MOD only. 

If you have set up the .cfg to spawn a shottygun somewhere in a map with a 60% chance of it actually happening... You load the map and enter into the game. If the shottygun does "get lucky" and spawn, will it spawn every consecutive round as well? Or is there a 60% chance each round? I assume you mean that the gun will appear every consecutive round, but I just wanna make sure.

Is there a way to make it random between each round?

Is it possible to Strip an entity from a map after a map is loaded without having to reload the entire map first, i.e. in between rounds? Guess not, but as mentioned earlier "just wanna...." well you know...

If I had my own server or even the slightest bit of knowledge of adminmod etc I wouldn't have bothered you, but here I am.

It will either spawn every single round, or will never spawn... it is decided when the map is loaded, not after each round... hope this answers your question :)

as for striping stuff between rounds... also not possible... everything is done when the map is loaded...

Correct, once an entity spawns, it will continue to respawn as long as that map is loaded (regardless of rounds).
