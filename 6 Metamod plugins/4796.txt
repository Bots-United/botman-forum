Subject: Question Monster or Stripper

I've seen people talking and providing config examples that put entities into a mod (ie tfc) and assign them such that they are a part of a team (assuming they attack only the enemy). Is this done with monster or are they talking about stripper? Because I also read that Stripper can't add monsters to tfc, only to deathmatch. if monster supports this why is it not in the Readme or examples in the sample configs?

Stripper2 by itself can't be used to add monsters to any MOD.

Of course, Stripper2 and Monster can be used together, but you can't place something in the Stripper2 .cfg file that would effect the Monster plugin (i.e. you can't have Stripper2 spawn Monster spawn points, this can only be done using the Monster .cfg file).

I think all of the team specific TFC entities are created using Stripper2, but these are entities that are inherently supported by TFC.

For TFC entities, see the "Quick Reference" at the VERC TFMapped website...

ok so say I wanted to spawn a barney near each of the flags on 2fort and have them only shoot the enemy team, that would be done with stripper2? If I do this will they respawn when they die or no? 

I've also seen people referring to monster_grunt_repel in conjunction with ospreys or apache's, this is done with Stripper2 or is that a combo of monster and stripper, ie spawn apache via monster and add grunt repellers via stripper? Since hgrunt is already available from monster can monster spawn the grunt repelling from the apache?

Nope.  Can't be done.  Monsters (using the Monster plugin) don't know ANYTHING about teams.  Stripper2 can't spawn single player monsters in TFC because TFC doesn't already support monsters from single player (i.e. the entities don't exist in TFC).

"Since hgrunt is already available from monster can monster spawn the grunt repelling from the apache?"

Grunts repelling from the apache is done using the "monster_grunt_repel" entity.  This entity also does not exist natively in TFC and therefore can't be spawned using Stripper2.  This monster does not exist in the Monster plugin and therefore can't be spawned using Monster either.

You CAN spawn a generic monster entity (such as "monster_furniture" and use the repelling hgrunt model as the model for it to display (in the "mdl" key for TFC) by creating "monster_furniture" using Stripper2, but the entity won't be animated (it won't move, shoot, play sounds, etc.).

So then what your saying is I should hack monster to add team support. Any tips on how to accomplish this?

Say I wanted to add repelling grunts to monster, I imagine I would want to borrow from the single player source such as from hgrunt.cpp SDK Version:
LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS( monster_grunt_repel, CHGruntRepel );

Would it be best to keep this seperate or why was it removed from your hgrunt.cpp monster version?

This has all been talked about already, examples of adding new monsters are already placed on the forum. I suggest clicking search rather then starting a new topic thats been discussed in depth atleast 4 times.

Thank you for the suggestion but I've spent the last three days searching and reading. The question was about a monster that was already added but had the repel code eliminated during its port over. Botman was the one that ported over the hgrunt so I'm curious why he decided to cut out that portion of the code or what I'm missing. It wasn't a general question about adding additional monsters.

There's no real reason monster_grunt_repel was removed from hgrunt.cpp other than to make it easier to convert to the Monster plugin format.

Repeling grunts need something to repel from and I wasn't sure how much this would really be used.  Standing grunts can be placed anywhere (even underwater), so they don't require any special places to be used.

To get the Monster entities to only target one team, you would need to add an new key/value pair to the monsters to indicate which team they are "on" and then use similar code that the HPB bot does to determine which teams TFC players are on (don't forget about allies like in Hunted maps).  Alternately, instead of making the key/value pair indicate which team they are on (and attacking everyone else except allies), you could make the key/value pair indicate which team you want them to attack (only attack blue, or only attack red, or only attack green, etc.).

All of the Monsters determine their enemies based on the IRelationship function that's in the monsters.cpp file.  You would need to change how this table works or, probably easier, just replace it with custom code that only targets TFC players of one team or another, and when you do this, monsters will not attack each other (i.e. bullsquids won't attack scientist and hgrunts won't attack zombies, etc.).
