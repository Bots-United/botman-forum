To Botman,

Stripper2 is a great tool, but it is rather hard to use, since it requires getting coordinates from maps and then manually typing them into a .cfg file. For example, to simply create a new spawn point you have to go to the extent of finding the coordinates in the game and the angle you want to position them at. This task is greatly facilitated by your BSP_view.exe program. But i was wondering if it wouldn't be possible to make it even easier by combining BSP_view with stripper2.

What would be great is that if you could just run BSP_view, fly to the position you want to place your spawn point then simply click on the left mouse button and it would add the appropriate code to .cfg file. This would be a great time saver and make it more accessible to the public.

Someone else had mentioned this to me in an e-mail.  He also suggested reading the stripper2 config file and loading and displaying those entities as well as the ones from the BSP file.

I might wind up adding these as features to the BSP viewer at some point in the future, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it!  ;)
