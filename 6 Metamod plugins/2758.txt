"func_tank" is the entity used for player operated turret guns.

You will have a hard time adding a func_tank unless there is already a func_tank in the map since you will have to clone one of the existing BSP brush models for the turrent gun.  An alternate way to do this would be to create a new model (turret.mdl?) and use that as the "model" key/value for your func_tank.

Here's an example func_tank from the stalkyard.bsp deathmatch map...
code:
Key/Value         : classname/func_tank
Key/Value         : spawnflags/32
Key/Value         : renderamt/0
Key/Value         : target/siloguardgunwav
Key/Value         : yawrate/600
Key/Value         : yawrange/60
Key/Value         : yawtolerance/15
Key/Value         : pitchrate/600
Key/Value         : pitchrange/35
Key/Value         : pitchtolerance/5
Key/Value         : barrel/70
Key/Value         : spritescale/.50
Key/Value         : firerate/10
Key/Value         : persistence/3
Key/Value         : firespread/2
Key/Value         : spriteflash/sprites/muzzleflash2.spr
Key/Value         : renderfx/0
Key/Value         : rendermode/0
Key/Value         : rendercolor/0 0 0
Key/Value         : bullet/3
Key/Value         : barrely/0
Key/Value         : barrelz/0
Key/Value         : minRange/0
Key/Value         : maxRange/0
Key/Value         : targetname/biggun
Key/Value         : bullet_damage/50
Key/Value         : origin/457 0 241
Key/Value         : model/*16

P.S. Don't forget to add a "func_tankcontrols"...
code:
Key/Value         : classname/func_tankcontrols
Key/Value         : target/biggun
Key/Value         : model/*17

You need to have "PRECACHE_MODEL(models/sentry1.mdl)" in the 2fort_str.cfg file (placed somewhere before the entity you are trying to create).

heres what i did, i used hl model viewer to extract the sentry.mdl from hl, i stuck it in tfc\models directory, i tried precaching it, and also the sentry1.mdl for that matter, but neither is saying that it is precaching on the map load, and the server crashes, why am i not allowed to get this model precached as u stated that we could? if u could, would u actually show that its possible with example orgins and such and also the proper way to precache the models if there is a way, im completely lost but your program is still fun to use nevertheless, thx for the troubleshooting botman

Here's a 2fort_str.cfg file that will create a func_tank just below the sniper tower at the Blue team's side of the bridge...
code:
[add]

PRECAHCE_SOUND(ambience/biggun1.wav)
PRECACHE_MODEL(models/sentry1.mdl)
PRECACHE_SPRITE(sprites/muzzleflash2.spr)

{
   classname/ambient_generic
   angle/88
   spawnflags/56
   message/ambience/biggun1.wav
   health/10
   preset/0
   volstart/0
   fadein/0
   fadeout/0
   pitch/120
   pitchstart/100
   spinup/0
   spindown/0
   lfotype/0
   lforate/0
   lfomodpitch/0
   lfomodvol/0
   cspinup/0
   targetname/tankwav
   origin/0 -740 -460
}

{
   classname/func_tank
   spawnflags/32
   renderamt/0
   target/tankwav
   yawrate/600
   yawrange/60
   yawtolerance/15
   pitchrate/600
   pitchrange/35
   pitchtolerance/5
   barrel/70
   spritescale/.50
   firerate/10
   persistence/3
   firespread/2
   spriteflash/sprites/muzzleflash2.spr
   renderfx/0
   rendermode/0
   rendercolor/0 0 0
   bullet/3
   barrely/0
   barrelz/0
   minRange/0
   maxRange/0
   targetname/biggun
   bullet_damage/50
   origin/0 -740 -460
   model/models/sentry1.mdl
}

{
   classname/func_tankcontrols
   target/biggun
   origin/0 -740 -450
}

...the pitch and yaw limits aren't correct (since I grabbed this from stalkyard.bsp), you'll have to fix that.  The gun floats off the ground, you'll need to fix that too.  I don't know if this actually does any damage or not, but you can use it and fire it.

If i want the user to be forced to download a custom model, (ie) "custom.mdl", what directory does the model have to be in on my server computer and what do i add to the 2fort_str.cfg to make users have to download custom.mdl?

All of your custom files need to be within the MOD directory (tfc in this case).  Custom models will go in Half-Life\tfc\models.  Custom sounds will go in Half-Life\tfc\sound (notice there is no 's' at the end).  Custom sprites will go in Half-Life\tfc\sprites.

If your servers precaches a model, sound or sprite, and it does not exist on the client, the server will download that custom model, sound or sprite to the client and put it in the proper directory.

If you want clients to be forced to download the model (otherwise they will be disconnected... ERROR: Can not continue without model sentry.mdl). You need a res file...

//2fort.res
models/sentry.mdl
//End 2fort.res

That will force connecting clients to DL the model on connect to server. The res file should be in your tfc/ dir.

TFC will not download anything but maps/txt your your hard drive, without a res file. As far as I know... res files were created to help out the custom map community, made it possible to download custom models/sounds/sprites from server.

Could someone please then post the files then needed to go where....

If you could help in that endevor I would appreciate it...

Once again this is to add files to the de_dust map, I am also trying to add this feature in the map.

But I would also like to add half life weapons to CS, like the tripmine and the RPG.

If any of you could help.. I would appreciate it.
