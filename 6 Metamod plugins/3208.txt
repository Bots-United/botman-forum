Does the montser metamod plugin preload the model?  If I remember correctly, and I may be totaly off here, admin_spawn could only spawn things that are preload/precached.  And since admin_spawn is setup for x,y,z points.  It would be easy to make an adminmod plugin to drop a monster on a poor camper.  Thanks all.  And great metamod plugin.

But it wouldn't work, or I don't think it would.

admin_spawn works fine on healthkit armor etc...

But all thoses are already coded into the MOD dll.

And the monster code is in the plugin dll, I don't think it'll work but you should always try it.

admin_spawn is an AdminMOD command (I assume).  The Monster plugin has nothing to do with AdminMOD and no AdminMOD commands will effect anything in any other metamod plugin (like Monster).

It might do what he's asking...

admin_spawn wont spawn anything unless it is loaded with the map (otherwise it would crash server like when using sv_cheats 1 "give something"). I don't see why something another plugin loaded into memory would not be available for another plugin?
