nice! I tak it you need to have admin mod installed ... Cos the MOD I'd like to try it for isn't supported by admin mod I think (Well at least hardly anyone seems to be able to get it to work with it) The MOD is rocket crowbar 1.9 Btw!

Nah Cheesy, you don't need Admin Mod at all botman say's.. Just need the ( metamod.dll ) .. Just go to botman's front page or the link he has here & you'll see the link to metamod.. Metamod has a version for windows & linux. Just scroll down the metamod page till you see "Downloads" & there's the non-zipped or zipped downloads avaliable.

Wish fileplanet wasn't all bogged down! Must be something good that was released, sez i have to wait 44 mins. till i get to dl .. :(

Btw.
Isn't it possible to cheat with the stripper?
Because you can adjust a map and the client doesn't even know it..

Well because it is a server side plugin, it isn't exactly a cheat.

All clients that connect to that server will see the same things (as long as you are using models, sounds and sprites that are already included with Half-Life, or, if they are custom, as long as the client hasn't turned off downloads from the server, which are enabled by default).

As long as everybody sees the same thing, I wouldn't really consider it cheating.  You could create some advantages for one team and not another.  For example, create a teleporter just outside one team's spawn area that teleports them to a goal (like a flag in TFC), then create another teleporter that takes them right next to the capture point for the flag.  Ta-Da!  Your team will be capping the flag in under 10 seconds everytime!  :D

Well i call that cheating..
I mean when i play a war with tfc i don't think i will notice if someone has created an secret teleporter.
Then the opponent has a advantage and they will win....
So I do call it cheating..and maybe some clans will use this "cheat"

well its the server's disgression, not that every server will make teleports for every map! :p

yeah but if you have your own clan server and you want to play a war on it....you can easily take advantage by using this "cheat"

But it's not something that someone can't already do using www.valve-erc.com/resources/?page=zhltripent.  For example see this...

Hmm I didn't there was already such a program...
But i looked it all over again and when you play against a clan that has made a secret teleporter for them i guess you will notice it :)
I mean getting in and out the flagroom without being spotted by the defense..that is impos.

Of course this program as well as ripent can be used to create secret advantages to some teams. And of course it would be considered cheating if the server admin chose to "turn to the dark side".

If for example in a CS-clanwar the admin has prepared to spawn a bunch of AKs or Deagles or what have you in front of his team when they're playing Ts, the enemy would never learn of this. And when it's time to switch sides, the admin runs a different .cfg removing the guns from the Ts and placing guns in front of the CTs instead... Who would ever know? Maybe if one of the Enemies switched sides and saw this first hand...maybe. 

Same thing if a brush suddenly is used as trigger_hurt. What would you get if you had the brush trigger a negative damage? duh....
