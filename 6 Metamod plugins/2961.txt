Hey... all you want is you make the civilan run through a weapon strip... use "info_tfgoal" for this, you could also give him a little head start by making him invincible... then the other teams won't get caught up in it. BTW hunted on 2fort... sounds interesting.. you gotta show me the outcome

the question was, HOW do you do it :)
i was thinking, i'm gonna put the sniper-rifles in the respawn and thats the only weapon you can have (using botmans example in this forum) Then im gonna have an invisible teleportal on either end of the bridge and if you go in it you get teleported back to the respawn. The red and blue team become one together to shoot the civilian(s). the person with the highest score wins. the civilian can only move around the bridge invisibile walls s so he can't get off. :)

I doubt anyone would want to play the civilian since they don't seem to have any way to score points (unless they also get to have some guns, maybe the HWguy chaingun).

    mdl/models/homer.mdl  //what model to show (not sure if this works but it might)

I think player class should be 11 or 12 for civ.

This is from the TFC .fgd file for TFCriteria...
code:
   //#desc Set which class is allowed to activate goal. You can only select 1,
   // you can't add these bits up.
   playerclass(choices) : "Player class" : 0 =
   [
      0 : "Any"
      1 : "Scout"
      2 : "Sniper"
      3 : "Soldier"
      4 : "Demolitions man"
      5 : "Medic"
      6 : "Heavy Weapons Guy"
      7 : "Pyro"
      8 : "Spy"
      9 : "Engineer"
]

...I don't think you can have a goal that's only activated by civilians (you'd probably have to make it "Any" for team #3).  Create a new team for civilians.

Botman, isn't it 0 for civilian, 1 for scout, 2 for sniper, 4 for soldier, 8 for demoman, 16 for medic... etc? And it's only 0-9 when selecting classes and running admin commands like admin_execclient <target> "jointeam 1; class 1"?

If you look in worldcraft an info_tfdetect you can see how the players add up in the (what the hell are those numbers called? some kind of numeric system), the 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 512 etc. Most everything in HL revolves around those numbers in mapping.

BTW, I have a 2fort hunted config, its complete minus 2 things... 1) When the civilian is killed by assassins the assassins don't respawn (but bodyguards do). 2) When the civilian escapes the bodyguards don't respawn but the assassins do (with no ammo). :-/

The hunted starts in the Red Respawn (all doors are striped from all bases as are nobuilds). The hunted is a scout (makes it fair). The assassins can be engineers and snipers, who all spawn in the blue base. The hunted's goal is to make it to the blue flag point in the flag room.

If I were at home right now, I'd post it for someone to take a look at, I will post tonight (if I remember... 5 hours 'till I'm home, long time to remember q;-)

EDIT:
Oh yea, as far as I remember a goal can be used by more then one class by adding the class numbers... 512+256 = 768, which would allow both a Engineer or a Spy to use an item.

EDIT #2: I'm trying to give the hunted 5 points per escape but am failing... I was thinking that I'd re-add the nobuilds and convert those to give points to the civilian when crossed, but would deatcive after used.

EDIT #3: Fixed some errors...

Got sick of editing... if you really want to write a hunted config decompile hunted and look at the entities with notepad.

Here it is, its WAY too large to post here, so I zipped it and put it on my website... but since it's geocities it has to be an inderect link... sorry :-/.

http://www.geocities.com/rexaward/2fort_Hunted.htm

Can someone take a look at it and see if you can figure out what's wrong?

I'll change my mulch server so it only runs this map... you can see how it plays there.

mulch.kick-ass.net:27015 server should be called "2fort Hunted Test Server"...

Damn it, I just checked the config, I never fixed the hunted... at the moment the hunted can be a scout, hwguy, and a few other things. I'll fix that now.

EDIT: If you can't connect from the dns address, try 199.174.171.117:27015 - this IP may change.

I believe that the only way to get a civilian on a map is by adding "maxammo_shells" "-1" to the "classname" "info_tfdetect" entity (maxammo_shells would put the civilian on the blue team, and –1 is the civilian class).  The civilian can have allies but cannot be part of mixed team with other classes.  If you want only a civilian to pick up or use an item on the map you add "playerclass" "11" to the "classname" "info_tfgoal"  

In addition, there are programs out there like Rob Harwood’s Remote-x that allows a server to change players into civilians (and have them on a mixed team) via a server command or in response to a verbal cue.

On our server we use Remote-x where players are turned into civis at their request, and we have added umbrella models that the civis only can activate that give them 
invincibility and quad damage for a short burst of time.  Quite funny.
