Subject: Interesting config for de_dust!

--------------------------------------------------
I have spent considerable time making a configuration file for de_dust. So i thought i might share it with the rest of you. Here is a short description of the changes:

I have stripped all the standard player spawn points and replaced them by 10 random positions in the map (obviously not completely random, they do actually spawn you INSIDE the map ;)). Each respawn can be either CT or T selected at random each time the map is loaded, my idea was to add a little bit more action and turn it into more of a deathmatch.

On top of that i have effectively reduced the size of the map by adding teleporters preventing you from entering the T and CT bases. This was done with 4 fairly large teleporter bounding boxes at each entrance to the bases. I have decided to keep the bomb spot in there, just to make it a little more fun. If the terro's respawn by the bomb spot they will get an easy plant, and CTs will have to rush over there to defuse. But this will only happen occasionaly since the respawn points are random. If you want to take the bomb spot out just remove the comments from the first line in the [strip] section.

I was thinking of maybe adding some weapons, armor on the floor all around the map and removing the buy zones so that it would be a real deathmatch game, but haven't had time to do that yet. I know how to do it, just takes a while getting the coordinates and choosing what weapons to put where. If people like it then maybe i'll do that.

One last thing, this config was not designed for large numbers of players, There are only 10 respawns for CT and T together. So that would be a maximum of 10 players. And it would probably not be a good idea to play with that many players anyway because the respawns are chosen at random, sometimes you may get 6 CT respawns and only 4 Terro respawns. making the teams unfair.

Anyway, enough talk... here comes the code:

//func_bomb_target
info_player_start
info_player_deathmatch
func_buyzone

You might want to make some of the T's and CT's spawn points be static.  There's a very small chance that you could create a map with no spawn points for one team (I assume CS would either lock up or crash in this case).

If you had only 1 or 2 static spawn points for each team you could still run into problems with several players spawning at the same point (which I think would cause them to get stuck together like siamese twins).

CS doesn't crash if there are no spawn points for one team... it just gives you a "The team is full" message when you try to join it :)

And if there are only say 2 spawns for Terrorists and 3 people try to join that team, the third person would be told "The team is full"...

If this happens you can simply reload the map.

And there was something i wanted to ask you, is it possible to have for example 3 respawns grouped together... that would 50% of the time be CT spawns and 50% be Terro spawns... i would like to create little squads of CTs and Terrorists spawning together in the same area while keeping the placing random.

In your readme.txt you mentioned that you cannot make more than 2 levels of subgroups... here is what i would like to be able to do:

=============================================

{
  {
      // Place the following 3 CT spawn points 50% of the time
      {
           classname/info_player_start  // CT spawn point
           angle/270
           origin/-1190 1490 40
      }
      {
           classname/info_player_start  // CT spawn point
           angle/270
           origin/-1150 1490 40
      }
      {
           classname/info_player_start  // CT spawn point
           angle/270
           origin/-1110 1490 40
      }
  } 50%
  {
      // Place the following 3 Terro spawn points 50% of the time
      {
           classname/info_player_deathmatch  // T spawn point
           angle/270
           origin/-1190 1490 40
      }
      {
           classname/info_player_deathmatch  // T spawn point
           angle/270
           origin/-1150 1490 40
      }
      {
           classname/info_player_deathmatch  // T spawn point
           angle/270
           origin/-1110 1490 40
      }
  } 50%
}

=============================================

I haven't actually tried it since you said that it wouldn't work in the readme.txt, is there any other way of doing it so that it would work? or is it just impossible at the moment?

PS: (SpaceDude = Martin), i'm the same person, i just changed the name after posting my first message :)

There isn't any other way to do what you want.  Stripper2 will only support 2 levels of brackets '{' after the second nested brackets, it will ignore any new brackets and will get confused when it reaches the closing brackets '}'.

Something else you can't do is group multiple things together so that they all spawn or none of them spawn.  For example you can't have a config file that spawns a shotgun with 2 shotgun shell ammos beside it, OR spawns a crossbow with 2 crossbow bolt ammos beside it.

The reason that I don't allow the nesting to go this deep is because the parser that I wrote for the configuration file is VERY simple.  Someone might be able to modify the config file parsing code to handle ANY level of nesting, but I didn't expect many people to want/need this type of thing.  Most people simply want to add a few spawn points, add some weapons, or strip out a weapon or two from the game and that's all.
