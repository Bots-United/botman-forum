can you spawn engy sentry guns that actually work? (not the monster sentry guns, the ones that the engys build), and make them team specific?

and if they get destroyed, have them reappear in 30 seconds?

could it be possible to make a monster turret using a sentrygun model, and give it x amount of hp, so it can be destroyed?

I think it would be possible to reset the ammount of Sentry-Guns you have... Though I don't know...

I know that RobGP, and Drunken-F00l have all created a way to "Reset" the ammount of Sentry-Gun's you have

It would be done with a server side mod.

it is possible to spawn sentry guns and set the owner manually (which TFC needs as to not crash as soon as its spawned) but it is quite involved, you are better off creating a monster type entity that acts as a gun.
