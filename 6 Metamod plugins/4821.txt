HI folks, not sure if this is the right place to be asking this question but here goes anyway.
I've done a search thru this site but can't seem to find anything, hence the above comment.
Is there an easy way to add player spawnpoints to a map? Could you add a spawn points in the same way you add weapons using the Stripper2 plugin? Or am I just being dim?

Thanks.

Ps If this isn't the place to be asking this question just tell me and I'll bugger off!!

There are examples of adding player spawn points in the .cfg files included with the Stripper2 plugin download (look at the crossfire .cfg file for example).

Different MODs will use different methods of creating spawn points (i.e. Half-Life deathmatch isn't the same as TFC and it isn't the same as Counter-Strike, etc.).

If you have problems creating spawn points using Stripper2, you should specify which MOD you are trying to create spawn points for.

(This is for Counter Strike)

In order to have more bots/ players per side you have to add in more spawn points. I know of two ways to do this. You can “hack” the map and add in more spawn point or you can use Botman’s stripper2 tool to add in spawn points on the fly.
1)First read about spawn points here:
“making 32 player maps”
http://www.joe.to/32players.html

This describes how to hack a map to add in more spawn points. It explains players per side and spawn points pretty well. You would use zoner's ripent.exe to export the entity portion of the bsp file, modify it and then use ripent.exe to import your changes to the map. There is no problem with your maps being out of sync with other server's maps since the entity portion of the map is handled all server side.

=> If you modify a map on your client machine you will NOT DL the original map when you connect to some server

=> If you modify a map on your dedicated server clients connectiong to your server will NOT DL your hacked map BUT they WILL get the changes you made to the entities!

2) Download this tool to find out how many spawn point each maps has.
Gatez's Advanced Mapcycler
http://lappi.skai.fi/~mikkoko/advancedmapcycler/

This is a tool that will go through all of your maps at once and list how many spawn points each map has and you can export the list to a text file.

3)Go to Botman’s site and read about and download His stripper2 tool.
http://www.planethalflife.com/botman/
Be sure to go to his tools fourm and read about how you use stripper2

I have used stripper2, metamod, and PODBots on my dedicated server and I run 16-24 bots against 3-4 humans + a few bots. Great fun!

You MUST be sure to place spawn points at least 82 units apart otherwise at round start one player/bots will die and sometimes leave a ghost model stuck in the floor.

I used to use stripper2 but now I have written a Metamod utility that shows where all spawn points are and you can just run around the map placing / removing spawnpoints and most weapons and simply save your changes back to the map! 
If you want it email me.
