well in fact the problem is that sound is not always active and can be breakable (it s an old juke box model).

here what entities i can find with bsp tool

--------------------------------
Entity index      : 82
Entity origin (X) : 0.000000
              (Y) : 0.000000
              (Z) : 0.000000
First brush       : 0
Number of brushes : 0
Key/Value         : classname/ambient_generic
Key/Value         : spawnflags/8
Key/Value         : message/ambience/Opera.wav
--------------------------------
Entity index      : 140
Entity origin (X) : 0.000000
              (Y) : 0.000000
              (Z) : 0.000000
First brush       : 0
Number of brushes : 0
Key/Value         : classname/func_breakable
Key/Value         : rendercolor/0 0 0
Key/Value         : targetname/radio
Key/Value         : target/operaWav
--------------------------------------

my question is what i have to remove and add ?

thx for support. peace

The entity you want is, 

Entity index      : 82 
Entity origin (X) : 0.000000 
             (Y) : 0.000000 
             (Z) : 0.000000 
First brush       : 0 
Number of brushes : 0 
Key/Value         : classname/ambient_generic 
Key/Value         : spawnflags/8 
Key/Value         : message/ambience/Opera.wav 

But the origin is wrong. If you can find the exact origin of the entity:

[strip]
ambient_generic (X Y Z)

[add]
{
classname/ambient_generic 
spawnflags/8 
message/ambience/yoursound.wav
origin/X Y Z
}

Then create a res file for the map that has
ambience/yoursound.wav
So that the sound will be downloaded to your players.

Come to think of it, since its the only ambiet that came up, you can just:

[strip]
ambient_generic

And then re-add it some place  close to where the former sound was.

      origin/1008 2320 174
      spawnflags/8

}

Remove teh space in the .wav name. Make it f**k_opera.wav

And make sure its the right sound format.

QUOTE:
You don't need the .wav file inserted into the .pak file.  Just stick it in the tfc\sound folder.

Make sure you PRECACHE the sound in the Stripper2 .cfg file.

Also make SURE the sound is the right format (11Khz or 22Khz, 8 bit, PCM encoding).

After strip, shouldn't there be brackets? I have never used stripper2, so i would not know. It is a guess.

Like this:

[Strip]
{
blahblahblah
}

In the strip area you don't need { }.

It should work, do you have stripper working right? Have you tried adding other things?

How can i find out the origin to strip???

better i state my whole problem, perhaps i get more help ;)

from the bsp-tool dump:
Entity index      : 56
Entity origin (X) : 0.000000
              (Y) : 0.000000
              (Z) : 0.000000
First brush       : 0
Number of brushes : 0
Key/Value         : classname/func_button
Key/Value         : spawnflags/257
Key/Value         : netname/func_button 1
Key/Value         : target/bfdoor1
Key/Value         : health/1
Key/Value         : wait/3
Key/Value         : speed/20
Key/Value         : sounds/3
Key/Value         : renderamt/0
Key/Value         : renderfx/0
Key/Value         : rendermode/0

Key/Value         : locked_sentence/0
Key/Value         : unlocked_sentence/0
Key/Value         : angles/0 90 0
Key/Value         : model/*35

This is a button, triggering a door. And i want another one directly next to it, that is triggering another door bfdoor2.

What to do?

You can not strip an entity by origin if the origin is (0, 0, 0).

You MUST remove ALL entities of this name, then add back in all of the original entities with their original key/value pairs (except for the one that you want to change, which should have modified key/value pairs).

For example, if you are trying to strip a single func_water (a brush entity that has NO origin), you don't do this...
code:
[strip]
func_water (0,0,0)

[add]
{
classname/func_water
origin/0 0 0
model/*75
}

Instead, you do this...
code:
[strip]
func_water  // strip them ALL out

[add]
{
classname/func_water
model/*34  // water #1
}

{
classname/func_water
model/*13  // water #2
}

{
classname/func_water
model/*62  // water #3
}

etc.

The reason you CAN'T strip out entities that have no origin (i.e. entities with origin 0,0,0) is because ALL of the entities of that type have no origin and there's no way to distiguish one from another.

If I was continuing to work on the Stripper2 plugin, I could modify things so that you could specify the key and value that you wanted to use to make entities unique and use that to strip them out.  For example something like this might be nice...
code:
[strip]
func_water (key=model/value=*13)

[add]
{
classname/func_water
model/*13  // we only have to add back the one we stripped
}

But since I'm NOT continuing to work on the Stripper2 plugin, this likely won't happen (unless someone else from the coding community is willing to pick this up and run with it, hint, hint).

good good, that's a first answer and get me a little further. i will strip all func_button. But where do I find the origins for re-adding the buttons ? ? ? ? ?
EDIT: ok, no origin. adding func_button's without origin works ;)

(My coder-skill is little, which language do you use and how many lines stripper2 has about)

The Stripper2 source code is all C++.

It's only a couple of hundred lines of code, but it's not the number of lines that matters, it's HOW complex the code is relative to your level of understanding the language.  If you don't know C++ VERY WELL, learn it first, then try modifying the Stripper2 source code.
