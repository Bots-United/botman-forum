  I have spawn in miniterrets, terrets, and sentals, but the will not fire at people.  Is there something I need to add to the map.sr.cfg.  I want to put them in to camping places to run off people.  Thanks for any help.

Have you looked at any mapping tutorials on how to create sentry guns?  That would be the best place to start.  Try the valve-erc.com website.

You have to have the "Auto-Start" flag.
