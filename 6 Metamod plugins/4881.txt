Do you have metamod working with CS 1.6?

   Sure do, If I have it set to execute at all in the plugins.ini (addons/metamod directory) then the server won't come up at all. Take that line out, server pops up. Am I alone in my problem : /?

scare,
  I am using the latest metamod v1.16.2 and I have 2 1.6 servers both using stripper2 plus 8 other metamod plugins.

  I have a 24 plyr pub server that we want to up to 32 but office and italy are very popular on our server.  I wanted to add spawn points to the maps that do not support 16 per team.

  I had to do it all from scratch but I have learned alot.  I have fixed the following maps to hold 16 per team and keep the spawn points in a good location:

Italy
Office
Siege
Militia
Assualt (actually used 8 spwn points from the sample config file)
Wall (the cts on this map faced the wrong way so I removed them all and flipped them around using stripper2)

good luck,
puff

If you want an easy way to add / remove spawn points in maps email me and I can send you my metamod map editing utility.

You simply start a LAN game and run around the map adding /removing items like spawn points and guns and grenades and then save it right back to the bsp file.

It works great!

I'm using latest metamod, and used stripper for at least a year on 1.5 . We have two 24 player servers, and I have spawn points installed for over 50 maps, as well as banners in all the maps. However, no matter what I do, The server will not load with stripper 2 enabled on 1.6 .

  Austin bot, wouldnt ppl have to download the modified .bsp's? or does it not save to the actual bsp. I love stripper2, but half the ppl I know that ran it on 1.5 can't run it with 1.6 . Some can without a problem. I don't know why.

Any physical modifications to the bsp files will change the checksum and force a download (or cause problems in terms of pre-existing maps on the client side).

Stripper2 gets around this by spawning dynamically. Hence no map download requirements.

Nope. The checksum only applies to the map BSP data, and *NOT* the entities data. You can have a map having the same BSP data as the original, but with ladders put elsewhere, monsters here or there, and half a dozen more spawn points if you want, all this saved back in a new .bsp file, and your players won't need to download the map.

When players connect a game server, before the server creates a baseline for them in the network "pack", it sends them all the entities data so that they update themselves and synchronize with the server. A basic checksum is also made to ensure the BSP data is the same, and if all this passes, the client is allowed in game, using the same BSP data (from local file) and the same entity data (from server through network) as everyone else on this server.

I have been using stripper2 with 1.5 and now have it running on my 1.6 Test server.  It works great and had NO issues setting it up.

i got problems with 1.6 and steam too
im running a linux server
mm, adminmod, stripper2, hlguard, webmod

sometimes it works fine :)
sometimes it doesnt :(

if its not working try deleting the file "custom.hpk" in ur cstrike directory and then restart your server.
often this does the job...
