Excuse for my English! 
In search engine I don't see the answer to my question.
A question such. How in a file map_str.cfg correctly to register new places for the weapon?
I using bsp_viewer bring coordinates for the weapon, but leaves nothing. 
And one more question. Whether it is possible to change color of letters B O T M A N with yellow?
Thanks!!!

Are you asking how to create a outside text file with the current camera position so that you can place items there later (possibly using Stripper2 or ripent)?

If so, just open a text file using fopen() in append mode ("a"), write the current camera position to the file using fprintf() and then close the file.  Each time you open the file it will append a line to the end of the file with the current X,Y,Z value of the camera.  You might want to open and close the file (not in append mode) each time the program starts so that the file will be empty.

No, you can't change the colors of the decals placed in the map.  The color is controlled by the palette index color in the valve\decals.wad file.  If you use a WAD viewer (like Wally), it will show you what the decal color is by examining the decal and looking at the last color in the palette (index 255).

Thanks!!!
It's worked (new weapon places) very well.
But when I have new weapon parameter "count/" don't use more items. 
I have no-standart map on my CS 1.5 Server and  give count/100 on item 15 (Hegrenade), but use 1 HEgrenade
