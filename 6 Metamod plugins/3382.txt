Hi, 

Me new to the forums cause i really wanted to ask this question to botman...

Will the next version of Monster mod have ALL of the HL monsters?  

I really REALLY wanna see ichasaurus(must have that freaky call it does) (w/e it is called)  I wish it would have those sharks in HL, the boss from opposing force (ROFL if its possible...which i doubt it cause the monster has to probably be in HL only)  and any other FREAKY monsters like gargantua

Put all those in your next monster mod version botman! :)

k thnx bye

P.S. what other monsters can be possible?

I'd be more intrested in people creating custom monsters to add, that'd be neat :).

that would mean that people would have to d-load the monster before they play on the server...I dont want them to know that there is going to be a monster in CS....i just want to drop one out of no where, in their face while they are camping...

Hey botman (if you are listening) Are you gonna put more monsters into the next version? All HL monsters that can be put into it would be nice :) hehe

I will probably add more monsters in the next release of the Monster plugin.  It will probably be a month or so before the next release of the Monster plugin.

Botman please add SUPER crazy monsters...like the boss from HL....open the .pak file using HLMV in the valve folder and look at the insane amount of monsters.  Get as many as you can in the next release and you are a secksy man!!!

hehe botman you 0wn, 

today i put like 5 big mommas, 1 apache, and random other monsters on cs_assault and it was sooooooo funny.  Then my friend went crazy and put like 20 apaches inside the warehouse and my FPS was .00003 LOL

k thnx buh bye


omfg i just noticed in that .pak file theres a .mdl called "forklift"....its a guy on a forklift...is it posible to make him drive around a map on CS running people down?!

list of monsters that should be put in: :)

-gargantua
-HL boss
-long neck thing that sticks out of ground (tentacle)
-icky the shark
-leeches....lol
-nihilanth....
-the osprey...cause its soo big an intimidating
-stuka bat.....

and anything you think is awesome..k just wanted to make some suggestions....you dont have to go thru ALL the truoble to put them in..as i know its prob really hard...but i would love it if you did :)

I'm running nihilanth in crossfire with stripper2 and there is no appreciable additional lag...I don't have a lot of other monsters but a few like zombie and some alien slaves...everyone seems to team up to kill nihilanth and the lighting and laser beams are great when he dies

I'll probably be adding some of the water based monsters in the next release (icthyosaur and leeches).

The next release may not be for another month or too since I'm currently in the process of packing up all my stuff and moving.
