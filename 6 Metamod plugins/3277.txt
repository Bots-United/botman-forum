can change the monster sound?
like in ur source botman

const char *CMZombie::pIdleSounds[] = 
{
      "zombie/zo_idle1.wav",
      "zombie/zo_idle2.wav",
      "zombie/zo_idle3.wav",
      "zombie/zo_idle4.wav",
};
but didn have a compiler :)


take some resident evil sound in it? and write the new sound in the ...res file
and monster.cfg, too
or a new model.mdl 4 a monster?

or in the future a little prog, 4 import new monsters 8)

jeah some crasy ideas, and hard work 2,but
i think make more a combinate work with the stripperplugin, 2 realism this ideas easylA :)

This doesn't require any code.  Just extract the sounds from the valve\pak0.pak file into the valve\sound folder (create it if it doesn't exist).

Leave the file names exactly the way they are but replace the contents with other .wav file sounds (you will need to make sure it's 11Khz or 22Khz 8bit mono sound files).

botman

Well i have done this using the " They hunge mod files" 
sounds for monster zombie and the *.mdl files.
If you want an easy way here how i did it for CS.
First copy the sound\zombie folder in the valve\pak0.pak  (You need wally to explore the pak file!) And paste it in to cstrike\sound\
Then replace the *.waw (Sound files) U want!
(To replace simple delete it an use the same name for the new *.waw file)

The *mdl files goes to "cstrike\models" If you have they hunger then do this is freakin cool . Its almost like resident evil...

botman, can u make in the next version, a new cvar, for extra to load the map.cfg

"monster player zombie" its cool,
but must "monster_spawn 1" and then will be automatic load (when it existence) a map.cfg :(
