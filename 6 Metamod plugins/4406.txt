Hello,
I'll try stripper2 with cs but only sprites and teleporters will work but no weapons.
What means this error in my Logfile?:

This...

"WARNING! "classname" key not found in the followin"

...indicates a problem with your .cfg file.

I'm not sure why Stripper2 thinks the classname key wasn't present in each group, since you clearly have one there.  The code checks for "classname/" and then a key name (note that you can't have a space between the "classname" and the "/" (which it appears that you don't).

The only thing I can think of is that you have some other garbage in the .cfg file that is confusing the Stripper2 file parser.

Is the .cfg file that you posted the ENTIRE file or just a snippet.  If it's not the entire .cfg file, post that.  You might also want to try cutting-and-pasting a group from one of the Stripper2 example .cfg files just to make sure that you don't have some strange characters (control characters, etc.) in there.

Yes, there was two spaces before "classname", now it works, thanks
