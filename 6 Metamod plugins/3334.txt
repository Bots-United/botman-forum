I had everything setup and working last night, monster would spwan and everything. Then when I came back to my server today it had stopped working. Now when I restart the server i get the following message:

[MONSTER] ERROR: No monster key found!

I check and the de_dust_monster.cfg file is still in the cstrike/maps directory. Any idea what has gone wrong???

Thank You
