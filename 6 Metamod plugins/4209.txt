I want to add something that's both visible and solid, that you can walk/jump on, to get to places that you usually can't.

I guess func_wall, but would that work?.. Can I get it with textures?...

If by "add something" you mean using Stripper2, you can't add your own custom brush models (most often used by 'func_wall') since these can only be created using a level editor (ala Worldcraft) and the BSP file must be recompiled for these brush models to exist.

You can spawn a model in the game (for example a snark model, or a gib model of a skull, etc.) and set that to solid with a bounding box by using that for the model of an entity.  There are many entities that you can spawn that will be solid.  'monster_furniture' would probably work, I'd try it first.

If you want something that looks like a crate (or other object), you would probably need to create your own custom model (using something like Milkshape) and precache that model before spawning it in your level.

Get the .fgd file for the MOD that you are running.

The .fgd file is used by Worldcraft/Hammer to create entities in maps.  It's just a text file and can be opened with any text editor (like Notepad).

There will be render properties associated with each entity.  Things that can be rendered with a glowing shell (like the flags in TFC), things that can be rendered transparent, and other rendering effects can be determined by seeing what properties an entity inherits from in the .fgd file.

The .fgd file can be downloaded at just about any Half-Life mapping tutorial website (like at collective.valve-erc.com/VERC for example).
