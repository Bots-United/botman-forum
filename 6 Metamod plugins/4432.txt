Loving it...works great.

Only one problem ive found--maybe it will help.
When you spawn a GARG and hgrunts,and the Garg goes to attack the hgrunts--server crashes with a host_error: write_dest error: not a client.
Thats the only problem ive ran across.
Good work!

This also happens when garg kills a client in your server.It does happen in many instances.Also Dude Fix Barnacle Spawning,make it spawn ABOVE player,and make APACHE spawn above player,i wanna spawn barnacles to the roof not in front of me,and i wanna spawn apaches without them shooting themselves.Some mods of monster mod has already done that apache spawns above player.Its very itchy trying to place barnacle or apache in correct position(barnacle being 10 cent away from roof...),apache going above map limits.Also why doesnt Bloater pick up infonodes when it sees them?btw i wont use gargantua if it crashes when it kills enybody else than the host(if gargantua kills other monsters it still crashes).So far only clients/host/other monsters can kill garg without server crashing and going to console show the error.If garg kills other monsters or clients it crashes.

also spawning to many ichthyosaurs does same as garg killing player thing.you also should fix leech behauvior.They stop moving and attacking after certain time,theyll just stay there and i cant kill em then either.

i have just change it so nothing can hurt gargantua except player, also gargantua can ONLY hurt player, it will have no effect on other monster! It is funny to see the hgrunt and gargantua fighting eaching other without damage :) It will be upload to my website within few days! i will post here once the update is upload

you can use bullet to kill it. or just use rocket to attack its legs until i found out how to fix it

in both normal HL and Monstermod ya can fly thru the gargantua to(try to drop on the big  boy,you will fall thru him).I think it relates to the rocket bug somekind then.

HL_Player, if you keep my informed when you come out with new releases I can take care of the linux port for you. bs@bs-linux.com and knowing what files you've updated would help as well.
