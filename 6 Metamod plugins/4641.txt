try this cords..  

0 0 400


the last set (300) is the height... the 0 0 is dead center of the map,right over the center of the bridge.. all you will need to do is adjust the height hight # will raise it lower will lower it.. i think the bridge is at 100, so 400 should be right..

btw you cant get an apache to fly really, all it will do is spin a circle and mow eveyone down..

hope this helps..
