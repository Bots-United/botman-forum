I've been trying to strip the spawn points and the light entities from some maps in Vampire Slayer, I tried the hard way decompiling and then recompiling a new csg without success (atleast for lighting).

When I add
[strip]
{
classname/light_environment
origin/x y z
}

It logs the error Unknown Entity (or whatever, I'm not with my server so I can't check) light_environment. Is it even possible to edit lighting without recompiling the entire map?

I'm also having a problem trying to remove and add spawn points, again it tells me it can't find the entity(ies), in VS the spawns are info_player_slayer and info_player_vampire.

I know I can move these by simply recompiling the entities in the map, but I'd rather move them with stripper.

I know stripper works with VS as I've managed to strip and add new worldspawns.

Am I trying to do the impossible?

The strip section doesn't use the bracket and key/value pair tags.  Just use this...
code:
[strip]
light_environment

...or...
code:
[strip]
light_environment (100, -350, 970)

...assuming that the light_environment that you wanted to strip had an origin of (100, -350, 970).

For the spawn points it would be...
code:
[strip]
info_player_slayer (-450, 370, 1530)
info_player_slayer (925, -1045, 1560)
info_player_vampire (100, -540, 700)

...and so on.
