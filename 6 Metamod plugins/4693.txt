Is one of the skies named "neb2rt.tga" or is there more between neb2 and rt? To get the correct sky name, copy everythingthing before the up, rt, lt, dn, etc... and if its a custom texture, make sure the server sends the graphics over to the client on connect.

Are there any 'neb2*' files in the tfc\gfx\env directory?  If so, then all 6 of them must be there for it to load properly.

Half-Life has these sky textures in the pak0.pak file...

2desert, alien1, alien2, alien3, black, city, cliff, desert, dusk, morning, neb1, neb2, neb6, neb7, night, space, xen8, xen9, xen10

...so if you don't have any 'neb2' files in your tfc\gfx\env directory, it should load them from the valve\pak0.pak file.

If you do have any neb2 files in tfc\gfx\env, you will need all six:

neb2bk.tga, neb2dn.tga, neb2ft.tga, neb2lf.tga, neb2rt.tga, neb2up.tga

...if any of them are missing, it won't work.  You can try deleting them from tfc\gfx\env if any of them are there and the pak0.pak file versions should be used.

Doooh!  I just looked in the .pak file.

It actually should be 'neb2b' not 'neb2'.

the recon gamer server dont have a pak0pak file ,but i did make a gfx/env file system and added the neb2b tga files in it ,it downloads them ,along with the res. file but it still uses the default skybox.

I also tried the space skybox and still dont work.
