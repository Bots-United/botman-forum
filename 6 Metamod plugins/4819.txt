How would I change the value of team resources (marines) and player resources (aliens) ?

edict_t *pPlayer = INDEXENT (playerindex);
pPlayer->v.resources = value;

what is the name of the variable that stores player resources, if that is even how I would do it?

and how would I change the marine (team) resources?

The resources are held in 

pPlayer->v.vuser4.z/100;

(Mike C, told me :D)

I don't know if you can change them updating that (resources*100), because I don't know if it's just updated as a reference.

You can change the resources by updating it, but the game immediately sets the resources back to what they "should" be.  If the resources are set at each StartFrame(), the resource display will show a static resource value (say, 100/100), but the player will not REALLY have those resources, it only shows the number.

Any ideas?
