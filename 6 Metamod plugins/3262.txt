Well i have it for cs... And it works great.
Make sure you names the cfg file right. 
Example: cs_assault_monster.cfg and make sure the file is in the map dir 

example: cstrike\maps\cs_assault_monster.cfg

if it this is correct you may made something wrong in the cfg file. you can take min assault with apache copy and paste:

{
origin/-632 1218 480
delay/90
monster/apache
}

This make an apache on assault which i know works.

Are you using Linux?  If so, transfer the .cfg files in FTP using ASCII mode from a PC (or simply create them yourself using vi).  You can also run dos2unix on them to get rid of the linefeeds at the ends of the line.

Turn on the monster_log option in metaexec.cfg like this...
code:
monster_log 1

...and enable logging on your server (add "-log on" to the command line or put "log on" in your server.cfg or autoexec.cfg file).

Then look in the cstrike/logs directory at the most recent .log file.  If should have "[MONSTER]" lines in it.  It will probably say "Error: invalid monster name" which means you have spelled the monster name wrong or (more likely) have linefeeds at the end of each line from transfering the .cfg file from a PC using binary mode in FTP instead of ASCII mode.
