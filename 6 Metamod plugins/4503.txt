is there anyway that admins (amx) could summon monsters anytime they wanted to. if theres is, is there a way to spawn them on all players at once, and is there a way to spawn by coordinates.

Admins could do it if someone created an AMX plugin that issues the Monster console commands when an Admin gives the proper commands.

I don't know if such an AMX plugin exists already or not.  Try searching the AMXmod forum for a plugin that works with the Monster metamod plugin (does AMXmod even work with metamod?).

You have too many monsters precached.

This error message is covered in the Monster plugin ReadMe.txt file.  Read that.

u should be able to precache all mosnters...

neway, so there is no admin cmds to sommon monsters that have been precached? caz im the only one who can summon monsters, since i run a linux server and the onlyh way to summon a monster is to type it in the xterm, its really annoying. i need an admin cmd that all the admins on the server can use whenever they want to.

No, all entities must be precached before any clients join the game.  You can't precache something after clients have joined, because part of the joining code in the engine sends a list of all precached entities from the server to the client (so that the client knows which entities to precached).

You may notice that occasionally when you connect to a server, you see it downloading resources from the server.  This is the part where the precached entities that don't already exist on the client are being sent from the server to the client.  This method only happens before the client has actually joined the game.  Once the client is in the game, if the server were to precache an entity that didn't exist on the client, the client would not be able to render that entity, so Valve designed the engine so that all entities MUST be precached up front and any missing entites on the client will be downloaded from the server at connect time.

No, there are no plans to change the Monster plugin.

If you want AMX admin command support, you will have to create an AMX plugin that does this yourself (or get someone who creates AMX plugins to make one for you).
