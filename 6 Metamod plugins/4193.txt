Use SprWiz and specify each bitmap (image1.bmp, image2.bmp, image3.bmp, etc.) to build the sprite from.

I believe you can only have 10 images in an animated sprite file.  Also, it is common to use 1/10sec per frame for animated sprites (I don't know if this is REQUIRED or not, you'll have to play with it and see).  At 1/10sec per frame and 10 frames max, your animation can only last for 1 second.
