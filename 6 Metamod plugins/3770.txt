i typed 'meta list' in console and it says that both Stripper and Monster are present.

on the map "skyd2" for TFC i've put this in my maps folder as skyd_monster.cfg

{
origin/-1155 150 -3932
delay/10
monster/bigmomma
}


here is my skyd_str.cfg
[add]
//backpack by health
{
PRECACHE_SPRITE(models/penguin.mdl)
origin/-622 -2220 -3932
angles/0 180 0
armorvalue/50
health/50
no_grenades_2/0
ammo_medikit/20
noise/hgrunt/shit
no_grenades_1/0
ammo_nails/50
ammo_rockets/50
ammo_cells/50
ammo_shells/50
wait/1
model/models/penguin.mdl
g_e/1
g_a/1
classname/info_tfgoal
}


there is no gonarch and there is no backpack that looks like a penguin, why? the penguin model is there. i used to have this stripper config for a lot of my maps and it did in fact work, anything which could be wrong?

"here is my skyd_str.cfg"

I assume you meant "here is my skyd2_str.cfg" since Stripper2 won't load the "skyd_str.cfg" file if the map is called "skyd2".
