You don't have metamod running, or you haven't installed the Monster plugin correctly.

Does the monster plugin show up in the list of metamod plugins when the game is running (I forgot the metamod command to list active plugins, but it's in the metamod documentation).

Show the output from the metamod command listing the plugins that are loaded.
