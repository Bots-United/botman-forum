I used to have the original Stripper program running on a regular HLDS. I recently installed Admin Mod so I am still a bit of a n00b with it, but if anyone has managed to get Stripper 2 running as a plug-in could you please post some instructions.

Thx

The instructions are included in the Stripper2 zip file.  Read the ReadMe.txt file.  It explains how to install a metamod plugin.  AdminMOD is also a metamod plugin, so if you have AdminMOD installed, you also have metamod installed.  Just edit the metamod.ini file to include the stripper2_mm DLL (for Windows) or .so file (for Linux).
