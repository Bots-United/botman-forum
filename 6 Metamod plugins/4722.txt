I wrote a plugin to keep a minimum number of bots on my server but I can't get the command to add a bot working.

This is for a DS server running POD 2.5 and my metamod utility.

if (totalBots < 28)
{
  sprintf (command, "\"addbot 60 2 4 Bot%02d\"", totalBots+1); 
  CVAR_SET_STRING("pb", command);
  LOG_CONSOLE(PLID,command); 
}

The log console shows the syntax of the command is correct but no bot is ever added. Why doesn't this work?
Thanks.

dont put the command in quotes (\" & \") I have a feeling HL thinks its one whole command, I think H should sort this out anyway once in the set cvar function..

i.e.

sprintf (command, "addbot 60 2 4 Bot%02d", totalBots+1);
