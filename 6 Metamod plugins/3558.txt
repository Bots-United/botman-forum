Is the any way to add the number of grenades to a given class of player. I/E, Instead of a sargent in DOD carrying 1 grenade can you make him carry 2? I have looked through the help files and see way of placing weapons on maps but not adding more to a player using stripper...

You would have to write a server side mod
