Hello from Germany-Berlin!

Im working with monster and stripper2 for the MOD Counter Strike!

spawning a apache as a Monster in assault is no Problem in cs_assault_monster.cfg

spawning a apache as a normal Model in same Map with Stripper is ok too!

But....this stupid thing only rotates! I´ve tried with path_corner and stuff to make it move from a to B! Doesn´t work.

Is it possible?

path_corners are not available in CS. Another possiblity might be to use a func_train to get the apache to fly around. I looked into it briefly but am not sure it is possible using Stripper2.

@STUMPER: Thanx anyway. I tried exacly that example before I posted here.

@desNotes. I will try it with func_train. Maybe it works. Have you got an example (that working with cs) for me?

@the Rest: Heeeeeeellp! I dont like stupid Apaches! :-)

No problem--
I had tried it briefly in TFC but didnt spend much time on it. I dont do CS.
DO the path corners function in TFC or try the func_train way?

You can't.  The monster_apache entity doesn't normally respawn when you kill it.  Think of how difficult that would make things in the single player game if the apache kept respawning everytime you killed it.  In general, none of the monsters from single player will respawn when you kill them.
