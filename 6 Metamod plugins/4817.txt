so the new tfc has a bug that crashes server due to not precaching a model and Im thinking I can do a temp fix using monster or stripper perhaps, whatcha think? Heres the error below, couldn't I just precache thhe teleporter model myself with stripper, or model or something? 

FATAL ERROR (shutting down): Host_Error: PF_precache_model_I:
'models/teleporter.mdl' Precache can only be done in spawn functions

looks like it might work, I used stripper to precache the model and this time it crashed on misc/teleport_out.wav instead of hte model file :)

Yes, using Stripper2 to precache any model, sound or sprite should prevent this crashing problem if the MOD is buggy.

Be aware that precaching TOO much stuff can cause some maps not to load (due to too many resources being loaded into memory), but precaching just a few resources (less than a dozen) shouldn't cause any problems unless the map is already REALLY large and very close to the limit.

This seems to fix teleporters in TFC using stripper2

[strip]

[add]

PRECACHE_MODEL(models/teleporter.mdl)
PRECACHE_SOUND(misc/teleport_out.wav)
PRECACHE_SOUND(misc/teleport_in.wav)
PRECACHE_SOUND(misc/teleport_ready.wav)
PRECACHE_SPRITE(sprites/particle.spr)

Botman,

So I've discovered that most TFC servers do not have this precache problem with teleporters. Alfred Reynolds at VALVe cannot reproduce the problem. And I know that stripper2 can spawn teleporters so since the problem with steam is teleporter related I'm wondering if stripper2 (or perhaps monster) is causing it. I run metamod and three plugins: Stripper2, Monster and Sparkies v2 (server side). I dont run adminmod amx or anything else. I do run halfd and my custom HPB_bot code. But I doubt halfd or my bot code cause this. So whatcha think? Stripper2 a possible candidate?

I'll do some testing this weekend to prove this if need be...

I'm not sure what might be causing the precache error.  Stripper2 doesn't precache anything on its own (unless you have a PRECACHE_XXX in the .cfg file).  The Monster plugin only precaches things needed by the monsters (monster sounds, monster sprite effects, monster models, etc.).

The simplest way that I can figure out what would be causing the problem is to remove EVERYTHING and start adding things back, one by one, until the problem shows back up and then you'll know what caused the problem.  It sounds like it's pretty reproducable (happens every time), so it shouldn't take long to start the server up with one new thing at a time and see when it crashes.

as a followup I believe it is a problem in the HPB_bot code that is creating the teleporter precache problem.
