Will the monster plugin work with the store bought version of CS, or just the mod?  Anyone tried?

It should work with HLDS as there is only one version of HLDS. Not sure about listen servers though...

You can run both a dedicated server and a client from the same machine, you will need a decent computer to do it though.

He's asking about the retail version of Counter-Strike.

If the retail version includes the "valve" subdirectory (which I think it does) and the valve subdirectory contains a pak0.pak file (which I think it does), the retail version should work just fine with the Monster metamod plugin.

I don't have the retail version of Counter-Strike (and won't be getting it), so I can't tell you for sure.
