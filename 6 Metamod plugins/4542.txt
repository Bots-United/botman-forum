My servers both have monster mod, but you wont see it running unless you do something that warrents getting banned. I like to torture them first :).

And typicly I'm the only one who ever runs it since most of the .id admins don't know the commands/don't care to use them.

I run MonsterDM server that has monsters in eeach map. It is dedicated and runs most of the time except lately I am working to convert it to Linux so it may be unavailable at times

See his comment... "but you wont see it running unless you do something that warrents getting banned".

He only spawns the monsters (manually) to torment people.  He doesn't have the monsters spawning all the time.
