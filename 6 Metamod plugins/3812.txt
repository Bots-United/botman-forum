the entity is func_breakable. But I doubt you will be able to use the entity on 2fort.

Heres a small config of the grate on 2fort , its breakable and looks like glass when it breaks, my guess would be that you would have to find the coordinates to rotate this sucker so you can use it as a wall for people to break through.
Change the renderamt and renderfx around until it looks clear enough like glass. I hope this helps you. material/2 makes it break like glass i think.
{      
      { 
            classname/func_breakable 
            origin/-400 -600 0
            model/*1
            health/200
            material/2
            renderfx/16 
            explodemagnitude/100
            renderamt/50                           
      } 
}

There are grates just over the entry way to the fort coming off of the bridge (on both sides).  The grate makes up the floor in the room above the entry way to each fort (from the bridge).

You can use my BSP tools to dump the brush models contained in a map and there will be a "min" and "max" value for the brush model.  If you subtract the "min" value from the "max" value, this will give you the size of the brush model.
