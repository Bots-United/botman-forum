for the map 2fort, everybody has like 250 ping. they say that the packet loss and choke are 0 but the ping is bad....the only thing i changed about the config for that map is to take out the assassins (hate thos things). on the map well i only added 3 hgrunts and the lag is not really hard. for the map casbah which has no monsters at all, people have like 150 ping which is good and normal.

since TFC does not have built in monsters and stuff, does it have to upload all the stuff that is going on to all the clients similar to having more people connected? i mean, does having a monster cause equivalent lag to having a human to make it so that when i have 16 humans on 2fort with tons of monsters it's really like having 25 people on a simple DSL server?

Nothing gets "uploaded" to the clients.  They already have everything they need in the valve\pak0.pak file.

The lag is caused by the large number of entities constanly being sent from the server to the player for effects (like gun shots, explosions, squidspit sprites moving through the air).  Everytime you add a monster you create lag.  The more monster you have (or the more entities they create), the more lag you will have.  The only way to reduce lag is to reduce the number of monsters.

As far as I can tell all the lag is client side...

I run UD cancer research, hlserver, IIS and an IRC bot off my server and even with the monster program the server fps doesn't drop bellow 99 (assuming the server is empty :)). The machine is hardly state of the art...

hmmm ... reduce the number of monsters? how. Lately, i added about 30-40 controller, and my ping went up to 4000. The only way to get rid of them was a changelevel.
How about a monster-removal command?

If you added 40 controllers, just delete thirty of them from the CFG file and you now have a permanent solution to lag problems (that is, if you added them to a map).

If you just spawned them next to a player, just kill the monster. (or use snarks instead).
