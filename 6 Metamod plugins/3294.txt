I'm running a linux dedicated server with CS
I just upgraded monster to 2.0.  It seems to work as described in the readme.  However, the monsters don't do any damage to the players.

anybody else try this yet?

nothing discourages awp campers like 500hp zombies!

Oppps, I screwed up.  I was commenting out the code that does damage to a player to test some stuff and I forgot to uncomment it.

I will build a new release and upload it.  The new release will be 2.1

Okay, it's fixed now.  ;D

You'll have to download the 2.1 version and use it instead.
