Has anyone ever made a working and confirmed config that has a train and or vehicle in it? I am interested in loosing sleep over this.  I got ripent and interestingly enough in a hl dm map that has a train (subtransit) there is no func_train not even traincontrols or tracktrain just path_track.. very odd.

Anyway let me know of any code that you can confirm works for making a train and or vehicle in tfc.

Thank you

actualy there is a func_tracktrain.. but I would think there would be some sort of controls to control it (since there are some in the map)...
