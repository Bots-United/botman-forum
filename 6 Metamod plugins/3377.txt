Does it work with HL deathmatch?
When my server starts, the console says it loaded it, but no monsters ever spawn from the map specific files. I have allow monsters and spawn monsters set to 1. I commented out the monsters I want to spawn in the monster_precache file. I also have stripper2 which works fine.

make a "metaexec.cfg" write "monster_log 1" in there.

OK, I did that and checked the logs. BTW, I was testing adding agrunts and bigmomma into the game.(Agrunts I add with no prob using stripper2). The logs said:

"[MONSTER] Processing config file=C:\Sierra\Half-Life/valve/monster_precache.cfg
[MONSTER] Precaching agrunt models & sounds...
[MONSTER] Precaching bigmomma models & sounds...
[MONSTER] ERROR: Could not find "C:\Sierra\Half-Life/valve/monster_skill.cfg" (default skill used)
"

I reloaded the map. No luck. It *sounds* like things are working but they aren't. Is there some cvar to add that I'm missing? I get monsters no prob w/ stripper2 using monstermaker.

What are you using to spawn the monster?  Did you create a monster .cfg file?  Here's a very simple monster .cfg file the map crossfire (valve\maps\crossfire_monster.cfg)...
code:
{
origin/-150 650 -1700
delay/10
monster/barney
monster/hgrunt
monster/scientist
}

...it just spawns a human grunt, barney or scientist in the pit area.

P.S. You might want to go ahead and copy the monster_skill.cfg file into the valve directory so you can adjust the health and damage amounts.

I created the file just as you said and to play it safe, c+p 'ed it. Put it in my valve/maps folder and commented back in the monsters to be spawned in the precache cfg file. Nothing spawned. Reloaded the map too. I don't know what it could be.

Why don't you post the map specific monster .cfg file you are using.  Also post ALL the "[MONSTER]" lines from your .log file when starting the server.

Well it started working without me changing anything. You're talking to a guy whose console goes away from time to time for no apparent reason. 

I think my HL is possessed or something heh!
