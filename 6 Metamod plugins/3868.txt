Hey botman...  We use Stripper2 Religiously.  Thanks for helping server admins make there servers a fun place to be.

I'm having some lag issues with our server.  Now I do not know if it is Stripper2 causing it or not.  I am not trying to place the blame on Stripper2 either. I just thaught you may be able to help uswith this issue.  The server is on OC3 lines, so it is not a conectivity issue. Recon Gamer hosts the server, we rent it.

The LAG problem is as follows:

Quite often when a player joins our server, the server will lock up, or lag up, from anywhere around 5 - 20 seconds. It is closer to the 20 on the bigger maps.  Has anyone ever exspeireced this with Stripper2 that you know of?

The other plugins we are using are:

MOTM - no version # available
Chat-Protection - V 1.13

The server is HLDM w/ Admin Mod.

Botman I believe that you are very knowledgeable with the HL Engine, and maybe you could help us with this LAG issue even if it is not Stripper2.

Any assistance would be greatly appriceated,
~[CBS]TJ~

i have run into alot of problems with MOTM, and another of plugin by the same person...  you may want to disable that plugin by putting //in front of it in the plugin.ini   then restart the server...  also, get the latest metamod.dll, and the latest adminmod version...  if that doesnt work disable both plugins and see if it happens...

the best way to find out what wrong is to disable the plugins one at a time and try to join..  you can restart the server in the server control site..  recongamer doesnt usually update everything, i think its up to you..  my clan has a server there too, and i have to update it myself..

OK.. thx I will try updating it this holiday weekend.  Did you do that via FTP?  And if so, is there anything I should know before trying to update Admin Mod and Meta Mod remotly?

Thanks,

yea, you ftp to update stuff..   and when you replace the metamod.dll, rename the old one to metamodold.dll and insert the new one.. then at the next map change you can safeley delete the old dll.. (otherwise you need to shutdown the server to delete the old dll... i never updated adminmod on our server. but i think all you really need to do is update the amdinmod dll...  

i really think that your culprit is MOTM, of all the plugins i have had trouble with my personal server was that one..

Recon Gamer isnt on OC3, its OC192/OC48s, btw hey TJ :).

We had stripper running on our RG server which caused no lag at all.

Hey Lunatic w/ Candy... Nice to see ya.

Well...  We have updated both adminmod and metamod.  We have disabled all plugins, including MOTM and the LAG monster still shows its head.

The LAG is however narrowed down to this:
While players are downloading the map it seems very choppy.  And when they finally enter the map, we get a lag spike, locking up the server for approx. 5-10 secs.

Any suggestions?

And BTW, we have had our game server placed on a diff. machine, and totally reinstalled.

Thanks again gang,

I've noticed that several recon gamer servers have been having lag issues lately, you get a shit server provider, you get shit service, what do you expect?

Past few weeks I've had a few matches on Recon Gamer servers, and in each one everyone's lag spiked. Sometimes as bad to give everyone 200+ pings.

Hey gang... Thanks for the quick responces.

Lunatic W/ Candy: I've known from the beginning when I met ya that you really did not care for Recon. But they provide great customer service and support for us most of the time. They are aware of this issue and are working on it like we are.

AlClockworkOrange: We did turn off download, and viola! All of the lag issues disappeared. Unfortunatly we did not want to miss out on meeting new people in our server. So we re-enabled the download.  We will try those min and max rates.  And I am registered at United Admins. I will go there next.

Do you have any suggestions on a message that can be viewed when people try to enter that tells them where to go to get the maps?  Something diff. than the motd.txt.  Something that tells them when the message pops up that they could not connect because they do not have that map. I think the message calls it a model.

Thanks again gang,
~[CBS]TJ~

Does recon let you mess with rates? I thought they had those locked?

You'll learn to despise Recon :). Just like everyone else who has been screwed by them.

this is what one of our members in my clan posted.. its a message from recon gamers..



Recon Gamer is currently working on the web-system you are housed on, due to a recent, unforeseen problem with the system. The issue is hardware related, and is also causing substantial slow-downs with web-site loads, CGI Script execution, database queries, etc. The current problem should be resolved within the next one to three hours, as we are currently running various diagnostic utilities against the hard-disks of the system you are hosted on.

Recon Gamer is working on a permanent solution to these problems, and we expect to have the issues resolved within the next 7 to 14 days. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we appreciate your patience.

Editing the "This server is using AdminMod message" will not serve your purpose as that is seen only after the client has already downloaded the map.

Since you are already going to United Admins, I would you recommend you get HL guard there if you don't have it already. It comes with a free consgreet that you can edit so the client will see your msg after they connect, but before they enter the game. Mine, for example, tells the client which maps involve a long wait and gives a website where they can download the map much faster.


Do you have any suggestions on a message that can be viewed when people try to enter that tells them where to go to get the maps?
