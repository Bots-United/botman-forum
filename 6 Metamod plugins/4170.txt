Today while playing around with snarks (I discovered that its good practice to fight with them :P) that with the shotgun it is almost impossible to hit the little devils, while the nail guns tear them up easy as pie.

I know its not an error; just wondering if its related to lag compensation? And if this applies like this to the monsters, does this also apply to players? EG its easier to get hits with the nails then with the shotgun? (Something about hitscan weapons?)

The spread of the shotgun probably has a lot to do with this.

If you think of the shotgun firing a 'cone' of buckshot, then anything that is very close to you (like within 20 feet) will only have a small radius where it would get hit.  Things further away would be exposed to a larger radius since the cone spreads out more the further away you get.

Also I know that the nails from the TFC nail gun are actually little 'missles'.  Valve creates a separate entity for each nail and gives it a velocity (just like a little rocket or grenade).  The bounding box for the nail is probably large enough that it touches things fairly easily when they are very close to you.  So that's probably what make them better able to deal with enemies close up.
