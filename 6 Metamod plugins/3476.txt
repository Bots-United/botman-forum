no offense to botman but here goes...lol

I just changed my private server from tfc to cs...I've become a great deal interested in learning about cs from a client and server point of view, so what I'm asking is, what's like the best bot for CS right now?

There is no "best" bot.  You will get many different opinions about which bot is best because it can do "X" and "Y" and "Z".

See the discussion on NukeBox for some opinions...
