Just wondering if there's anything in the SDK about adjusting model sizes? I know it can be done, as I've seen TFC serverside mods that can do it (but have never found one to download).

Is there a way to do this with stripper, or should I just do it with a modeling program?

Want to actualy create this picture :) > http://dynamic3.gamespy.com/~st/forum/attachments/megasg.jpg

Is far as I've experienced, you'll have mdl inconsistancy problems.  Of course you can create a non-functioning extra large sg-like model but you wont be able to subtitute it for the real one not even with a new pak.

That picture looks a LOT like a fake to me.  Someone obviously cut-and-pasted the engineer and sentry gun from a model viewer (or in the game) onto a screen shot of a map.  The reason you can tell it's a fake is the edges around the engineer and sentry gun are TOO SHARP compared to the textures that they would be up against (like at the ground where they should meet).

The only things that I've seen that you can scale up or down in the game is sprites (but not sprites drawn on the HUD).  There's an example of creating a silly little test sprite in the Stripper2 example config file for crossfire.  The default scale is 1.0, but you can make it ten times as large by changing the scale to "10.0".

You can TRY using "env_sprite" to create a model (just like the one in crossfire_str.cfg), but use a model instead of a sprite for the "model" key and specify a scale value other than 1.0 to see what it does.

Let us know if you are able to get this to work.

Nope.  That don't work.  Here's what I tried for crossfire...
code:
[add]

{
   classname/env_sprite
   PRECACHE_SPRITE(models/apache.mdl)
   frame/1
   framerate/10
   renderfx/0
   rendermode/1
   renderamt/255
   scale/10.00
   spawnflags/1  // SF_SPRITE_STARTON
   model/models/apache.mdl
   origin/-345 640 -1300
}

...and you get the helicopter, but no matter what you set "scale" to, it stays the regular size.

I think the scale thing only applies to sprites (not models).

I know the picture is fake, I want to actualy create it though :). If I were to enlarge a model in HLMV I would name it something diffrent to avoid that error, I also know it wouldn't function. I was just wondering if you could scale a model teh way you can scale a texture without having to do any actual work :)

PS: I'll try it with a sprite.

Doesnt work... :(

I added a flag to 2fort above the bridge, changed the scale to 10, and it stayed normal size. Doesn't look like scale does anything with models even as a env_sprite

On the plus side, I created a new flag :).

How did you rescale the model?  Does Milkshape allow you to rescale a model without having to recompile it?  I know you should be able to decompile the model, change the scale in the .qc file, then recompile it using the SDK model compile tools.

There is a tool called FatBoy in milk shape that will make the models a little bigger.

I cant find the tutorial, but it was milkshape and it involes recompiling...

Sorry about the long wait for reply, got a call about this sweet bass that I could get for $100 and I had to take the bait :).

You know where I can get that milkshape plugin?

Ask laser, Author of Rocket Crowbar. He has managed to shrink models in RC2, perhaps he knows how to make them bigger?!! :)

go into adv/tech help forum here :)
