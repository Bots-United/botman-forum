How do you find the right coordinates for the surface of a wall in order to put letters on it?

I.e. will walking up to the wall and typing "status" to get your coordinates give you the correct position? Or do you have to offset your position by some amount of units to reach the surface?

Can letters be placed "in thin air"?

Standing next to the wall will not be close enough.  You will need to add (or subtract) 10 units to your origin to get close enough to the wall.  The infodecal checks a "cube" 10x10x10 for a surface to spray the decal on so you will need to be within 10 units of the wall.

You can tell which way you need to adjust by standing right up against the wall (facing it directly head on).  Use the "status" command and write down the X, Y and Z coordinates.  Get out of the console and TAP the backward key to move straight back, then use the "status" command again and compare these numbers to the previous numbers.  If the X value changed, but the Y didn't (or changed very little), you need to add or subtract about 10 units to the original X value (adding or subtracting based on whether the second numbers were smaller or larger than the first).  If the Y value changed, but the X value didn't (or changed very little), then you need to add/subtract from the original Y value.

If both the X and the Y values changed by about the same amount, then you are at a diagonal wall and will have to adjust both the X and Y values (or simply go find another wall that is parallel to the X or Y axis).

Nope.  Decals are drawn using the same orientation as the brush face.  If you flip the horizontal or flip the vertical alignment of the texture when creating the map, the decals will also get flipped.  That's why you spray logos are sometimes backwards or upside down when you spray them on some walls.  The mapper flipped that texture horizontally or vertically when creating the map.

The only thing you can do is spray it on a different wall.
