I added my favorite monster ..The Big Blue Gargantua.. to monster_mm :)

And made plugin compile with BCC 5.5

Only problem with garg was glowing eye sprite .. didn't get it attached to monster so I disabled it

heh .. I have already added Ichthyosaur .. next one in the list is Big Momma :)

Some problems too .. Ichthyosaur mainly detects enemy by hearing .. how I could make it see things?

Make it call the Look() function then the BestVisibleEnemy() function.

I couldn't get Big Momma to make an appearance. :(
Evidently she needs a special info_BigMomma command to go with it, but I have no idea how to set it up.

BTW, Hullu, how can I get a copy of your spawn and chat protection plugin? When I clicked on the download link on your page I got, " The page cannot be found."

hullu, is the gargantua just like the one in HL in that you NEED to use explosives to kill it? i think i'll add one to my all my maps to fight the apache (EVERY MAP on my server has at LEAST 1 apache lol, badlands has 2 :D)

hullu and botman, you guys are the best. all of the HL community loves you :)

i would greatly appreciate new monsters. Botman, how about overlooking the monsters from hullu. And afterwards, publishing a new version?
