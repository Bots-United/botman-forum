From the Readme:

Enabling or disabling monster spawning:

You can use the server CVAR "monster_spawn" to enable or disable the spawning of monsters in a level.  The CVAR "monster_spawn" is set to 1 (to enable monster spawning) by default.  You can change the "monster_spawn" CVAR to 0 disable monster spawning and monsters will stop respawning.  This will not remove any existing monsters that have already spawned into the level.  You can display the current value of the CVAR by entering "monster_spawn" (without quotes) on the console.

I'd assume its a server console command, you wouldn't want your non-admin players controling your monsters :)

Yes, it's a server console command.  If you are running the server, you can type that command in on the server console.

If you are not on the server, you will need to use "rcon" to issue that command.
