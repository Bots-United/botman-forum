I've been asked about this, and have wondered myself, how one can go about bringing the weapons/classes from the para maps to the regular DoD maps.  I have heard of this existing, but have not found a guide or post about doing it anywhere.  Since Stripper2 enables the server to load entities on maps that normally contain them, I figured this might be the best place to look.

Thanks,

The MOD code may not allow those Para entities to work in normal DoD maps.

Before trying it with Stipper2, try adding them using Worldcraft first.  Create a small map (just a square room) with the entities you want to test and compile the .bsp file from within Worldcraft.  I'm sure you can find the .fgd file needed by Worldcraft for DoD on the DoD website.  See some mapping tutorial sites if you don't know how to use Worldcraft to create a simple box room.

I have the stripper2 plugin and it works great on dod.  The only problem I am having is now on mapchange some of the players are locking up and having to ctrl alt del hl and restart it.  It doesn't happen every map or with every player.
I am using AM v 25026a and the newest metamod-downloaded and updated a few days ago.
Goku I know you run this have you had any problems?
Thanks

I've managed to spawn a RPG from Half-Life into a map for DOD along with ammo for it. The thing is, I can't get the RPG to come out for me to use it. Like it's not in the inventory. Wondering if anybody would know why this would be? Also, why is it even in the dod.dll if you can't use it!?!?

It was probably added in the alpha or beta test version and never really supported in the release version of the MOD.  It's very common to have entities contained in a MOD that were only put in for testing purposes and not properly removed later.

I'm wondering if there's a way to simply be able to select the rpg after it's picked up in DOD. Cause I am able to pick it up and not select it to use it. So, I am guessing in all mods, they only allow you to handle the certain weapons made for the game.
