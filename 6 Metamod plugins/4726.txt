I took it from my 2fort stripper2 files & converted it so i could import it into a map.

This is what i have:

{
"classname" "multi_manager"
"targetname" "enable_weapons"
"origin" "0 0 0"
"sniperrifle" "0"
}
{
"classname" "trigger_hurt"
"spawnflags" "2"
"team_no" "2"
"dmg" "0"
"targetname" "sniperrifle"
"origin" "0 0 0"
}
{
"classname" "tf_weapon_sniperrifle"
"angles" "0 0 0"
"team_no" "2"
"origin" "5 1861 -1457"
"bbox_min" "-5 -5 -30"
"bbox_max" "5 5 30"
}
{
"classname" "env_sprite"
"angles" "50 120 0"
"mdl" "models/p_sniper.mdl"
"origin" "5 1861 -1457"
}
{
"classname" "trigger_hurt"
"spawnflags" "2"
"team_no" "1"
"dmg" "0"
"targetname" "sniperrifle"
"origin" "0 0 0"
}
{
"classname" "tf_weapon_sniperrifle"
"angles" "0 0 0"
"origin" "240 840 -1631"
"bbox_min" "-5 -5 -30"
"bbox_max" "5 5 30"
}
{
"classname" "env_sprite"
"angles" "50 120 0"
"team_no" "1"
"mdl" "models/p_sniper.mdl"
"origin" "240 840 -1631"
}

I see the sniper rifles, but i don't get one.

If you are using ripent to merge this into a map, be aware that ripent doesn't support the "bbox_min", "bbox_max" keys.  I made those up so that Stripper2 code could dynamically change the bounding box size around added entities.

The default bounding box size for entities is 2x2x2 (a very small box at the center of the entity).

Perhaps the rifle was being added, but you weren't getting close enough to the tiny bounding box to touch it.  Did you move around all over the weapon trying to touch it?

I use ripent.exe to add weapons to maps in counter strike and it works fine.

Here is an example of adding in a M4 rifle.
{
"origin" "159 -1519 105"
"classname" "armoury_entity"
"item" "6"
"count" "1"
}


The item number coms from the ..\cstrike\halflife-cs.fgd file.

Here is a portion of that file that shows other weapon numbers:
0: "weapon_mp5"
1: "weapon_tmp"
2: "weapon_p90"
3: "weapon_mac10"
4: "weapon_ak47"
5: "weapon_sg552"
6: "weapon_m4a1"
7: "weapon_aug"
8: "weapon_scout"
9: "weapon_g3sg1"
10: "weapon_awp"
11: "weapon_m3"
12: "weapon_xm1014"
13: "weapon_m249"
14: "weapon_flashbang"
15: "weapon_hegrenade"
16: "item_kevlar"
17: "item_assaultsuit"
18: "weapon_smokegrenade"

Hope this helps.

Oh, bbox_min/max is just for stripper2 code.. Oops.. hehe.. ok..

Yah, i moved all around the sniper rifles & jumped & crouched.. Well it dosen't seem to work for Team 2, but after i made this post & went offline & tried agian, The blue team can take "both" sniper rifles.

Thx AustinBotServer!!
I've never modified CS before.
I gotta check that out with POXbot.. :)

ps, just on a side note, HPB & FoxBot are too funny when useing weapons outa class.. I can't seem to get the "tf_weapon_ic" working. It shows the cannon, but you can't pick it up. Maybe it's the bbox.. Or it's in a wierd spot?
