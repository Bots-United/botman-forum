Hi, trying to get monster plugin working on Linux + HL1109c + Firearms 2.6 + MM v1.12.2

Metamod and the monster plugin load ok.

Auto-restarting the server on crash

But.. I can't seem to get any monsters to spawn on the map.. cfg file
is set up as suggested..

its also in the right place and named correctly..

minkey:/home/hlds_l/firearms/maps# ls -l ps_marie*

}

{

}


Also, using the 2forts sample file, the monsters fail to appear. I guess there is  a problem with the newer meta mod?

Turn on logging.  See the e-mail I sent you.

Add "monster_log 1" to your metaexec.cfg file.

Turn on logging for the server by adding "+log on" on the command line or adding "log on" in the server.cfg or autoexec.cfg file.

Start the server, then look at the most recent log file in the MOD's logs directory and search for "[MONSTER]" error messages.

If you are transfering .cfg files from a Win32 machine to a Linux machine use FTP in ASCII mode to transfer the files properly and get rid of the linefeed character at the end of the "monster" line (which you can't see with many Linux text editors).
