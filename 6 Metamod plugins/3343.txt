Are you running a dedicated server or listenserver?

If dedicated, after it is running your map,try typing "changelevel mapname" (without the quotes).

if listenserver, type the same in your console after it starts. 

I have found that sometimes when creating a monster not using monstermaker, I need to restart the map the first time.
