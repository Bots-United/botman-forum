Knowing this is early BETA, these are purely for informational purposes.  Hope they help track down any problems.

I've had the server crash 4 times in 2 different functions.  

If you want full details they're here
http://brewpub.dyndns.org:8000/monster_bts.zip

I can also provide logfiles (but they don't have much information).

Here are backtrace snippets:

Are these one's that you built or the public release version?  I have debug stuff built into the public release version that should show the lines numbers of the crash.

If you are compiling it yourself, add "-g" to the compile and link line of the Makefile.

Usually this is a bad pointer where a monster tries to damage some other entity that it thinks is a monster but it isn't.  It's probably trying to convert the entity pointer to a CMBaseMonster class and call one of the member functions (leading to the crash since there ain't no member function on entities that ain't monsters).

I built it - will add "-g".  Thanks :)

Here's one with "-g".  Looks like you already know what the issue is, but if this helps then that's great :)

UTIL_TakeDamage is used to damage a player.  It looks like this was a grenade doing the damage (since it came from CMGrenade::Explode).  Perhaps the pevInflictor (the grenade) or the pevAttacker (the monster the threw the grenade) is no longer valid.  I'm not sure what your util.cpp line number 1759 has, but the default monster util.cpp line number 1759 is the closing brace here...
code:
      if ( pEdict->v.health <= 0 )
      {
            pEdict->v.health = 1;  // can't suicide if already dead!
//            CLIENT_COMMAND(pEdict, "kill\n");
      gpGamedllFuncs->dllapi_table->pfnClientKill(pEdict);
      }

...The closing brace obviously can't cause a crash.

You'll have to post what your line 1759 has (and a few lines above and below it).

Line numbers added for clarity

code:

   1751
   1752     // do the damage
   1753     pEdict->v.health -= flTake;
   1754
   1755     if ( pEdict->v.health <= 0 )
   1756     {
   1757         pEdict->v.health = 1;  // can't suicide if already dead!
   1758 //      CLIENT_COMMAND(pEdict, "kill\n");
   1759       gpGamedllFuncs->dllapi_table->pfnClientKill(pEdict);
   1760     }
   1761



I had a couple other crashes yesterday at the same line, but with different weapons.

I also had it crash at weapons.cpp:78:

code:

     76
     77     if (UTIL_IsPlayer(gMultiDamage.pEntity))
     78         UTIL_TakeDamage(gMultiDamage.pEntity, pevInflictor, pevAttacker,
 gMultiDamage.amount, gMultiDamage.type );
     79     else if (gMultiDamage.pEntity->v.euser4 != NULL)
     80     {
     81         CMBaseMonster *pMonster = GetClassPtr((CMBaseMonster *)VARS(gMul
tiDamage.pEntity));
     82         pMonster->TakeDamage(pevInflictor, pevAttacker, gMultiDamage.amo
unt, gMultiDamage.type );
     83     }



Here's another set of backtraces if you're interested:

http://brewpub.dyndns.org:8000/monster_bts2.tar.gz

I can certainly go back to the default monster that you've shipped, if you'd like me to.

Thanks again for a great plugin!

If this is causing you to crash...
code:
gpGamedllFuncs->dllapi_table

...then the metamod game DLL api table isn't being initialized properly (or is being overwritten later by an array going out of bounds or some other bad memory accesses).

The gpGamedllFuncs table should be set up in the monster_api.cpp code when metamod loads the plugin DLL.  Assuming that you didn't modify that stuff then you probably have something trashing memory and overwriting that table.
