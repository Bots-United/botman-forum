Duke had posted sample code he was using for tfc. I copied some of it but would like to add grenades to it instead of taking them away. Can you give me some input on what I am over looking?  Here is the code I have so far.
weapon_handgrenade

// Add a few ammo packs at different points every map play

// First set..
{
     {
           PRECACHE_MODEL(models/grenpack.mdl)      // go on and precache the model even tho i dont think its needed
           origin/1018 2408 -204            // location of the pack on the map using, X Y Z
           angles/0 0 0                  // the way the pack is facing
           renderamt/64                  // (?) brightness of the pack
           rendercolor/127 255 127            // (?) render color (does not seem to afftect it)
           message/#cz_restock            // gives you the message, Restocking Grenades
           grenades_2/4                  // gives you max +gren2 grenades
           grenades_1/4                  // gives you max +gren1 grenades
           ammo_medikit/20                  // (?) not sure.. but needed for the pack to work

that

[strip]
weapon_handgrenade

has nothin to do with the ammo packs..
on the map crossfire.. there are grenades on the ground in some places that u can pick up..
and if u run all your weapons out of ammo.. u switch to the grenade (and use it just like in HLDM) but there is no ammo.. so u get endless of them.. i just wanted it to take out these grenades because they are for HLDM and not TFC..  like i said they have nothin to do with the ammo packs.. the code

grenades_2/4 // gives you max +gren2 grenades
grenades_1/4 // gives you max +gren1 grenades

in the backpack code is what gives u grenades..
and the way its set in my example.. u get FULL grenades when u pick the pack up.... there are not taken away

if your talkin about adding more of these "weapon handgrenade" take the [strip] part out of the code.. so it wont "strip" them and u can just take apart the crossfire map with botmans bsp tools and look for "weapon_handgrenade" in the text file u make..and copy it and change the origin points to were you want more of them to spawn
