In using monster as a form of punishment (admin command) I'd like to customize the monsters we use for that purpose. I have some re-skinned squeak and headcrab models I want to use. Is it best to create alternate source code (ie squeakgrenade2.cpp) or can I simply change the files being precached in the existing code. If I just modify your existing .cpp will clients use my custom model (named something different like bob.mdl for example)? And if they have downloads set to off (client side) will they revert to the existing snark or will they see NO model?

You can't revert one model to another one (the only case that I'm aware of is the player model defaulting to Gordon.mdl if the desired model doesn't exist, but I believe this "swapping" is actually handled in the client DLL code (which you couldn't change).

You should be able to modify the Monster source code and specify a different model to use (headcrab2.mdl instead of headcrab.mdl, for example) and since the headcrab2.mdl file will be precached (is HAS to for the server to even run), the client will download that model if they don't already have it (unless client downloads are disabled in which case they won't see anything, but it should still attack them).

Don't make the mistake of trying to replace an old Half-Life model with a new replacement (i.e. you create headcrab2.mdl, rename it headcrab.mdl and put it in the 'models' folder to replace the one in the .pak file.  This will work fine on your machine (example, single player), but can cause problems on other people's machines, where they're always stuck with your version of a model that they might not want being used on other servers or when they play single player (in the case of stuff going into the 'valve\models' folder.

Be aware the most MODs use models from the valve\models or valve\pak0.pak file, so replacing things in valve\models may screw up more than Half-Life single player and Half-Life deathmatch.  It could effect Counter-Strike, TFC, DoD, and other MODs.

Your best bet is to create another version of an existing model (using the same animations and animation sequence), name it slightly different from the default one and place it in the MODs 'models' folder, then modify the code to precache and use that .mdl file instead of the default one.
