You might want to post your question to no one in particular.  I'm getting sick of responding to LWC-only questions.  First of all, you need an entity type, this should be a Info_tfgoal (for TFC).  Try this:

{
"classname" "item_tfgoal"   
"angles" "0 90 0"
"goal_result" "0"
"owned_by" "1" //blue
"goal_activation" "512" //what you gave
"g_e" "1"
"g_a" "1"
"goal_state" "2"
"message" "#cz_restock"
"ammo_medikit" "20"
"noise" "weapons/scock1.wav"
"team_no" "1"
"no_grenades_1" "2"
"no_grenades_2" "2"
"ammo_nails" "50"
"ammo_rockets" "20"
"ammo_cells" "50"
"ammo_shells" "50"
"wait" "30"  //time for mdl to return
"mdl" "models/backpack.mdl"
"noise" "weapons/scock1.wav"
"origin" "-299 225 -143"  //replace w yours
}

The daedalus readme says that it's a plugin for CS which may explain why you couldn't get it to work in TFC.  Have you had any luck with using any aspect of the plugin on TFC?

model diddnt glow... im about to give up on it, just wont work..  if i were to shine a light on it, can you change the color of the lite? if so, could you show me an example, and what colors are available? 

{
classname/env_glow
renderfx/14
rendermode/3
renderamt/150
rendercolor/117 203 255
model/sprites/flare1.spr
origin/0 -352 -1400
}

i think this is what i need to use, but if so, how could i make it glow red/ blue?

Opps, shoud be an item_tfgoal and not an info_tfgoal.  This will work.  If it doesn't please post the entity values you've tried.
