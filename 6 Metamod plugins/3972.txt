i want to make an ALMOST invisible model to block a guy using the turret. i'm thinkin on usin a func_breakable but how can i make the models almost invisible using render? does render make it MORE visible or LESS visible?

Not all entities can be rendered transparently.

I know that "func_illusionary" can be rendered semi-transparently and I'm sure that other entities can as well, but I'm not an experienced mapper and don't know a lot about which entities support the different render effects.

Take a look at some Half-Life mapping tutorial websites and see if you can find some tutorials that talk about the different rendering effects for entities.  It should list which entities can be rendered using those effects.

Also, look through the .fgd file for the MOD that you are using to see which render effects they support.

P.S. "renderamt" is the actual key used in entities to control how transparent it is.  In the Half-Life .fgd file, this is found in the "RenderFields" class.  Any entity that inherits from this class should support the "renderamt" key value.

For TFC every entity that effects a solid can be render transparent. As can many env_* entities.

an info_tfgoal cannot be rendered (which is what most TFC models are). I'm trying to think of what else can call a .mdl file but I can't think of anything that would render it solid.

Unless you mean you're creating a func_wall

But if you're trying to stop someone from using the turret, strip it out. I assume you mean a gun like from tiger and totalwar.

[strip]
func_tank

Should remove it completely.

You may also want to try a trigger_push which would psuh the player away from the turret.
