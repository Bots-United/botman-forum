Are you talking about creating a single player map and changing the monster settings or are you talking about changing the code?

If you are talking about creating a map, see the VERC website which has a nice entities list for Half-Life and gives all of the Worldcraft key/value settings for monsters...

...for example, Barney can be set with the TriggerCondition "See Player, Mad at Player" to get Barney to shoot at players...

If you want to change which monsters are friendly to which other monsters, you need to change the source code and rebuild the game DLL file.  See the CBaseMonster::IRelationship() to determine which types of monsters are friends/enemies to other types of monsters.  The relationship values (like R_NO, R_DL, etc.) are listed in the monsters.h file.  The Classify() function for each monster will return the class (or type) of monster that it is, which will return things like CLASS_ALIEN_MONSTER, CLASS_HUMAN_MILITARY, CLASS_ALIEN_PREY, etc.

Change either the value returned by the Classify() function (to change one monster) or change the IRelationship code (to modify the way a whole group of monsters behave).

Dooooh!  I misread your question.

I thought you were asking about how to change the monster behavior in Half-Life single player (not Sven-Coop).

I don't know nuthin' about Sven-Coop.  You'd have to ask the guys at the Sven-Coop website about how to change their monsters behavior.

I doubt this can be easily done through a metamod plugin since the code that determines what monsters attack and don't attack is only in the game DLL code (at least for the Half-Life single player SDK code it is).  This behavior isn't available to external code (like hook DLLs or to the engine).  The only way to change the behavior would be to create your own monsters like I did for the Monster plugin for metamod.  The Monster plugin would be a good place to start if you can't get any information from the Sven-Coop guys.

you could open up the maps you want and edit the spawntimes there and then recompile it.. you can use ripent to do that.. i will not change the map as far as the clients are concerned..  so basically, you can edit the map and the clients wont need to dl the new map...  ripent and stripper are alot alike, and its easy, i change my tfc maps all the time.. add new stuff, take stuff out..  sweet..
