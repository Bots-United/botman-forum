To make Ichthyosaur fade after death, did you change the code in the hl.dll or in botman's monster plugin? I'm using Stripper2 with DM but would like to mod the dll to make Ichthyosaur fade out also.

Is it the same area? What should I look for?

Thanks,

Yes, I've done a few things...just wanted to be sure it was in the SDK and not the plugin.

Thanks

I added your code and it works great...thanks.

BTW, it would not compile with the folloowing line of code so I comented it out to try and it works fine without it.

SetThink ( &CMBaseMonster::SUB_Remove );

Commenting that out will cause the monster to not get removed from the level.  You will eventually run out of edicts and the game will crash if they aren't removed properly.  Try...
code:
SetThink( SUB_Remove );

...instead.

That works better...I had started to notice that while icky disappeared, he wasn't really gone.
