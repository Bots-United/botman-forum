Ok i have to working trigger_pushs, that push a player upwards using 0 -1 0 as the angles. I now an trying to create two more at a dif location that project a player not up or down, but sideways, along the y axis. Ive tried many combos of the angles to see what format i need to ajust it, but i cant get it to NOT make it push along the X axis. How would you do it, someone please give me the angle key/value.

Search some Half-Life mapping forums (like VERC or Wavelength) for "trigger_push".

I've seen mappers ask questions about trying to get trigger_push to push in diagnals and apparently you can't do that with standard Half-Life deatchmatch code (I think Spirit of Half-Life allows this).

You'll probably get better responses on a mapper's forum than here anyway.

I forgot to mention, also check the 'trigger_push' entity description for it's details...

You'll notices the angles key is [Y Z X] and not [X Y Z] like you would expect.  The angles format is in Worldcraft directions where the Y axis is upwards.

Also, when you figure it out come back and tell us how to do it!  ;)
