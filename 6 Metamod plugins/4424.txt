I had a stripper cfg that I was using in DoD b3.1 to add a new flag to a map and now in DoD v1.0 part of it doesn't work.  The .bsp is the same one from before.  I looked at the new fgd and the ents of new maps and could find no change to the entity (dod_capture_area) that I'm having problems with.  The entity in question is normally tied to a model#, but I was creating a new one using bbox_min and bbox_max.  As I said, this used to work perfectly, but now it seems that the bounding box has changed.  It's like it either moved away from its origin or shrunk down to 1% of its original size.  I don't know how else to explain it.  Below is the config.  It seems the orientation of the flag also changed, but I just chalked that up to the flag model being redone.  Any ideas why the bounding box isn't working right anymore?

Did you try e-mailing the DoD team (or coder) to find out what had changed?

Unfortunately I don't think they would have any idea what I'm talking about, and that's if they even replied.  I've tried to ask them technical questions before and either I don't get a response or they don't know the answer.  Besides which, I don't think they will really care to answer since this effects them in no way whatsoever.  I figured I'd stand a better chance of figuring out the problem if I asked here.

I don't suppose you'd have any suggestions on what to check or look at that might help?

If they don't know the answer, then you aren't contacting the correct people.

Don't e-mail the web page contact, they won't know.  If the DoD web page lists the team members, contact the "coder" to get answers to techinical questions.  If the website doesn't list the team members (or doesn't give their job descriptions), send an e-mail to the main contact e-mail address on their website and ask them "What is the e-mail address of the coder for this MOD?", then send your question directly to that person.

The coder was the person I contacted.  Like I said, either they don't know, they don't care, or they can't be bothered to reply.

And I still have no idea what the problem is, but it appears that it is not an entity problem.  Bounding box (bbox min/bbox max) does not work at all in DoD anymore, regardless of the entity.  Just fyi in case anyone else is having this problem.

"It seems the orientation of the flag also changed,"...

Well an angle line has been commented out:
//   angles/0 180 25
  angles/-25 270 0

As for the bounding box aspect, I wouldn't know.

Ummm...yeah.

// = old orientation

I left it there for reference.
