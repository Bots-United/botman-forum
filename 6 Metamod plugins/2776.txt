Rather than preventing people from getting in the bunker, just remove everything from it.

Strip out the wall chargers, func_button for airstrike, strip out all the ammo and weapons, just leave the whole place completely empty.  You could strip out the func_ladders to keep people from going up into the turret gun towers.

If you still want to automatically trigger the doors, you may have to look on mapping tutorial websites at trigger and multi_manager entities to fixure out a way to keep triggering the doors to close.  The "func_button" airstrike button triggers all of the doors (front and above in the sentry gun towers) to close, so there's got to be something already in the map that closes all the doors.
