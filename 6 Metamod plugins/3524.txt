Will it work?

[strip]
[add]
{
    classname/dod_round_time
    round_time_length/180
    spawnflags/1
}


Can limit the time to 3 min?
If I want to limit,how to write?

hmm, I don't really know much about stripper or dod. But I think you can only have one entity, so you'd better just use ripent to modify the round_time entity in the map.

Since it was mentioned in this thread, what is ripent and how does it differ from BSP_tool?

Almost the same as stripper but actualy edits the bsp rather then edit what spawns and what doesn't from the outside.

I know nothing about DOD mapping :(

post reply, ripent is a small dosprogram that exports and imports a .ent file from a bsp with the entire entlist in it. That way you can "easily" make map mods :) .
get it here: http://users.pandora.be/vanbeeck/ripent.exe
how to use:
open up a dos window, type in the path of ripent, then type -import / -export (one of the two) and then the maplocation, like this:
c:\windows>f:\tools\ripent.exe -export c:\sierra\half-life\tfc\maps\2fort
this will create a file 2fort.ent in the maps folder.
edit the entfile in wordpad and then -import it


(sorry for the crappy tutorial ;) )
