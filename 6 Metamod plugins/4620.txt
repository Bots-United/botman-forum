Hi 

My autoteam sorting doesnt seem to work for reconnects, does anyone know how the reconnect procedure differ from the normal connect procedure? 

Thanks

If by "reconnect" you mean connecting after a map change, then no, there should be no difference between connecting to the server the first time and connecting after a map change.

No I mean if you disconnect and retry.

the only difference I can think of is the newly connecting player might have some leftover information from whoever was using the playerslot last, some MODs have this problem.

It might have something to do with the "receipt"
command that gets issued. I think the reconnect process is shorter and therefore my function tries to sort the player in a team before i can take effect. (before he is in the game) and therefore the teamchoice command is ignored. 
The trick must be to know when to sort players into the team.

Its probably safe to sort a player into a team after ClientPutInServer() is called for that player.
