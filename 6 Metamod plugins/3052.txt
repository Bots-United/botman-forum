Is it possible to replace a specific entity, say by targetname?

In one map, I stripped all multi managers, then added them back in and modified one. A specific way to change a single one would be handier.

You can strip out a single entity by using the origin of that entity (if it has one).  See the ReadMe.txt file about putting an origin after the entity name in the [strip] section.

If the entity does not have an origin then there is no way to strip out just that one entity.  You can use the BSP tools to dump the entities to see which of them contain origins and what the origin is.

Oops. How did that section get in the readme? Just what I was looking for, thanks.
