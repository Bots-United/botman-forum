Could someone help me on makeing a spotlight type of thing. Sometype of thing that shine's a beam of light on the grond from a angle, If you dont understand then take a look at rock2 on the sniper tower's those spotlight thing's. Could someone give me the concept or bassis or something on how it's made or even post a snippet of the code.

isn't that done with mapping instead of coding?

Have you checked the entites used in rock2 to create the spotlights on that map?  I'm not sure but it looks like it might be a light_spot entity. 

Look here for light_spot information:  http://www.valve-erc.com/entities/?entity=light_spot

I'm working on a mapping tutorial showing how to do this, I'll try and finish it tonight then convert it to stripper style.

Lunatic With Candy, have you finished the tutorial, and if so, are you going to post it? ;D

Oh lol, forgot about it :).

I told Kris how to do it on AIM, but he said it didn't work. I know it works as I compiled and saw that it works :). So he either did it wrong, or it can't be done without forcing people to dl a new version of the map :-\

I'd try it myself, but I don't have the time.

{
"classname" "light_spot"
"target" "centerspot"
"angles" "0 0 0"
"_cone" "30"
"_cone2" "45"
"pitch" "-90"
"_light" "255 0 0 200"
"style" "2"
"origin" "256 256 256"
}
{
"classname" "light_spot"
"target" "centerspot"
"angles" "0 0 0"
"_cone" "30"
"_cone2" "45"
"pitch" "-90"
"_light" "255 255 128 200"
"origin" "256 -256 256"
}
{
"classname" "info_target"
"targetname" "centerspot"
"origin" "0 0 128"
}

One light is red and flashes, the other is normal.

What bsp is this for, so I can give a try?  Also, where is the info_target on the playing area so I don't have to run around trying to find it.  Thanks

This isn't a map. This is a plane map with nothing but 4 walls, ground and a skybox. I was just testing to see if my system worked.

The target is 10ft above the dead center of the map (0,0,128 - 1px = 1.33 inch give or take). The two lights 20ft off the ground, and 20ft from the target and 40 ft from each other.

So basicly its the center of the 2fort bridge with the lights on the battlements.

Covert that to stripper (erase single " and replace double "" with /). Then find your own damn coordinates :D
