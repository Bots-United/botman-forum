Do you have metamod working properly without Stripper2 being loaded?  That's the first step.  See the ReadMe.txt file that comes with Stripper2 for details on getting metamod installed.

Also, if you are using a newer version of metamod, the installation will be different.  Newer versions of metamod place plugins in a different directory than the instructions in the ReadMe.txt file with Stripper2.

See this thread...

although there is a new version of metamod (that whole new system), the installation of stripper is pretty easy
<moddir> means the mod name, like cs or tfc
-move stripper2_mm.dll to <moddir>/dlls folder
-open <moddir>/addons/metamod/plugin.ini and add the lines:
win32 dlls/stripper2_mm.dll
linux dlls/stripper2_mm_i386.so
-move stripper2.cfg to <moddir>

all done :)

The newer version of metamod expects plugin .dll files to be located in the MOD's "addons" folder (which is only used by metamod).

The older versions of metamod expected the .dll file to be located in the MOD's "dlls" folder (which is the way the Stripper2 ReadMe.txt file describes).

You can either move the Stripper2 .dll file into the "addons" folder and use the example metamod plugin.ini file, or place the Stripper2 .dll file into the MOD's "dlls" folder (the way the Stripper2 ReadMe.txt file describes) and modify the metamod plugin.ini file to load it from that directory (as described above by Shawn).

In either case, the directory where you put the .dll file and the pathname specified in the plugin.ini file must match.
