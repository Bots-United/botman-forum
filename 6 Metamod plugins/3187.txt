The monsters are cool, I enjoy blowing them up in 2fort!

Anyway, I was wondering if you could maybe add in a few of theses features. But I know you probably don't want to do some of theses and/or have the time. But still :)

1. Monster waypoints
2. Monsters have more health
3. Monsters can be on teams (what I mean by this is say they won't attack the red team or the blue team etc...)
4. Scientist follow you
5. Gman (good target :)

Cya later

Yes, is there a way to increase the monsters' health?  Currently it doesn't take much to kill one.  Which reminds me of a scene from 'Night of the Living Dead,' where the sheriff says of the living dead: "Beat um or burn um, they go up pretty easy." ;)

There is a way to increase the health and attack the monsters have typically using the skill.cfg file. I haven't installed Botman's plugin yet to see if the skill.cfg file affects it but I would guess it does.

I have only played with the ichthyosaur (large fish) but here is what I did:

Original configuration (commented out)

// sk_ichthyosaur_health1      "200"
// sk_ichthyosaur_health2      "200"
// sk_ichthyosaur_health3      "400"
// sk_ichthyosaur_shake1 "20"
// sk_ichthyosaur_shake2 "35"
// sk_ichthyosaur_shake3 "50"

New configuration

sk_ichthyosaur_health1      "400"
sk_ichthyosaur_health2      "400"
sk_ichthyosaur_health3      "400"

sk_ichthyosaur_shake1 "50"
sk_ichthyosaur_shake2 "70"
sk_ichthyosaur_shake3 "90"

I found this to work much better when I placed him in Undertow in the water beneath the waterfall. He would last longer before dying and cause more player damage.

Right now the skill.cfg values are hard coded in the Monster plugin.  At some point I will make the monster health and damage configurable but right now they use the "skill level 2" settings (same as Normal game in single player).

i think here is the right thread for what i already asked in the valve list :)

- waypoints as discribed above, but i think it would be enough if you have to points where the monsters walk between them (eg. straight line between 2 points)

- switching the plugin on/off via admin_monsters 0/1

- admin_monsterspawn command to spawn a monster somewhere on the map for later adding while playing (perhaps even testing some positions)

- disabling monster spawn points or resetting the values

- is there a way to get the right angle for the monsters? the bspview tool is great, but it doesn't show the angle you are facing.

well i guess thats it for now. i think its enough for you at the moment ;) 
oh.. right one thin - Great Plugin !

Targets for monsters, and path_corner support maybe.  That is most likely asking too much though.  Maybe bot reactions to monsters?  What else.  Hmm.  Info_node support would be hard wouldn't it?  I'm not too big on those aspects of programming.  Anyway, great tool botman, keep it up!

Timo -

1. I think Stripper2 can be used to add monster info_nodes to the maps.  I didn't remove any of this code from the monster AI, so if there are info_nodes in the maps then the monsters should follow them.  Of course, normally only single player maps have these info_nodes.  See some of the Half-Life mapping sites for information on adding info_nodes for monsters to follow.

2. I can look at adding some server cvars to enable/disable the monster spawning on the fly.  That shouldn't be too hard to do.

3. My debugging version of the monster code has a client command that will spawn a monster directly in front of the player that issues the command.  I disabled this in the release version because I didn't want players to be able to abuse this in game by spawning hundreds of monsters at one time.  Perhaps I can modify this so that players can manually spawn just a few monsters at a time (maybe 1 per minute or something like that) and re-enable this feature where it can't be abused.  This feature could be disabled by the admin via a server cvar.

4. I think it would be a little clumbersome enabling/disabling specific monster spawn points on the fly while in the game.  You would somehow have to keep track of specific spawn point numbers and toggle them on or off using that index (or, God forbid, using the origin itself).  I don't see this as something that would be used very much and probably isn't worth the time to implement it.

5. See the thread I created called "Finding the correct angle for spawn points" in this section of the forum.

Again, I haven't removed any of this code from the monster navigation code, so if it works in single player, you should be able to use Stripper2 to add these entities to a multiplayer map whereever you want them.

I do plan to modify the HPB bot code so that they will recognize monsters and attack them.

botman,

Could you make it configurable on whether the HPB bot would recognize and attack monsters? I actually kind of like it that the bots ignore the monsters but the monsters do not ignore the bots.

@botman

thnx - i will take a look at point 1 and 5 :)

4. was only a suggestion. i too think it is not very easy to accomplish such a thing. it is better to have an admin command to stop or start the monster spawning (point 2). the information about enabled/disabled could be kept in the vault.ini so it is set even after a mapchange.

3. it doesn't have to be a public command - admin command would be sufficient. but the aspect of a public trigger is cool - snarks falling in front of their feet :)
i dont know if you know the timebomb plugin for adminmod. there you can disable and enable the public say command (kamikaze) and admins can timebomb somebody (nice for campers) via command. the public command can be used only once in 3 minutes (can be set in the plugin) also there is a protection agains several players becoming a timebomb at the same time.
