Is there a way to make all the txt that bsp_tool creates go into a txt file? or is there a way to be able to view all the stuff.. it goes so long that i only can view the last 30 or so.

Yes...

bsp_tool.exe <arguments here> >output.txt

...will redirect the output to a file called "output.txt" (obviously the "<arguments here>" gets substituted with the arguments you want and you don't include the '<' and '>' around the arguments, but you do include the '>' before the output filename).
