Many entities allow you to specify the model it will use.  Most entities have the model hard coded into the DLL (you can only change it by modifying the source code and rebuilding the DLL).  The only way you can create a vehicle that you can drive around would be if you created a brand new entity and created the code for it.  Half-Life deathmatch (and almost all MODs) don't have real vehicles that the players can drive while in multiplayer games.

In general, you can ONLY spawn something that already exists.  You can't pick something at random, say for example a tank turret that you can jump in a turn and fire at people with, and expect to be able to spawn that in a MOD.  This requires code.  Any item that you are going to spawn that doesn't already exist, won't do anything even if you want an entity with that model.

You also can't just change the behavior of something.  You can't make grenades explode with lava blasts.  You can't make tripmines shoot off of the wall and take off someone's head instead of exploding.  You can't make a shotgun shoot snarks instead of shotgun shells.  All of these would require changes to the code (which Stripper2 does not do).

You should take a look at various Half-Life mapping tutorial websites.  They should you all of the things that you can spawn in the game.  If the mapping tutorial sites don't show something, then chances are you can't spawn that type of thing (at least not so it will do anything anyway).

Apophis you need a new engine... try a new game maybe, one that's engine limits aren't already stressed beyond reason.
