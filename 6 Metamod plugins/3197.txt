i know this metamod is intended for all mods... but i have a few suggestions for improvement in Counter Strike specifically...

- Monsters are much too easy to kill in counter strike... One shot from a pistol is often enough to kill an enemy... and just a few shots on the apache will also destroy it... i don't know about other mods as i haven't tried it in them. Perhaps a variable to specify the health monsters start out with?

- When you shoot at the enemies it doesn't create any blood. They just die, also if you kill them with the knife it makes a sound as if you are hitting a wall not flesh. I noticed that if you hit drivable vehicle in CS with the knife it makes the sound of hitting flesh (maybe this will help to get it right).

- It would nice to be able to make monsters spawn at the start of rounds or a certain amount of time after rounds (sepecified by a variable in the .cfg). I was thinking of spawning say an apache at the Terrorist base and CT base 30 seconds after the round starts, this would stop people from base camping in an original way :)

I know this is the very first beta, and its already great work well done. Don't mean to whine about it, just a few suggestions for future version :).

I'm not going to be making any MOD specific enhancements to the monster plugin unless the plugin doesn't work properly with the MOD (or causes it to crash on just that one MOD).

The monster health and damage amounts will be configurable at some point and you can adjust this to whatever you like once that's done.

Attacking them with the knife or crowbar will make the sound of hitting a wall.  I can't change this as this sound comes from the MOD DLL and not the monster plugin.

ok, being able to give the monsters specific amounts of health would already be a great improvement... what about the blood though? i would have thought this is a general problem in all mods? is it similar to the crowbar/knife problem in that it can't be fixed?

The only MOD I've been testing this in so far is TFC.  Plenty of blood gets created in TFC when you hit a monster or it hits you.  I'm not sure if Counter-Strike uses a different network message for displaying blood, but I kind of doubt it.  I hardly ever play CS at all and I don't even remember if it displays blood on surfaces at all when you kill somebody.  If CS doesn't display blood on the ground when you kill someone, the plugin won't be able to do it either.

Counter-Strike shows blood (or the equivalent) if a monster is shot.

Just remember that the monster bleed YELLOW, not RED.  Maybe your video card isn't displaying the blood decals properly.  Try a different video mode (software or direct3d if you've using opengl) to see if that takes care of it.

no i don't mean blood on the floor and walls... that works just fine... i mean that when you shoot them with a gun, normally you should see small sprites of blood apear where they where shot... This happens in the original Half-Life too, take the sub-machine gun and shoot it at a monster you'll see blood sprites in the location you shot them as well as on the walls behind them....

I also noticed something odd, counter-strike allows most weapons to shoot through walls... well when you shoot a monster thru a wall you'll see blood decal apear on the wall you shot through not on the wall behind the monster... if you shoot an apache through the wall you'll see sparks on the wall you are shooting through rather than the helicopter itself... strange stuff, doesn't really bother me just thought i would mention it :)

In TFC i guess most weapons are rocket launchers and grenade launchers so you wouldn't really notice it... but try taking the Sniper and put it in automatic mode (machine gun type firing) and shoot a monster, you'll see what i mean... no blood appears at the location where you shot the monster.
