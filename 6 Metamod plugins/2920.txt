  Been trying to get the osprey to spawn in on my server in crossfire.  It will apear for a second then go away.  This is the line i am using.

{
   classname/monstermaker
   origin/-14 -895 -1491
   angle/90
   monstercount/-1    // no limit on number of snarks
   m_imaxlivechildren/-1 // no limit on number of snarks
   monstertype/monster_osprey
   auto_start/1
   delay/50 // 5 seconds apart
}
Thanks for any help

I don't think monster_osprey is allowed in multiplayer games (only single player games).

The entity will spawn, then set a Think time (probably 0.1 seconds), then it will check to see if this is a single player or multiplayer game.  If it's multiplayer, the monster will automatically remove itself.  I know that the houndeye, and headcrab both do this (you can't spawn them either).

{ 
classname/monstermaker 
angles/0 90 0 
origin/-270 -860 -1500 
renderfx/11 
rendercolor/0 240 0 
goal_activation/0 
monstertype/monster_osprey 
} 

That is what I use and it works. However, I havent spawned anyone there but you can try.

I use it for Crossfire (Death Match)

Good luck

When I had the delay set it would appear and
then disappear. Once, I took that out it worked
fine.

The osprey can be spawned in TFC, check the map renagade. It's a hunted style map where the prez has to teleport out. If a boddyguard uses the teleporter (s)he is teleported to an osprey and then falls to his/er death.

The osprey MODEL can be used, but the TFC DLL doesn't have a monster_osprey entity so you can't have the osprey flying around and shooting at people on the ground.

You could probably make a func_train or something similar if you wanted the osprey model to move around, but it still won't shoot at anybody.
