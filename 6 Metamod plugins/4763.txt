I want to try and make a tag metamod plugin. It will be quite simple. Someone is "it" and they glow a color and are notified about it. Then they have to +use on a different player to tag them.

How would I determine when a player +uses a different player?

Check to see if the IN_USE bit is set in the players 'flags' field in the edict_s structure.
