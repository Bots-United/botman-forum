Hi

I want to intercept and prevent suicides as they screw up my round/score counting. im guessing that I could intercept the kill message and throw it away,but I dont know witch one it is as the message type is an int. Does anyone know where these messagecodes are defined, or if there is some better/simpler way of preventing players to committed suicide? 

Tnanks.

I would think in most MODs, the player index of the killer and the player index of the victim would indicate who suicided.

It might be something like (killer==victim, I killed myself), or (killer==-1, nobody killed me), etc.  Examine the killer and victim index when you suicide yourself.

Look at the ClientKill function.
