Is it possible to set a trigger like a button or walking through a section that will trigger a monstermaker class? Rather than have the monster spawn once when the map starts i would like it to spawn when a player does something...

BTW, I've been using Stripper2 for only a week (in the evenings) and the players coming in while I am making changes have loved the options to the maps...thanks

Yes, the Half-Life deathmatch snark_pit map has a button that triggers the monster maker in it.

Download and install my BSP tools utilities and you can dump the entities in the snark_pit map to see how Valve did the button triggering the monster maker.  See the ReadMe.txt file included in the Stripper2 download to learn how to use the BSP tool to dump the entities.
