botman , the really weird stuff is a question for you. i have added some things into the map well.bsp in TFC. everything works fine, but i noticed 2 of my backpacks in the attic are turned around, and the same on the other team,but i haven't even messed with them. I also noticed the date on my well.bsp has changed to a recent date.I didn't change anything in the  BSP file.so i took out the   STR file for that map, and they are still turned around.
 2nd:  anyone know what the code is to strip out all backpacks in the map? All i have done is added, i have never stripped anything yet.
 3rd: Botman i tried to clone a brush in that map. i followed what you said here http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=6&action=display&num=2687  i got the location of the brush and i know where i want to put it. It didn't work tho. i even took a code that someone gave me (it works) and i tried moving it to another location but nothing shows up when i move it.Unless i only drop it down about 100 from where they have it in the map then it works. ??     Thanks for any help.....  cLaD

You don't specify the world coordinate where you want to spawn a cloned brush model, you specify the RELATIVE offset from it's original location.

For example, if the original brush was at location (100, 100, 100) and you wanted to place the brush at (190, 150, 0), you wouldn't specify (190, 150, 0) as the origin, you would specify (90, 50, -100) as the origin (since this is the relative offset from the original location).

are you say substract 100 from x ,100 y ,100 z  on the origin i want to place the brush ?

Also botman, any idea on the bags i'm talking about ?

You subtract the original location of the cloned brush model from where you want to spawn it to get the "origin" to use when adding it via Stripper2 (i.e. if the original location is X and you want to spawn it at Y, then Z = Y - X and "origin" = Z).

For the backpacks, it just sounds like you have the wrong "angles" key/value set (or don't have one at all).  See this thread...

with the back packs, i haven't changed anything with those, they have just turned around.
 I added a few backpacks in other locations, but none in that area.

Well, now that you've moved them, fiddle with the angles.  It seems, however, that with some info_tfgoals you can't correct the angle in which they face.  I.e., after the info_tfgoal is used once it reverts to a default angle - kinda like facing Mecca. Asalam Alaikum.

ok let me re-explain, maybe i said it wrong....hehe
 i have added backpacks to the map, and the one's i added are fine. i have not added any backpacks to the upper level of the map,and they those are the one's that have turned around since i have added backpacks in other locations on the map .

Also, i am tring to find out how to strip all backpacks in a map. So really it won't matter about the bags being turned around, but in the future i may run into the same problem i have here so i wanted to know how this could have happen and why it happen.

 i posted above that the map date changed after adding the str file to the map. So i guessing thats why the backpacks may have turned around.But why did it change it ? It's like it wrote something to the BSP file.

As of the question to stripping out all the backpacks, you got two options, one to add info_tfgoal to the strip section of the str.
Second to ad a set of XYZ after the info_tfgoal in the strip section. The XYZ should be the location of a single info_tfgoal, and should strip out only that goal. If you are adding packs that have grens, and are gonna add packs to everywhere you want them, and dont want any of the original, the just strip them all out.
Just my 2cents.

Stripper2 doesn't modify the map file.  Something else must have done this.

Have you been using ripent by any chance?  It will modify the map file.

i used ripent about a month ago, but i have reinstalled that map 3 times since then. I never could get ripent to work right for me , so i temperaly gave up on that and only mess with the stripper2 now.
