I know this comes up a lot but I've searched and searched and tested and retried for over 2 hours now with no luck... My searches found people discussing this before but it always ends in "thanks I figured it out" as opposed to "I did this *INSERT CONFIG HERE* and it worked". 

So I'll ask this question again...

How can I make a solid something in game. I have a "couch" model that I want to add to a map. Its kind of a joke thing from my game community. Anyway, I want it to be solid and not destroyable. I know that monster_generic and monster_furniture are both available for TFC but when I try them I can't even see the model, nor is it solid yet invisible its just not there.. If I use item_tfgoal or func_breakable I can see it but neither are solid (can jump it it rather than walk through it). Can someone give me an example of putting a solid, non breakable entity into TFC? I don't need this thing to DO anything. Id rather it not be pushable but could live with that. 

Please help...

If you use item_tfgoal just set the goal activation bitfield g_a to 8192

Heres a tidbit on it from tfmapped..

8192 - Is Solid
The item will be literally "solid" (not be able to be walked through) to player who do not meet the criteria of the item, and thusly cannot pick it up.
You could make it so every player fails the criteria and no one can pick it up and it would be solid.
Heres the link

do you happen to have a working example for stripper2? I tried item_tfgoal and my model disappears... And even with it gone its still non-solid (or it just doesn't spawn). No error in logs with item_tfgoal but error with Item_tfgoal in logs.

If you follow the link to the valve erc they usualy have downloadable .map files as examples, dl that open it with notepad and search for the entity - then convert that from .map format to stripper format.

this is for a model you can pickup...this one also has quad damage..you have to set the g_a property and change the team_no and owned_by and obviouslly the model and pathname...hope this helps.

item_tfgoal doesn't seem to take a model as an option and info_tfgoal doesn't allow the g_a 8192 setting. Any other ideas?

EDIT: oops didn't see last post, thanks I'll try that out...
