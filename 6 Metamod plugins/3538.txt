I am an admin for a off-site Linux server where I have ftp access. It has been requested to add Stripper2 to the server and I am wondering if I update all the appropriate files and add the Stripper2 Linux dll's will I need to have the game server restarted before it will kick in?

Thanks,

Yes, you will probably have to restart the server for these changes to take effect.  You can try just loading the Stripper2 metamod plugin using the "meta load" command (see the metamod docs for details) if you have rcon access to issue metamod commands.

The Stripper2 changes should take effect when the next map is loaded (since Stripper2 stuff only happens at map load time).
