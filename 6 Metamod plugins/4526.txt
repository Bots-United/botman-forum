hi, i downloaded me stripper2 yesterday and it worked first time i installed it on my server. since i am making maps for a long time i was very familiar with the entities and had no problems creating my first str.cfg.
to do this the simplest way i wanto post my technique first:
first i decompiled the map to a map file, then i opend it in valves hammer editor, then i added all my entities, i saved it as a map again.
then i opend the map file in wordpad and in the bottom where all my new entities. all i had to do is just copy and past them in my ..._str.cfg file.
also i had to modify them since the map file is in the "classname" "value" format and i changed it to classname/value.

altough this is a timesaving technique (since u can see all the values and specially origins in the hammer editor) it still took me a long time.

so now here comes my offer:
you send me all your map_str.cfg files and i make a website to download them off.
that will make it very easy to get new files and you dont have to make them your self.
my email adress is th1alb@gmx.net    ,please also include a description of what your cfg adds or strips and all files that u added that dont come with half-life.

my third offer is that i will run your cfgs on my server in case u are making them for fun and dont run a server your self

and now i have a question for stripper2 since i am still a "noob".

my first thoughts where to just put one of the crates in dust somewhere else and then see peoples faces like "wtf is up with my map"
i found out pretty quick that u can pretty much only create and strip entities. my second thought was to remove the light_enviroment and make the map for nightvision gogles and pitch dark, maybe add some extra light entities in a different color. so my question is, is it even possible to add light entities or does all the light get compiled in the map by the RAD compiler? i figure u cant add light entities :((

well i got to go but ill post here soon again

well if you have the neo version of tfc you can  neotf_lightstyle c (A "being the darkest"--Z "being the lightest")
and
 neotf_makelight (rgb) (size)  

 example:

neotf_makelight 255 0 0 20   (would make the light red) and 20 would be the size.
you can make the lights white too, just play with the colors till you like them.  to get an idea what it looks like , download the map  nao_badlands.bsp   it's at  www.girlpower.com i think.

nao_badlands has nothing to do with NeoTF, I made that map for my server, if you wish to use it on your own server please ask me first.

dude, u make a map and u dont want people to play it? if people would run my map on their server i would be honored. o well, back to the topic. i actially run a cs server, i used to play neo-tfc all the time, its so much more fun then regular tfc. i loved this one map, i forget what it was called, there was a soccerball in the middle u had to try to keep it in your base and ur team protects u, there were 4 teams. how ever, if it is possible to add lights there, u should be able to add them in cs too, since every mod is based on the same hl-engine. i just thought the light gets rendered in the map when u compile it, so even if u would remove a light entity, the wall it was shining on should still be bright. tell me if im wrong

Rob if you don't want ppl downloading it and playing it, don't put it up on the website to download. the lights look cool and looks like you spent sometime makeing that map, but the rest of it ...well.... errm..    nevermind.  no ammo, all grates gone, all doors gone. This is just to let ppl know whats in the map.
        lights look good tho.
 and i didn't say nao_badlands was part of the NEO. i said you can see what the lights look like in that map. the lights ARE the same.

I think its more that his map was created for his server to be used by his server. I donno if you've ever played on GP2 or even heard of it, but rob has managed to do some... intresting/frciking unbelievable stuff... with his server. I'm not possitive, but I believe for the map to work right it needs to be played off his server.
