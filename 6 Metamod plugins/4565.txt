You can't play a sound if you don't have the sound file.  ;)

Create the sound you want to play.  Use Stripper2 to strip out the original button.  Add a new button in with the same origin and brush model as the original button, but change the target to a trigger_multiple.  Add the trigger_multiple that is triggered by the button and have the trigger_multiple trigger the sound as well as open the door.

See the crossfire_str.cfg file for an example of spawning a trigger_multiple in a level.

You could also use a multimanager instead of a trigger_multiple.

See some Half-Life mapping tutorial websites for information on how to use trigger_multiple or multimanager.

Oh, don't forget to PRECACHE_SOUND() in the Stripper2 .cfg file to precache your sound so that it will get sent to clients that don't already have this sound.

"speak/hgrunt/clik clik oh! sh*t! clik we! have! hostiles!"

hgrunt sounds already exist on the client (they're in the valve\pak0.pak file).

Since you aren't playing a .wav file, not precaching it doesn't seem to cause a problem.  The 'speak' command works a little differently than the usual 'sound' key where you have a .wav file that you will play (those need to be precached or you get an error and the engine crashes with a message about it not being precached).
