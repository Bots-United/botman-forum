This is a question concerning cs.

I have made a match automation mod for cs. The problem is I use the clientCommand "chooseTeam" to change to players teams at halftime, and sometimes the commad never gets issued by the hl engine due to players spamming buy/switch weapon commands. 
I worte a function to sort out most of the spam, but some commands like menuselect i cant sort out as they can be for the team and model selection. 

The question:
Is there anyway I can changeTeam for a player or just put the in the spectator team wihtout issueing the "chooseteam" command?
I was thinking that if I put them as spectators while they await sorting they cant spam so much.

Does anyone know how the autoTeamBalance code works? 

Also, I havent been able to select a model for the players, just the team. I tried different variations of 
        ("menuselect 2;menuselect 2;slot 10);
etc.


Thanks.

      g_engfuncs.pfnSetClientKeyValue( clientIndex, g_engfuncs.pfnGetInfoKeyBuffer( pPlayer->edict() ), "team", pPlayer->m_szTeamName );

      // notify everyone's HUD of the team change
      MESSAGE_BEGIN( MSG_ALL, gmsgTeamInfo );
            WRITE_BYTE( clientIndex );
            WRITE_STRING( pPlayer->m_szTeamName );
      MESSAGE_END();

      MESSAGE_BEGIN( MSG_ALL, gmsgScoreInfo );
            WRITE_BYTE( clientIndex );
            WRITE_SHORT( pPlayer->pev->frags );
            WRITE_SHORT( pPlayer->m_iDeaths );
            WRITE_SHORT( 0 );
            WRITE_SHORT( g_pGameRules->GetTeamIndex( pPlayer->m_szTeamName ) + 1 );
      MESSAGE_END();
}

this help?
