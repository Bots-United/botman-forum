Well.... I always knew about this forum... but for some reason just never checked it out. Now I'm here, and finding it quite interesting...

For starters, I thought I'd let you all know about an adminmod plugin I made for the MM moster plugin a while back... basically, it just puts an adminmod interface on the commands (specifically, spawning monsters next to people, and the monster spawn cvar) so you dont have to give out rcon to use it. Plus, the monsters are numbered, so you dont have to type out their names.

You can find it here.... let me know if you hate it, like it, need some changes... etc.
