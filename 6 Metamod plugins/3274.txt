I did a search to see if anyone had posted abotu this b4, certainly im not the first :-p  i found some info, but the examples they provided still give me this error,

Host_Error: UserMsg: Not Present On Client 66

I get that not when i first enter the server(LAN WINDOWS), but when i join the Terrorist team.  the Ct team gives a "...Client 67" error.  On the bright side it does change the sky :-\ 

Any ideas ?

//Removed DUST Background *hopefully*

[add] 
//Changes Sky to Backalley *hopefully*
{ 
classname/worldspawn 
max_range/9999
skyname/backalley
startdark/1
}

If you just want to change the skyname, use my Darkulator.

i tried ur darkulator but it saves a diffrent version of the map.  im tring to make it so i dont have to have the clients download anything but get to play a 'new map'  but its all good it works that way, just not on my 95 machine :-p

Save the map .bsp file, rename the old one to something like mapname.old, then rename the new one to mapname.bsp.  As long as the only thing that you've changed is the skyname then clients won't have to download it.  If you change the lightlevels then clients will be required to download the new map.
