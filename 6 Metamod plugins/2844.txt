this is config for TFC (2fort) im workin on.. and just for fun im addin some kool sprite funnels..
only problem is they can only be actived once per map.. thats not the question tho.. i could fix that by addin a lot of sets of them trigged by different targetnames... but the question is about the targetnames..i saw long ago someone that had used ripent to do this same thing.. but could trigger the funnels anytime they wanted.. maybe with a console command? how could i do the targetnames were i could trigger it when ever i wanted and it was not soemthing in the map like im testing with..(the red respawn door opening)
any help.. or a better way of doin this would be greatly thanked :)

Anything that can get "used" (like buttons) can be used to trigger targets.  Perhaps you can place an invisible button somewhere that some can use to fire the targetname.

when i press the hidden button the sound wont stop playin! its looping..ok on a mapping site i found this..

QUOTE:

Flags for ambient_generic:

There are a number of flags available to you for use with this entity.

Play Everywhere (1) - This sets the sound's range to be the entire level. 

Small Radius (2) - This sets the sounds range to a small radius. 

Medium Radius (4) - Ditto, medium radius. 

Large Radius (8) - Ditto, large radius. 

Start Silent (16) - If this flag is enabled, the ambient_generic entity must be triggered to play its sound. 

Is NOT Looped (32) - Use this to specify a "play once" sound. When this flag is enabled, each time the entity is triggered, it will play the sound. Otherwise, triggering the entity will alternate between turning it on and off.




i see the "is NOT Looped" is post to be set to "32" for the sound to only play once but what setting in the ambient_generic is used for this?
it could not be:

code:

isnotlooped/32


could it??
iv played with all the keys/valves i have and none of them are doin what im lookin for..
any help is greatly thanked..

[edit]
wow i said alot for that little question.. ill try to keep it shorter next time :)

For "ambient_generic", the spawnflags is a bitmask used to control the radius and looping.

Here's the bitmask values...

code:
#define AMBIENT_SOUND_STATIC                  0      // medium radius attenuation
#define AMBIENT_SOUND_EVERYWHERE            1
#define AMBIENT_SOUND_SMALLRADIUS            2
#define AMBIENT_SOUND_MEDIUMRADIUS            4
#define AMBIENT_SOUND_LARGERADIUS            8
#define AMBIENT_SOUND_START_SILENT            16
#define AMBIENT_SOUND_NOT_LOOPING            32

So setting spawnflags to 1 would play the sound everywhere.  Setting spawnflags to 2+16=18 would play the sound with a small radius and start silent.  Setting spawnflags to 8+16+32=56 would play the sound with a large radius, start silent and would not loop.

Since you used 49 this would be 32+16+1, which is everywhere, start silent, not looping.

Some of the wave files have a "loop" bit set inside them and will always loop.  Perhaps you are using one of these.  Try picking some different .wav files and see if they do the same thing (or try creating your own wave file, 11Khz or 22Khz, 8 bit, mono).

ahhh well.. like they say u learn something new everyday... i did not know the spawnflag was just a total of all the flags u wanted... i thought all the flags had different keys/valves..
once again thx.. and this wav im using is a "looping" wav and wont stop no matter what the flags are set to.. thanks for this info.. thats what i thought the "no looping" flag so for.. to stop whatever sound the "ambient_generic" was playing.. did not know it would not stop even if it was set to "no looping" thx..
