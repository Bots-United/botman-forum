I did a search in the forums and saw that you were possibly considering doing a metamod tool to replace all weapons of one sort with another, I was wondering if that was still a possibility and/or in the works.  I have great interest in seeing that  tool :)  I've found your stripper2 tool more than useful, I love it! keep up the good work!

No, unfortunetly I don't have the time to work on any new projects right now and I probably won't be able to find the time to work on anything new later on.

Maybe that will already be part of the Half-Life2 SDK.  :)

But for closed source mods, there'd be no real way of doing server side mods then =\

No, what I'm saying is that since Alfred (from AdminMOD) works for Valve, it's quite possible that the SDK for Half-Life2 will include code needed to create server side plugins for any MOD right out of the box (no development required).

At least 6 or 8 months.

I noticed a long time ago that his return e-mail address on the hlcoders e-mail list (at valvesoftware.com) was alfred@valvesoftware.com and since Valve doesn't give valvesoftware.com e-mail addresses to the general public, he must be working for Valve.  :)
