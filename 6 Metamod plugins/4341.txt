This is out of the TFC .fgd file...
code:
@BaseClass = TFCriteria
[
      //#description This BaseClass provides criteria properties that must be met in order for goal to activate. Many HL entities can use TF Criteria properties.\n\nb[Note:]b In Goal Activation Bitfields you can set goal to activate if criteria is NOT met. For example setting 'Team' to Blue means everyone can activate goal except for Blue team.\n\nThe first set of properties are criteria related to player.
      //#usage Remember you are able to set so goal is activated if Criteria is NOT met. This can solve many set-ups, like needig a goal to be activated by 2 out of 3 teams, or 3 out of 4. Or to be able to restrict goal from a particular class.\n\nFor more info about checking a goals state, see <A HREF="http://info.gamedesign.net/designtuts/Lesson2/Lesson2-1.htm">Introduction to Goals and Goal States</A>.

item_tfgoal, uses TFCriteria and the 'playerclass' setting comment says "You can only select 1, you can't add these up"
