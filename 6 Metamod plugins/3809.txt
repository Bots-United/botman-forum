i had zombies on the 2fort sniper deckand i noticed that when they stare out into nothingness and don't attack, they make excellent walls to hide behind yet still see through for sniping. i made some zombies spawn inside the ground (-50 on the Z axis) but when they see people they just walk right out of the ground and start attacking :(

is there a way to make them either not attack or just stay with their feet planted in the ground? i've also tried burring them even deeper but that doesn't work either.

Nope, Monsters will always attack players.

You could try using Stripper2 and spawn the monster model in the map at the same position (it won't do anything if you spawn it as a non-monster entity, something like "func_button" for example).

lol well the thing i was doin here was having human shields all over the place. you know that map 2fort? i have 4 scies with their feet and heads in the walls so they cant move.... they act as shields for the machine gunner lol.

thx for the tip, will it make the entity solid and the size of the model or can you shoot through them and the size of the entity be specified?

The size of the entity and whether or not it is a blocking entity will depend on what entity you spawn.

See a Half-Life mapping tutorial website to learn more about which entities will block player movement, bullets, etc.

You could make a invisable box where the zombie is in where the player CAN go in but the zombie CANT go out of......

Not without creating code to support this behavior.
