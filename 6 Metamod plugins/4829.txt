Did you look at the example plugins included with the metamod source code download?

One of the example just logs each time a function was called.  You could start with this example and modify that to suit your needs.

I actually started out with the wdmisc-plugin that gets all the "log-lines", and was thinking about to check for a "player disconnect" line and then parse it with sscanf or something, to get the "uniqueid/steamid".

its at this point i need some assistance, how to implement the functions to check the players latency, if this information is available just as the client disconnects..

any better way to do this?
