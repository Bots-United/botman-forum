Hello botman,

first of all, thanks for your very useful plugin.

here is my question :

i have made a sprite (gra.spr) from an animated gif (8 img).
i'd like to display a frame/s (so 8 sec for the total animation)

how can i do this ?

i've tried with the following code :

{
   classname/env_sprite
   PRECACHE_SPRITE(sprites/gra.spr)
   targetname/img1
   framerate/1
   rendermode/5
   renderamt/255
   scale/1.0
   spawnflags/2
   model/sprites/gra.spr
   origin/-386 2000 53
}

{
   classname/trigger_auto
   delay/0.5
   target/mm1
   origin/-386 2000 53
}

{
   classname/multi_manager
   spawnflags/1
   targetname/mm1
   img1/1
   mm1/8
   origin/-386 2000 53
}

but it doesn't work. it only displays the first frame of the spr during a very short time (less than 1 sec) and display it again after 8 sec. why doesn't it cycle throught the other frames ?

in one shoot : how can i convert animated (loop) gif to animated (loop) sprite with the same delay between frames ?

Thank you for your answer.

I think all sprites are fixed at 10 frames per second.  Go back and make 10 copies of each of your current frames and sequence them, i.e....

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3, etc.

ok but what is the framerate key for so ?

i thought that the framerate key sets how many frame per second the sprite is played.

i also read in this forum an exemple with a classname sprite and a key frame. but i couldn't find any information about this key frame.
do you know what is it for ?

Thanks

Some of the key/values pairs may exist and may not actually get used.  I don't know any of the details about animated sprites since all of this is handled in the Half-Life engine.

You'll get a LOT more information about map entities by looking at mapping tutorial websites than you will on my forum.
