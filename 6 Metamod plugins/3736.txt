Did you already have metamod installed or did you have to install metamod?

If you had to install metamod, are you getting the metamod welcome message when the server starts up (see the ReadMe.txt file included with the Stripper2 plugin for details on getting metamod installed properly).

If you have metamod installed properly and see the metamod welcome message when the server starts up, do you see the Monster welcome message right after the metamod welcome message?  If not, you don't have the Monster plugin .dll file installed in the right place, or you didn't modify the metamod.ini file properly (again, see the ReadMe.txt file that comes with the Monster plugin for details on installing the Monster plugin .dll file and modifying the metamod.ini file).

I had metamod installed previous to installing the stripper2 plugin.  I am getting the metamod message on startup.  I am also getting the Stripper2 startup (those two lines saying that it starts up).  Also, after the server is started up, i do the "meta list" command, and the Stripper2 plugin is there and running.  

But, while ingame, i can still see, purchase, and use the weapon(s) that i had restricted in the .cfg file.  Any ideas?

You cannot strip weapons out of Counter-Strike using Stripper2.

Stripper2 will ONLY strip out entities that SPAWN when the map is loaded.  If you don't see something laying on the ground that you can pick up, then Stipper2 can't remove it.

In Counter-Strike weapons are GIVEN to the player internally in the MOD DLL code.  Stripper2 can not modify anything internally in the Counter-Strike MOD DLL code, so it can't prevent weapon from being bought by the player, nor can it prevent weapons from being dropped or picked up after being dropped.

Stripper2 can only remove things that are spawned at the time the map is loaded (like the weapons that are laying on the ground in Half-Life deathmatch).

AdminMOD has an option to do this, but I don't know how well it works (apparently people who know which console commands to send to the server can bypass the AdminMOD buy menu blocking).

Search the AdminMOD forum for details.

Oh oh!

I wish I'd thought of this before ;).

With HLGuard you can block console commands. Install HLGuard and mimic the config used to block "cheat cvars", I just don't suggest you keep the message: "user just tried to use the cheat CVAR buy weapon whatever".

I know nothing about and very little about hlguard (I looked at the scripting once and got a headach)... but I'm sure its possible.

You also could probably use... grr, Logalizer? What ever its called it works hand and hand with AdminMod so you can probably find a link for it off their site ( http://adminmod.org ).

HLGuard is at, http://unitedadmins.com/HLGuard_DL-en.aspx - need to be a UA member, so sign up (its worth it).
