Subject: Easy way to Determine Spawn Angle

One of our clan members is setting up the map configuration files to use the Monster plug-in on our public server.

However, they are having a tough time getting the monsters facing angle right.

If any of you who use or have used this plug-in have any tips in regards to determining monsters facing angles please share your knowledge via a reply.

Is there by chance a tool that is available that they could use to determine this while they are getting the coordinates based on the angle they are facing when they note them?

I haven't had time to read all the threads under this forums topic to see if this this question already addressed. So please forgive me if this is a repeat question and post a reply to the previous thread that address it.

Thanks in advance,

Valve Hammer Editor and WinBSP. Use them in conjunction to decompile and look at maps. Finding coordinates/angles is easy then.

WinBSPC is lame. Use the <b>RipEnt</b> tool included with <b>Zoner's Half-Life Compile Tools</b>. It creates a list of entities from a map which you can edit and import back into the map. http://www.Valve-ERC.com

Ummmm, but ripent doesn't give you a .map file which you NEED if you are going to load the map into a 3D viewer/editor that will show you spawn angles.

Ripent is good for looking at or editing the entities in a map, but that wasn't the question.

Blah WinBSP is the only decent decompiler for HL, and does a damn good job for what you want to do. It leaves all the entities in tact, which is really what matters, the rest of it is brushes and those mean nothing when using the -onlyents command to recompile a map.

Thanks for the input everyone. I have passed that on to who is doing our monster config files.
