--------------------------------------------------
Well i tryed this all day and i can't seem to figure this out.

I want to strip the cs_dust.wad out of dust and replace it with a different wad like for example cs_office.wad

If i wanted to replace it with a custom wad would i have to pecache it.?   i know i would have to put it in a res file though ..

How would i do that?


Thank you in advance for any help... iam stumped....

WADs aren't embedded in map files.

They are usually in a .pak file (download PakExplorer) or they are in the MOD directory as .wad files.

Sometimes level designers will embed a texture directly into the .bsp map file, but this isn't a WAD, it's a texture and it can't be removed from the .bsp file without rebuilding the .bsp from the map source.

You can try overriding a texture embedded in a .bsp file by adding that texture name (using a different texture) to one of the existing WAD files.

Replacing one WAD file for another WAD file with completely different textures is just a matter of creating an alternate texture for every texture in the existing WAD file (making sure to name them the same) and adding those new textures to the replacement WAD file (making sure the .wad file also has the same name).

All of these changes will only occur on your machine.  It won't change the textures displayed on any clients who connect to your server.

Thanks for that quick reply. Sorry i wasnt able to read this until now. 

Sorry if i dont understand this right. but I think i want just to replace it then, i think. ok this is what i want to do.

i took this out of the print out from the bsp_tool like said in read me.

Printing 106 Entities...

Entity index      : 0
Entity origin (X) : 0.000000
              (Y) : 0.000000

Key/Value         : wad/\sierra\half-life\valve\halflife.wad;\sierra\half-life\valve\decals.wad;\sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_dust.wad;


And this last entry  is saying that its going to use cs_dust.wad.  Well i want it to make it so instead it would look and use another wad. for example cs_office.wad.

I actually have a 2 custom wads for dust. one is grassdust.wad and another is something different, its taken from fusion pack. well any how i know i would have to make my clients download them first, but the hard part is how do i make them use it. 


ok now what i want to do is create the custom map config for de dust so it would , like in one of your examples use one of these 4 wads, and alternate. each itme it loads the map it would be different wad. like different seasons. and i know how some people only play dust and aztec all the time i just wanted to make this more intresting.

My bad for typing so much. i would love the help. I really want to do this, i think this would be a cool look for this or any good map. I hope all this crap i said made sense. sorry maybe i should of started like that from the beggining. lol oh well....


Thanks again....

"Well i want it to make it so instead it would look and use another wad. for example cs_office.wad."

That's fine, as long as cs_office.wad contains ALL of the same named textures as was in cs_dust.wad (or at least contains ALL of the textures that are actually used in the maps that load cs_dust.wad).

For example, if cs_dust.wad contains textures named...

smallbit
blueslate
treebranch
lite457
burnedbox

...then when you create cs_office.wad, you MUST include these same textures named...

smallbit
blueslate
treebranch
lite457
burnedbox

They can be a different size than the originals and they obviously will contain different art, but the names MUST be the same between cs_dust.wad and cs_office.wad, you can't just name the .wad file to something differently and expect the engine to find the texture names somehow (since those names probably won't exist inside another .wad file).

Ok i understand more now how this all works..

This is what iam trying to do:
[strip]
wad/\sierra\half-life\valve\halflife.wad;\sierra\half-life\valve\decals.wad;\sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_dust.wad;
[add]
{
   wad/\sierra\half-life\valve\halflife.wad;\sierra\half-life\valve\decals.wad;\sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_office.wad;
}

>>What else would i need to include here? 

>>And how do i find out the names of textures used in a wad so i can put them here?

Another questing since when i tryed just to rename cs_office wad to cs_dust wad and when i loaded it didnt have any textures. so does that mean if i wanted to change the seasons like i said before i would only need to replace the textures and not the WAD files and it would work?

or do i still dont get it?

Another thing coming back to what i was dooing before i have the cs_grassdust.wad, and when i have that rename to the cs_dust wad and loaded it all works fine. If i would use your striper2 here would i still have to load textures here too.? like you said for cs_office.wad

iam a little confused on this:
>>then when you create cs_office.wad, you MUST include these same textures named...<<

i dont want to create cause i dont know how. i just want to use the ones allready in cs cs_office.wad is stock with in counter strike.


>>They can be a different size than the originals and they obviously will contain different art, but the names MUST be the same between cs_dust.wad and cs_office.wad, you can't just name the .wad file to something differently and expect the engine to find the texture names somehow (since those names probably won't exist inside another .wad file).<<

And here are you talking about that i have to change to cs_office name to cs_dust.wad or are you talking about the textures names.?

I am sorry for so many questind and Thanks for helping noob like me with this again.

You can [strip] the .wad line by itself.  The wad information is part of the "worldspawn" entity, so you would have to...

[strip]worldspawn

...and then [add] the "worldspawn" entity back in again with the "wad" key/value modified to what you want.  Leave all the other Key/Value fields in the "worldspawn" entity alone and just change the "wad" key.  Use my BSP tools to dump the entities in the map to see what the default key/values are for "worldspawn" for each map.

Wally (search for it with www.google.com "half-life wally wad") can be used to look at the textures within a .wad file.  Wally can also be used to create a new .wad file by importing textures that you want to use in that .wad file.

Here's the way the Half-Life engine handles textures...

1) The .bsp map file has a surface with a texture.  The engine needs to load the texture that matches that name (let's just say the texture is called "light7up").

2) The engine searches all of the .wad files that the map was compiled with for that texture.  The engine gets this list of .wad files from the "worldspawn" entity "wad" key.  It will contain something like "goldbuild\valve\xeno.wad;goldbuild\valve\liquids.wad;goldbuild\valve\halflife.wad".  The directory names aren't used (i.e. it ignores the "goldbuild" part of the pathname).

3. For each .wad file listed in the "worldspawn" "wad" key/value, the engine will search through that file looking for the matching texture name (and it will search them IN THAT ORDER).  In this case, the engine will search xeno.wad for "light7up" first.  If it doesn't find the texture, it will search "liquids.wad" for "light7up", then it will search "halflife.wad" for "light7up".

4. If the engine doesn't find the texture after searching all of the .wad files, it will fail with an error message and quit.

Let's say you wanted to replace "light7up" in the "halflife.wad" with your own version.  You can easily do this by creating a "light7up" image (using MS Paint, Photoshop, PaintShopPro, etc) and adding "light7up" to the "xeno.wad" file using Wally.  Since the engine will search the .wad files in the order specified in the "wad" key of the "worldspawn" entity, you can insert a new one in a file that will be searched before the .wad file where it normally is found.

You can also create a brand new .wad file (let's call it "MyWad.wad" and use Stripper2 to [strip] out the worldspawn entity and [add] a new worldspawn entity with the "wad" key changed to have your new WAD file first in the list (i.e. something like "goldbuild\valve\MyWad.wad;goldbuild\valve\xeno.wad;goldbuild\valve\liquids.wad;goldbuild\valve\halflife.wad"

wow.. the things with editing and creating your own WAD files is very nice i will play with them and try to figure them out later. Thanks for that info i needed that too, but this is what i did for now.

//cs_dust_str.cfg

[strip]
worldspawn
sierra\half-life\valve\halflife.wad;\sierra\half-life\valve\decals.wad;\sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_dust.wad;

[add]
{
   classname/worldspawn
   wad/sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_grassdust.wad;sierra\half-life\valve\halflife.wad;sierra\half-life\valve\decals.wad;
}


..The file cs_grassdust.wad was originally cs_dust.wad i just renamed it to have it cusomdownloded be clients. Iam just said that wondering if that would be an issue. ? hope not.

My directory structure is c:\Sierra\Counter-Strike\cstrike...

I was wondering those entries in cs_dust map have half-life directory named and some how my map still find the original cs_dust.wad... hmm weired.

Ok thats just a side note..LOL

i put the cs_grassdust.wad in my cstrike folder and added the entry to my res file.

its just it still dosent load the correct wad file for some reason. 
what am i doing wrong?

I know that when i loaded and used your example of your cs_assault_str.cfg it worked fine. so for that matter the program works fine.

here is a part of the de_dust.txt from bsp_tool..

This...

[strip] 
worldspawn 
sierra\half-life\valve\halflife.wad;\sierra\half-life\valve\decals.wad;\sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_dust.wad;
should just be this...

[strip] 
worldspawn
...and this...

[add]
{
  classname/worldspawn
  wad/sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_grassdust.wad;sierra\half-life\valve\halflife.wad;sierra\half-life\valve\decals.wad;
}
...should be this...

[add]
{
   classname/worldspawn
   MaxRange/8000
   skyname/des
   message/DUST by Dave Johnston - for CounterStrike
   mapversion/220
   wad/sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_grassdust.wad;sierra\half-life\valve\halflife.wad;sierra\half-life\valve\decals.wad;
}
What textures do you have in cs_grassdust.wad that you are replacing from the other wads?  Also make sure you cs_grassdust.wad file is actually in the 'half-life\cstrike' directory.

I looked up the textures in both wads with wally and they all are named the same but in cs_grassdust.wad they look diferent thats about it.

but when i try to load the config the texture is still not changed like nothing happend.

also i was looking at this line
wad/sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_grassdust.wad

since this wad is in c:\sierra\counter-strike\cstrike 

directory do i have to change this line or it just does it to the wright directory by it self.  just wondering...

i also tryed with this changed directory with no luck also ..

Another thing you asked about different textures that i was using in that wad.

if i was using a different wad for the same map
how would i replace the testures that were in that different wad
 what would be the command line.
( this is kinda a future question since it kinda came up with this problem.) 
It was on my mind so i asked ( not very important at this time :)  )


too bad i can attach files here cause it would be a little easier to show you.


Thanks again botman..

I would make the directory path name exactly match the example that uses the 'cstrike' directory (\sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_dust.wad), so it would be...

\sierra\half-life\cstrike\cs_grassdust.wad

...like I show in my example.

Maybe the wad filename is too long.  Try shortening it to "cs_grass.wad" (to keep it in the old MS-DOS 8.3 format).

"if i was using a different wad for the same map
how would i replace the testures that were in that different wad"

I'm not exactly sure what your question is but it sounds like you are asking "How to I change the wad each time I want to run the map so that I can run the map with different wads at different times?", and the answer is "You can't really do that".

Stripper2 allows you to randomly pick from a set of items to spawn, so you could create a group of 3 or 4 "worldspawn" entities and spawn one of them at random (see the Stripper2 ReadMe.txt file and the included examples for creating a randomized group).  But you can't specify which one you want to use at any particular time (they will be picked from randomly).

Sup botman its me again. yea i know. :)

ok i changed the cs_grassdust.wad to simply cs_grass.wad 

then just be sure i made additiotional directories to match the sierra\half-life\cstrike and copied the wad there and runed it.

no progress.

then i changed the config to match my original structure which is sierra\counter-strike\cstrike\cs_grass.wad

nothing here also.

its for some reason acts like it isnt stripping anything at all. i cant figure it out 
I really got hiped up at this cause i was looking for something like this program like this on for a very long time. Damn thats just my luck.

Ive been changing it around for at least an hour and realoding the server and no luck.

Plzzzzzzz help.. 

Thanks botman...

I don't know what else to tell you to try.

I've never done this sort of thing myself and can't help you any more than I already have.

As a last ditch effort, you can simply rename the .wad file you don't want to use (cs_dust.wad in this case), then create your own version of cs_dust.wad with all of the texture names that existed in cs_dust.wad (changing the textures that you want to change).  You won't have to strip out the "worldspawn" entity, becase you aren't changing anything in the "worldspawn" keys, you're just changing the contents of cs_dust.wad to use different textures.

Other than that, you're on your own.

It should be impossible, and if you do manage to do it, even by making clients download the wad files they're going to get errors with your version of the map being diffrent from yours.

Yes the worldspawn can be changed, although most functions in the worldspawn cannot be changed, such as default light level. You can toy with level fade in/out though, which I think gives a cool effect :).

At best your only ever going to be able to change your client's textures and no one else, but I think steam checks for this now?

If it were possible it could be considered a security flaw where you could over right people's textures... just a thought :).

Correct, you certainly won't be able to play on another server if you modify your client .wad files (those are MD5 checksum checked if I remember correctly).

You should still be able to modify the client .wad file if you were the one creating the server (playing with bots, for example).

Oh well.

Hey thanks guys for looking at this..

But i am not really changing anything, well not pernamently. iam just wanted to tell the map to use a different texture then the original.

The texture that i called cs_grassdust.wad is originally called cs_dust.wad and its a replacement. So when i replace it and load the map then it works fine. But the problem is that the clients still have the original cs_dust.wad and it dosent change for them cause when it checks it comes back as that they allready have it.  
Thats why ive decided to call it something different.
Well if you guys are interested here is the website that i got the wad from

http://cs.hostbox.nl/index.php?pid=3

you can try it for your self. you just have to overrite your original cs_dust.wad.  And load any map that uses that wad will look different.

Personally i really like the change and i wanted i modify so ppl will play like that too. But you know how most ppl are about downloading custom maps :(
,,  so thats where i thought you plugin would come in.

Well thanks again for taking a look.
And let me know if you guys like that WAD.

Laters....
