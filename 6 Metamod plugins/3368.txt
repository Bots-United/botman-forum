Hi, I have managed to add some text to a wall on crossfire (the yellow text), but I wondered how far this can it be edited i.e. test colour, size and style?  Or more important can I add a clan logo for everyone to see on a wall?

Thanks in advance for your time

The color of decals can't be changed.  If you use a WAD editor (like Wally) you can look at the 255th index color of the palette to see what color a decal will be when it is sprayed.

If you wanted to change this, you can modify your decal.wad file (by using Wally to change the mip lump image and saving the changes), but this won't effect what is seen on other clients since they will be using the default decal.wad file.

Thanks botman, I'm getting there, but a little confused sometimes, so a decal is like that "botman" text on the crossfire wall?  Also I take it there is no way I can't put an image on a wall like a 256 colour spay paint image I have when I play?

Thanks in advance for your time here.

Yes, the "botman" example is spraying 6 separate decals.

Go download Wally from here...

http://www.telefragged.com/wally/

...and you can browse through the decals.wad file to see what's available for decals.

The only way to make custom images is to use a sprite (which will always turn to face the player and can't be sprayed flat on a wall).  See the "botman.spr" example in the Stripper2 zip file for a simple sprite.

You create an "infodecal" entity.  See the example .cfg files included with my Stripper2 metamod plugin.
