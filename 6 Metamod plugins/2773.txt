Can anyone help me to put a vehicle in assault for the CT, so they can "Storm the front!" with it?

Anyone alive in here? Hello! I'm starting to feel kind of lonely in here... hello?

Have you tried doing this yourself?

Usually when someone doesn't answer your question it means that they don't know the answer.

If you haven't tried it yourself first, do that.  Then if you have problems you can show what you have tried to do by posting the config file stuff you are using.  Someone may be able to point out what you are missing or point out that you can't do what you are trying to do, but don't just ask someone to show you how to do what you want without trying it yourself first.
