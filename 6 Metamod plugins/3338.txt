Hiya

Right, ive put weapon_mp5navy amongst all the others in stripper2.cfg.

It does not remove the mp5 from the map that I play on, they are still layed on the ground.

If anyone has any ideas ?

Stripper2 is deffinatley working because its removed all vehicles which ive told it to do.
(speaking of vehicles, can they be cloned and put elsewhere on the map?)

Thanks,
Edd

Stripper2 will only strip out items that are spawned when the map is loaded.  If you are referring to Counter-Strike, the weapons in CS are not spawned when the map is loaded.  The weapons are purchased by the player and created from within the MOD code (which Stripper2 has no access to).  Weapons thrown on the ground are also spawned by the CS MOD code and Stripper2 can't prevent that from happening.

When using Stripper2, think Half-Life deathmatch.  That's the kind of stuff it can strip out, things that are always laying around that anyone can pick up.

Sorry if I didnt word my first post correctly.

The weapons are layed out around the map, like normal Half-life deathmatch would be. Weapon buying is disabled... we want to make a sort of knife/pistol only server.

Hey edd, hey botman!

I noticed you said stripper 2 has no access to CS weapon spawn code, I managed to intercept it using the "edict_t* pfnCreateNamedEntity(int className)" funtion, however, weapons are spawned as a "weaponbox" and so far I have no idea how to tell what is in that weaponbox unless I get all the weaponbox stuff from the SDK and stick it in my "botman templated" plug-in. I am having severe trouble with that as I get several "unresolved externals" and no idea where to find them.

Perhaps you could try, in your Stripper2 plugin, to expirement with the weaponboxes being spawned in pfnCreateNamedEntity, problem is, how do you remove the weapon box before it is Touched by the player?

...ummmmm.  My point was that Stripper2 (as it is) doesn't allow you to remove Counter-Strike weapons since they aren't normally spawned as entities when the map gets loaded.

I'm not familiar with whether you can create a map entity that caused a weapon to spawn and be picked up by a player or not.  I don't play Counter-Strike and thus haven't seen any maps where this type of gameplay would occur.  There might be AdminMOD or metamod plugins that allow Counter-Strike weapons to be spawned (or blocked from purchase), but again, since I don't play Counter-Strike, I can't tell you if these exist or not.

So am I correct when I say, Stripper cannot remove weapons from maps in CS unless they are spawned by stripper ?

Correct, sort of.

Stripper2 can't remove weapons from Counter-Strike.  Stripper2 can't even remove anything spawned by Stripper2.  The stripping part in the Stripper2 plugin happens BEFORE the spawning part, so if you make a Stripper2 .cfg file to strip out all crossbows, then add a crossbow, the crossbow that you added will not get stripped out.

If you want to prevent weapons from being purchased in Counter-Strike you should do this using AdminMOD (since there's a AdminMOD feature that supports this).

unfortunately, the admin mod feature that disables buying is flawed. We have it on the jolt road rage server for ammo only buying (so its mainly pistols/knifes only if there are not spawned weapons on the map) A lot of people can buy using the console (but, menuselect etc) and it has no effect :( I was think of a way to stop weapons being spawned somehow from buying but thats where all my weaponbox stuff comes in :(

Ok, i'll share if you share...
I run a CStrike server & use stripper2.
Everything here works, kinda.

The "BOTMAN" is screwed up, i don't understand
textures, classname/func_wall thing at ALL.
I NEED HELP!!! If you know, please respond...

The strip teleport is kinda weird...

Also, I get 20 nades the first round, after 
that i get 1??? 

cherry.spr & chinamuz.wav are my creations.
You have to put cherry.spr & chinamuz.wav in your fy_iceworld.res file. if you dont want your
users to download these, just take this out.

To the best of my knowledge, "func_buyzone" entities aren't used any more.  They are a hold-over from old CS maps where the mapper had to specify the buy zone.  Now CS creates these on the fly based on the player spawn position.
