Hello,

I have problem with sripped2, I cant get it srip that I want :)

I have some aim maps (weapons on the ground, players don´t need to buy them) on my CS-Server and I want to strip the awp on the ground from some maps...

I have stipped2 up and running...

I made a costum cfg for a map...

[strip]
hostage_entity  
info_bomb_target
info_hostage_rescue
func_bomb_target
func_buyzone
func_escapezone
func_hostage_rescue
weapon_awp

But it wont srip out the awp...

If I change the map config to:

[strip]
hostage_entity  
info_bomb_target
info_hostage_rescue
func_bomb_target
func_buyzone
func_escapezone
func_hostage_rescue
weapon_awp
armoury_entity

Then I blow all the weapons away :(

###########################################
ARMOURY_ENTITY- This allows you to have weapons on the ground and you can choose what gun and how many there are.
###########################################

Whay cant I only take the awp away??? 

Plz help me with this is a little confusing... 

// Have one map with scouts, in the middle of the map on the floor it is a awp... that fu***n awp destroy the whole map :(

The AWP that you see in the map is probably not a "weapon_awp", but is actually a "armoury_entity"

You will want to strip out the "armoury_entity" using it's location.  For example...

code:
[strip]
armoury_entity (1050 -950 745)
armoury_entity (-1250 320 -295)


...you can create a listenserver in Counter-Strike or use my BSP viewer from the BSP tools to find the X,Y,Z coordinates of entities (see the ReadMe.txt file included with Stripper2 on how to do this).

Okie I wolud tried that...

I started your program bspviewer and looked at  lagging (3fps) windowscreen :P And I flew a rond at the map..

how exactly must I be, do I need the exact cordinates for the awp or can I gestimate the posision because it is a armoury_entity?

Is there a program that i can run a bsp file trou and get ot all the locations for a define type, like armoury_entity?

If your frame rate is really slow using the BSP viewer, just use the Half-Life engine (again, see the Stripper2 ReadMe.txt file since it's explained in there).

"Is there a program that i can run a bsp file trou and get ot all the locations for a define type, like armoury_entity?"

Yes, my BSP tools package contains a program called bsp_tool.exe which will dump the contents of a .bsp file.  See the BSP_tool_ReadMe.txt file for details on how to dump the entities in a map (you want the -ent command line option).

I have the same porblem on iceworld!
I dont get it to strip out the awp!

But if i type status in console, everytime i get to know my point on map with:
x 0, y 0, z 0

On every point of the map!
So i cant strip it out using the amoury_entitie thing!

You will get 0,0,0 if you connect to someone else's server.

If you start your own listen server (Create game->select map), it will show you your X,Y,Z coordinates when you use the 'status' command.

ok now i have the coordinates from the bsp file!
But the irony is that i could add a colt to this point! (ok the colt is not exactly on the awp but nearly)

But i dont get to strip out the awp!

i wrote:

[strip]
armoury_entity (128 -1152 -192)
armoury_entity (640 -182 -192)
[add]
{
   {
      classname/armoury_entity
      origin/128 -1152 -192
      count/1
      item/6
   }
   {
      classname/armoury_entity
      origin/640 -182 -192
      count/1
      item/6
   }
}


am i a noob???
