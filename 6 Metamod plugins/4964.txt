well, I haven't online for such a long time because i have to study my public exam. Since the exam is over, i can now work on the Monster Pluger Expension again. I am working on gonome at this moment, I have to write the code myself. I just added Archer fish a few days ago. The Archer fish code is based on the icthyosaur code and i add a acid attack to Archer fish.

The Monster Plugin Expension will be renamed as "Monster Plugin : Monster Party"
