I have added some friendly little headcrabs into one of my maps with stripper2. They seem to be doing their headcrab job well, but I'm getting this output from the server window: "got a velocity too high on monster_headcrab, got a velocity too low on monster_headcrab"..rinse, lather , repeat  several times..

Now I dont know what velocity is, havent set one, what the hey?

That message is reported by the engine code when something is moving too fast (too high a velocity for the engine to handle accurately) or when a velocity is too low (negative velocity I believe).  The velocity will get clamped by the engine (if it's too high, it gets set to the max, if it's too low, it gets set to zero).

I thought that these messages only appeared when you have developer mode turned on (-dev on the command line) or "developer 1" in your config.cfg file.  Use "developer 0" to turn off these messages.
