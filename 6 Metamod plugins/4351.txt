I have been trying to modify hullu's fakefull metamod plugin to basically make it more botlike. From my limited knowledge of the SDK I am attempting to setthink when the bots spawn, but it is giving me a messed up typecasting error. This is some of what I have:

typedef void (CBaseEntity::*BASEPTR)(void);
BASEPTR      ThinkSet( BASEPTR func, char *name ) 
{ 
      return func;
}
#define SetThink( a ) ThinkSet( static_cast <void (CBaseEntity::*)(void)> (a), #a )

And in my bot spawn:

      SetThink( BotThink );

And my botthink:

void CPlayer::BotThink( void )
{
//WIll put stuff here in awhile
}

However, it is giving me this error:
error C2440: 'static_cast' : cannot convert from '' to 'void (__thiscall CBaseEntity::*)(void)'
        None of the functions with this name in scope match the target type

For the line SetThink( BotThink);

I have added simple bots through the SDK before, with no problems. I am probably missing something simple, but cant get my finger on it. Or maybe I am just using something that isnt compatible with the SDK 2.3, who knows. Anyways if anyone sees a problem with what I am doing and would be kind enough to let me know would be cool :D

The engine will not call a Think() function for fake clients (bots).

If you are creating a normal entity (for example and AI character), the engine will call the Think() function for those, but it WILL NOT call the Think() function for anything with the FL_FAKECLIENT bit set.

The problem with AI entities is that they won't show up on the scoreboard as a normal player would (with frags and deaths, etc.).

Actually, since I am attempting to add this onto hullus fakeplayers plugin, the "fake players" already go into the game, spawn, can be pushed around, etc. etc. However, if you are correct ( and you probably are ) how would I go about adding the ability for the "bots" to move?

Bots move using the pfnRunPlayerMove() engine function.  You pass it the forward move speed and the side move speed (for strafing) and the engine will update the bot's position.

Hmm... so in startframe I could do

if(IsFakePlayer)
{
MoveForwardCrap
}

Something sort of like that.

Look at the StartFrame() code in the HPB bot source.

kk ill take a look. While Im at it, I might as well copy and paste a question I posted on thewavelength forums as well:

--------------------------------------------------

In my serverside addon for bumpercars, I am trying to make it so the view is first person instead of third person. Basically, I need to move the camera down and forward. I can move the camera down using:

pEntity->c.view_ofs.z--;

however when i try view_ofs x or y it doesnt do a thing. Does anyone know another way I can bump the camera forward serverside?

ALSO

I looked at the HPB bot source.. Like I said you do all your moving in BotThink, none of it is in StartFrame... And I can get bots into the game, but for some reason you can walk right through them. I dont know whats up with that. I could make bots move in startframe, but I dont know how to go about looping through all players, checking if they are a bot, then making them move..

Well, I have the Think function intercepted in metamod. This is what I did:

void Think(edict_t *pEntity)
{
      if( pEntity->v.flags == FL_FAKECLIENT )//Its a BOT
      {
            g_engfuncs.pfnRunPlayerMove( pEntity, pEntity->v.v_angle, 450, 450, 0, pEntity->v.button, 0, 1);
      }
      RETURN_META(MRES_HANDLED);
}

But, naturally, it does absolutely nothing. Theres lots wrong, hehehe. Bots can be walked through as if they arent solid, they dont move when they are supposed to :)
