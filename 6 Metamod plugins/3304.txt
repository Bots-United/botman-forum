I'm running TF Server with Monster and have got good feedback from many clients. Great work botman!

I have one question.
At this point, SG guns do not attack monsters and viseversa.
Will this be optimized in the future release?

Tank you.

Nope.  I can't change that since the sentry gun code is part of the MOD and I can't change the MOD code.

Monsters are actually "func_wall" entities in the game.  MODs don't usually attack "func_wall" entities with sentry guns (just "players").  ;D

Too bad it doesn't work with monsters.
I wished SGs would recog me as func_wall...
Thanks for the reply botman! :)
