So in my travels and searches of this forum I've seen lots of talk of oriented sprites and I thought I'd share my experiences. 

Creating an oriented sprite was quite easy, I used sprwiz to create the sprite from a BMP file then used spritemage to change it to oriented. 

I use my sprite on 2fort under TFC and was able (via trial and error) to properly rotate it to place it on the front of each of the 2fort bases...

// LOGO SPRITE       
{
  classname/env_sprite
  frame/1
  framerate/10
  rendermode/5
  renderamt/255
  scale/0.80
  spawnflags/1  // SF_SPRITE_STARTON
  model/sprites/stflogo.spr
  origin/0 -862 -226
  angles/180 90 180
}
// LOGO SPRITE           
{

  frame/1
  framerate/10
  rendermode/5
  renderamt/255
  scale/0.80
  spawnflags/1  // SF_SPRITE_STARTON

}
