I hate having to ask so many questions, but I need more help with stripper2. I've read the whole stripper2 readme but it's not enough, if theres a place someone could point me to that has more info on using it, do that now to shut me up, Otherwise...

K first I'm an idioth and can't get models to spawn (I only play dod) at all, what exactly would I have to do to spawn a xen_tree?

{ 
PRECACHE_MODEL(models/tree.mdl //tree is the actual MODEL name of the xen_tree, correct? (If not I have tried xen_tree too)
      classname/xen_tree //and its class name is this?
      model/models/tree.mdl //I've tried adding this, taking it out etc..
      angle/0
      origin/-418 -3200 -559
} 

What am I doing wrong?! Are there specific more advanced commands I need to spawn it? Like:
renderamt
rendercolor
frame
framerate
scale
spawnflags
If I had a general idea of what these are for and what they do, I might understand which one(s) to use, but then again I'm confused as hell.

Second, I need to know if stripper2 is capable of removing an annoying trigger thingy with [strip] that causes everyones screen to go black for 5+ seconds when someone on my server falls off a ledge to certain death.(I sometimes play Xen maps from hl in dod on my server, this is where it happens) This being a trigger, theres probably a class name for it, right? But so far I haven't seen a very "obvious" thing that would cause this. (I was hoping for player_fade or something easy...)

Thanks for any help, I really like using monster and stripper2 on my server, they make the game much more entertaining!

"xen_tree" entities do not exist in DoD.

Your first step should be to look at some mapping tutorial web sites so that you understand what entities can be added in each MOD (they aren't the same for all MODs).  Since you want DoD, I would search for a DoD mapping tutorial website.

Also download the .fdg file for the MOD you are interested in.  This will give you a list of which entities are allowed in a specific MOD.

Stripper2 can remove entity triggers (those that are spawned from the map file), but not triggers that are generated via the MOD DLL code.  The only way to know the difference is to dump the entities contained within the map .bsp file and see if there are any "trigger_" type entities at the location where you are interested in.  My BSP tools will allow you to dump the entities contained within a map .bsp file.  You can then look up these entities on you mapping tutorial site to determine what they do.

Many of the entities will be common to all MODs (for example "func_wall"), so if you can't find an entity mentioned on a DoD mapping tutorial site, try looking on a general Half-Life mapping tutorial website.  If you dump the entities in all the DoD maps, then you will know which entities are supported by DoD and which are not.  The valid DoD entities will also be contained in the DoD .fgd file (if they don't exist in the DoD .fgd, then they aren't valid entities for DoD).

So basically, if it's not in the notepad file that the entities.exe made (The thing that came with Stripper2) of my dod.dll, it won't work with dod unless its added as a custom model which would then have to be downloaded to anyone who allows it and joins my server?

That is correct.
