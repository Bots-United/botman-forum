I think I had tried that before and it worked fine.  Just create a "func_ladder" and set the bounding box size.  The width should probably be between 32 and 64 units.  It should be about 4 units thick and it should be however high you want it to go.

The biggest problem is that there won't be a texture (it will be an invisible ladder).  If you look at any Half-Life mapping tutorial that talks about ladders, you'll see why (because a ladder in Half-Life is actually a func_ladder and a texture applied to a wall behind it or applied to a func_wall drawn slightly behind the func_ladder).

You SEE the ladder texture, but you can't climb it.  You can't see the func_ladder, but you can climb it.  You have to have both to have a ladder that you can see that you can also climb.

That's why stripping out "func_ladder" in a map is so much fun, because the ladder texture is still there and people think you can climb it, but you CAN'T!  ;D ha-ha!

If I remember right, it's something like this...
code:
{
   classname/func_ladder
   origin/-550 240 -1640
   bbox_min/-20 -2 0
   bbox_max/20 2 200
}

...give that a whirl and see if that works.

it diddnt work..  but if i read what you previous post said.. its the func ladder acually supposed to be behind the wall itself? if so, am i supposed to set the location just behind the wall?

ok, i used bsp tool, and went to the base point where the ladder would start.. ground level... and got the xyz cords...   diddnt work..  moved in 10 points closer to the wall..   nada....

For finding ladder bases, try using bspc to decompile the map.
Load it into your favorite editor and then place a ladder where you want it.
Then, steal the coords of the ladder and add it to your stripper config file.

I used to suggest taht all the time, but I've found its pointless. Most people don't seem to know map editors, let alone how to make a ladder in one and don't bother with it.
