I came up with this idea, but I'm not able to do it my self.. It shouldn't be to hard if you've got a little bit more programming skill than I do.. But anyway, here's the thing:

The .map format code is like this (for adding an item):
{
"classname" "ammo_buckshot"
"angles" "0 180 0"
"origin" "-808 -32 208"
}

and the Stripper2 code is like this:
{
classname/ammo_buckshot
angle/180
origin/-808 -32 208
}

Could someone maybe create a program that converts the first code to the 2nd?... It would ease up the work a bunch... Or if you (botman) could enable the .map format in Stripper2. Either would be nice..

It's not that it's hard to get it working, but it feels like a lot of wasted time if it could be made easier.

(I'm working in Worldcr... erhm, Valve Hammer with addin, as well with removing, weapons and stuff and copy the code from the .map file)

Because adding a new item is really easy, the newest item is always att the bottom of the .map file (viewed in a text editor), so it's pretty much just copy & paste, what takes time is the removing of all """"..

If you just think it's a stupid idea and it'd take more time to make such a program then to edit the code than I'll just shut up, but it might get really appreciated (spelling police) by the "stripper2-community" ;) I know i would.

You could do this pretty easily in Linux using sed.  Something like this would work (I think)...
code:
sed 's/\"{.*}\" \"{.*}\"/\0\/\1/' *.txt

...all you have to do is install Linux on your machine and run the .txt files through sed.  ;)

P.S. You could also just use Windows text editor that supports regular expressions (like EditPad or UltraEdit for example).

Ripent uses .map format. Ripent comes with zoners, you can grab that at almost any mapping site.

I've been playing around & if i can do what your talking about, i'll add it. No promises. I'm a total noob..

Here's a screenshot of it so far - http://grubber.hypermart.net/pics/bsp_tool%20editor.jpg

Here's how the program works so far,
1st you click 'Create Map List'. That'll give a list off ALL your bsp, "grubber.hypermart.net/pics/maps.jpgExample. Click 'View Maps List' & just double click on maps name. That's now in clipboard! Now that you have the maps name in clipboard, You can now use the 'Command Line Arguements' on the map. With just 1 click on each in the box it will make the .txt.. You can go right down the list.. Go back to 'View Maps List' & choose another & you can send it through the list agian..

I'm surprised no one thought of this =)

When editing in Notepad:

Go to Replace find "" replace with: /
Then replace " with:
