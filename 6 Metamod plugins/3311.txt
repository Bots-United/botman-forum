for some reason, the controller monster doesn't seem to change its hit points in response to the cfg file.  The other monsters do, e.g. 500hp zombies.  (takes down the awp campers a notch) I need a plugin to drop a few snarks on campers, heh.

is there an upper limit value for monster hp?

otherwise, this plugin is great!

Do you mean health?  There's no "hit points" in the monster_skill.cfg file.

You need to copy the monster_skill.cfg file to the MOD directory (i.e. valve\monster_skill.cfg, tfc\monster_skill.cfg, cstrike\monster_skill.cfg, etc.), then modify that monster_skill.cfg file and change the health of the monster before starting the server.

hp, hit points, health, etc.  I can't get out of the dungeons and dragons way of thinking.  

Anyway, I am able to change the health for all of the other monsters.  But the controller doesn't seem to be affected.  It can be killed with a few shots.  I set the health to 600.  

e.g.

// Controller (controller)
sk_controller_health  600
sk_controller_dmgzap  25
sk_controller_speedball  800
sk_controller_dmgball  4


this doesn't seem to allow the controller to take 600 points of damage.  This is a (linux) CT server.  the monster_skill.cfg file is in the /cstrike folder.  I believe the rest of the monsters' health is functioning correctly.  Just wondered if there was a limit to the "sk_controller_health" value? 

thanks

How easily it's killed will depend on the weapon you use to kill it.  Some MODs have weapons that do 1000 units of damage per hit (to insure instant death for each shot).  There is effectively no limit to the health.  You could set it to a million if you wanted to.  Try killing it with other weapons (like a pistol) and see how many shots it takes to kill it.  Double the health, restart the server and try killing it with the same weapon.  It should take roughly twice as many shots to kill it.
