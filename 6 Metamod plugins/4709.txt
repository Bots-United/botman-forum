My mod crashes cstrike.exe, not the server but the client. How is this possible? It seems to occur either when joing a game or when leaving.
Very strange. Has somebody experienced this ??

Need more info, what plugins are you using, and what have you wrote in their configs which differ from the default settings?

Its my own mod, a match automation mod for tournament and such. It does authentication, team sorting, referee functions and such.

I prevent users from changing teams and changing their names but other then that I dont write anything to the configs.

So it's a coding thing?

Do you do anything with ClientConnect / ClientPutInServer/ClientDisconnect functions?
