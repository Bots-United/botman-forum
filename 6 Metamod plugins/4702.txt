I stripped func_water from Undertow, but the only water to disappear was the pool in the big room. All the running water is still there (and it's impossible to move against it in the places you normally can).

Any ideas? I'm missing something here...

trigger_push is what pushes you not the water.

The running water is probably an animated texture on the brush (which you can't remove).

The sound is probably an env_sound entity (which you can remove).

ambient_generic is my guess

Simple, the moving water is a func_conveyor if i remember correctly. Strip those out and youre good to go, only problem being that youll also remove the other conveyors in the map.

Maybe you can strip all func_conveyers (there is such a thing eh?) and add them back in.
