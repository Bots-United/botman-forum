First I didn't know what section of the forum this topic belongs to. 

I want to know if it's possible to have metamod while having Botmixer.How is it possible when my liblist.gam already has metamod.dll

Have you tried...
code:
+localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/botmixer5000.dll

...at the end of your command line?  I'm not sure if this will work or not, plus several people have stated that BotMixer5000 won't work with the Half-Life 1.1.0.9 update.  I'll try to take a look at getting BoxMixer5000 working with the 1.1.0.9 engine in a few days.

botman

Botmixer will work with the new update. Only problem I am having is to have both stripper2 and bot working at the same time. I am currently trying your last suggestion and will write as soon as I find anything out.

Ok, I have tryed the linux command for localhost but to no avail. Unless I am over looking something it looks as though it is bots or stripper, not both. Either way, I want to commend you on the fine work botman. Both of thse work great. Just not together at the time being(probably something stupid on my part.)
