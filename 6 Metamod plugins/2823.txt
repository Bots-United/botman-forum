I've seen examples of other peoples configs on this board for lighting and adding chickens, but where are they getting the .spr and the .mdl files for these objects? 
thanks

You can create .mdl and .spr files yourself, but in most cases people are using the .mdl or .spr files included with the MOD.  Look for a pak0.pak file since the models and sprites might be embedded in there (use PakExplorer to find out).

Also note that most people posting in the Stripper2 thread DON'T mention what MOD they are working with (they just ASSUME that everyone knows what MOD they are playing around with).  You HAVE to know which entities are valid for the MOD you are using since you can't just create things in any old MOD if the MOD doesn't support that entity.  That's why I created the "entities.exe" application so you could find out what entities are valid for the MOD you are playing with (see the ReadMe.txt file in the Stripper2 zip file for more details).
