If I change the sky box in a map the client already has, and the sky box is a standard one, the client will not have to download anything extra at all correct? They will just connect like normal and enter the game as quick as always. I will have renamed the bsp file of course.

If the client would have to download a custom skybox, what would a typical sky box file size be? I would not want them to wait an extended period of time.

There are 2 different skybox image types, bitmap (.bmp) and Targa (.tga).  The bitmap format is lower quality (only 8 bit color), but the size is also smaller.

The engine will try to load the Targa format if it exists and then will try to load the bitmap format.

In the valve\pak0.pak file, you can look in the gfx\env folder for the skybox faces.  There are 6 images required for a complete skybox.  The bitmap files are about 64K and the Targa versions of the same image are about 192K.  So, 6 bitmap images would be about 384K per skybox and the Targa images would be about 1.152MB per skybox.

Some can be huge (several gigs).  Go to this site and link to Env Maps for Half-life.
