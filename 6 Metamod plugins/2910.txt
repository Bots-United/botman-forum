i am trying to add ammo into tfc, i tried to add grenades, but they bounced.i also tried to add a rpg, i ended up making the picture of one float, i couldn't pick up either.Do i have to put them in some sort of back pack, if so what is the code for a backpack?
Also what type of ammo does the sniper rifle use, and what is the code to add it?

Thank You For Your Help

they have to be a info_tfgoal...

{
classname/info_tfgoal
g_a/1 //Have to look in wc to figure out what this means.
g_e/1 //^
mdl/models/backpack.mdl //Model to use
wait/5 //Time to wait before respawn
ammo_shells/50 //Shotgun ammo, ac ammo, sg ammo...
ammo_cells/50 //Pyro flammer ammo/sg build ammo
ammo_rockets/20 //Pyro, solly, and sg rockets
ammo_nails/50 //Nails
team_no/2 //Team that can use it
noise/weapons/scock1.wav //Sound made on pick up
ammo_medikit/20 //I cant remember what this does, I'll have to look in worldcraft if you want to know...
angles/0 0 0 //Direction it faces, X Y Z
goal_state/2 //Active (1)/Inactive(2)
origin/808 3840 -670 //Loaction in map
}

For model you can use any model you like

P.S. You should be able to use any model you want for the "model" key (not just restricted to backpacks).  So, for example, if you wanted a backpack that only contained grenades, why not simply use the grenade model to make it display as grenades?

in my tfc/models folder in doesn't have backpack.mdl, or ambience/biggun1.wav. are they in the pak file?

there is only:

wtfpack.mdl (?)
demopack.mdl (detpack i presume)
alertpack.mdl (?)

"backpack.mdl" is inside the pak0.pak file in the TFC directory.  Download PakExplorer to view the contents of pak files (use www.google.com to search for PakExplorer).

"biggun1.wav" comes from the valve\pak0.pak file.  MODs can use models, sounds and sprites from the valve\pak0.pak file in addition to models, sounds, or sprites found in the MODs pak file or folders.

wtfpack.mdl and alertpack.mdl are custom models from the game development clan [WTF?]. Maps like mya, villa, nexus(1,2,3,4) etc all come from that crew and use that set of models in their maps. If you decide to use those models you will need to force other clients to download them with a res file.
