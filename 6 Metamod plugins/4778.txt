Hello,

I have got a problem with sprites adding to a cs server with the plugin stripper2.

Everything go's allright with adding the sprite to the map, but the sprite is always fucked up. 

This first link shows how it's supposed to be
http://obl.crew-nexus.net/Images/obl1.bmp

This link shows the banner at the server.
http://obl.crew-nexus.net/Images/de_dust20000.jpg

It just looks like a negative of the sprite had been made

below you can see the lines in the de_dust2_str.cfg

==========================================
[add]

// Add the banner 
{
   classname/env_sprite
   PRECACHE_SPRITE(sprites/obl1.spr)
   frame/1
   framerate/10
   rendermode/5
   renderamt/255
   scale/0.80
   spawnflags/1  // SF_SPRITE_STARTON
   model/sprites/obl1.spr
   origin/ 333 -830 289
}

==========================================

What am i doing wrong, I really dont get it

grtz Vyp

Don't use an ALPHA_test sprite when you create the sprite file.  (how to change it depends on what tool you use to create the sprite, see the docs that come with the tool or look for options to change "Alpha_test" to something else.

I am using the sprite maker program "SprWiz" from Wavelength and chose as sprite:

"normal - 256 colors; no blending or transparancy"

Here is my sprite:

Off the topic, but thanks botman for continuing to keep this forum current with your insights and help, despite the fact that you've moved on to bigger and better projects.  There aren't many that would bother.

You're welcome.

I like to visit the forum while I'm recompiling the project I'm currently working on at Gearbox (which is TOP SECRET, so I can't tell anything about it).

It takes about 7 to 10 minutes to rebuild the entire project and that's just enough time for me to visit a couple of forums, read through the messages and reply to a few of them.

Just hope that Microsoft doesn't come out with a faster compiler!  :D
