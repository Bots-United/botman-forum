Is there any way to set more than one spawn flag for an entity?

Yes, depending on the entity you can add them up but you can't use spawnflags that are in conflict.

Here is an example using ambient generic:

// ALIEN ALERT SOUND 
{ 
      targetname/sound_alien1 
      classname/ambient_generic 
      spawnflags/49      //play everywhere(1), not looped(32), start silent(16) 
      message/vox/alien.wav 
      health/10                        // volume (1-10) 
      origin/-943 423 200 
}

Thanks des notes.

It's funny your should use ambient_generic as your example becuase that's exactly what I'm playing around with. I'm trying to set it up so when players join my server a wav file is played. I have only had partial success and would really appreciate it if someone could steer me in the right direction.

Here's what's happening, the first person joins, the wav is played but it loops even though I tell it not to. Then my HPB bot joins, ending the wav. When I make a second bot join, the wav plays and doesn't end until someone else joins. Rinse, lather, repeat. 

I'm adding targetname/game_playerjoin to the ambient_generic to produce the effect. Maybe there is some entity that would end the wav after it's played and allow another one to be triggered? I have the spawnflags set to 17 and have tried every combo possible but nothing keeps it from repeating.

... it would probably be best to use an AdminMod plugin for this. http://imu.recongamer.com has one that I helped em write that does the exact thing you're asking for (atleast I think its the one I helped em write... lol). Ask them :)

If I still had a copy I'd post it for you...

I agree that the AdminMod plugin would be better but it sounds like you are toggling when you trigger the sounds...post the ambient_generic and the trigger you are using and I will take a look at it.

Lunatic, I emailed them about it. Haven't heard back from them yet.

Des notes, I have tried a number of things, but here is what I'm working with now just to give you a starting point. And I do appreciate you taking a look. It is something I really want to do for my server and it's slowly driving me batty. :)

{
classname/ambient_generic
spawnflags/17
health/10
pitch/100
pitchstart/100
message/ambience/flies.wav
targetname/game_playerjoin
target/mult1
}
{
classname/multi_manager
killtarget/game_playerjoin
delay/9   //give enough time for it to play
targetname/mult1
}

I think the place to start is finding something that shuts the #@@$!&! thing off after its played. Spawnflags isn't the place to look cause I've tried em all.

About an AdminMod plugin, I got on Malchie Bros Backyard BBQ ( nice server), and I know when you exit, and I think when you leave also a wav file is played. The exit one says, "Please come again!" in a funny voice.

Unfortunately I have no way of contacting the admin there.

The spawnflags for "ambient_generic" are...

-1 : "Default"
0  : "Everywhere"
200 : "Small Radius"
125 : "Medium Radius"
80  : "Large Radius"

...so your spawn flags of 17 doesn't do anything.

Looking at the code in "ambient_generic", it sets up a ToggleUse() function (which means each time this entity gets used it toggles on or off).  There's no way to change this behaviour (ambient_generic will ALWAYS toggle on and off no matter what the spawnflags are).

Brue that Please Come Again is Apu from the Simpsons and its a AdminMOd plugin that you can grab from www.adminmod.org/ascript/

botman is right...plus there is no killtarget in a multi_manager but you can try calling the ambient_generic again after the time it would take to play

classname/multi_manager 
targetname/playerjoin_mm 
game_playerjoin/0   // Play it
game_playerjoin/3   //Stop it

Ok thanks guys.
Lunatic, I have looked through that admin mod plugin list several times and couldn't find anything like what I wanted. I posted there and was told to download a certain plugin, which I did and it only displayed text. When I mentioned this, I was told I was being "picky". It's like going to buy a Led Zeppelin cd only to be handed a book about Led Zeppelin. I've gotten spoiled over here on this forum. Botman has never failed to seek an answer for me and most of the time he does.

BTW is it just me or is it like convicts night out or something? I have run into more assholes today than a looong time. Assholes on my server, banned my first ever and almost a second, ppl on other forums jumping on me for no reason and the admins wont offer help, somebody keeps calling me and hanging up...I'm thinking about getting back in bed. Well I'm rambling. :) Thanks again guys for your input; I will try what Mike said and keep digging.

It is contained in this plugin: 

35. Play custom wav files when a user says a keyword. (comeagain.wav is included)

Bill I was hopeful when I read your post. I installed the plugin, and although it will play an exit message, it will not play any message at all when you join! It allows for that, but no matter what you put in, it will not play it. (I even put the comeagain.wav in there and some of the other wavs that come with the program. I put the joinwav I want played in the spot for exiting the game, and it worked perfectly. I don't understand why this part of the program doesn't work.

You would know the one feature I want in this plugin is the one feature that doesn't work. 

The only thing I can figure is that since the program relies on keystrokes to activate the wav files, when you join the game you are 1) using your mouse, and 2) not in the game yet.

Here is the format of the cfg file:
SND_JOIN;      misc\thispartwontwork.wav
SND_EXIT;      misc\comeagain.wav

Have you tried it when you were in the game and another player entered?  I believe, but I am not certain, that the players on the server hear enter the sound, but the entering player doesn't.

The iMu plugin plays a sound that only the joiners hear... try harder to get in contact with them :)

Bill, I have not tried it with actual players, only HPB bots. When they exit the game, the exit wav is played, so I would assume the same would be true for entering, but I will test it with real peeps just to be sure.

It does play the wav when real players join, exit wav works for bots also. But the join wav I want is looped unfortunately. I'm going to try a few things. I'm halfway there anyhow. Thanks for the tip, Bill.

But wouldn't I have to do that manually everytime?
I'm looking for something that will do it automatically. But I will try that in the meantime. Thanks.

No matter what i do the wav file loops.
I have tried everything I can think of.
I am going to just add the sound at every map change.

Some .wav files have the loop bit set internally in the file.  Try using another .wav file that doesn't have the loop bit set.

Well I was wanting a particular wav file that is perfect for the theme of my server. I am just going to add it to the end of every map so the players hear it as they look at the final scores.

Well I am happy to report that after almost TWO FREAKING MONTHS of trying I FINALLY figured out a way to do what I want!!!

It was deceptively simple, and I appreciate the help of everyone who contributed to this thread. Your ideas helped me work out the problem.

The sounds must be 8 bit mono, if they are stereo they will loop, use a good wav editor to fix them up.
