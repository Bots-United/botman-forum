i got a question about the loader.mdl  for anyone...plz
 i've read the other post about how to add it in , but when someone ask about it , it seemd to get skipped and something else is talked about. anyway, how would you add in the loader.mdl ? and what are all the lines that have to be add into the .cfg file ?

That depends on what you want to use the loader for.

If you just want a model displayed in the game, there's a variety of entities you can use (monster_furniture is probably the best).

Some entities will not be solid, so if you spawn an entity and use loader.mdl as the "model" key, players would be able to walk through it (which might be what you want in some instances).  monster_furniture will be solid (but you'll need to specify the min and max bounding box (set the crossfire_str.cfg example for the teleporter entity).

Not all MODs will support the monster_furniture entity so you may have to try some other entities if monster_furniture doesn't spawn anything (see some mapping tutorials for that MODs to determine if monster_furniture is supported or not).

thanks botman for  your reply....    the MOD is TFC. the map is well.bsp, and yes i want it solid. (only on blue's side)i'm going to make the loader start on the left sdie near the tunnel in the middle. it will have 3 stopping points. turn around and go to blues bridge and cross over it and turn right and go to the wall. (left side before the water if your coming out the door.) What i'm not sure about is, will the loader start over at point A  or just stop and stand there with the crate ? what will it do ?  i think i know why it's not loading in to the game, i just don't know everything that should be in there  ex:

well_str.cfg

i used a entity called a cycler that spawned the loader and it would run a quick little movement demo.. but you could walk thru it.. not what your looking for, but its kinda nice to run on apaches sitting on the ground, becase the roters spin.. just toss in an ambient_generic apache rotor wave and you got an idling chopper.

In what i pasted above, is that right? i found that  here:   

   http://www.karljones.com/halflife/almanac.asp
 
 ( Then click Misc "under the  HALF-LIFE ENTITES on the left side",and scroll down to the cycler and click on monster_Generic.it's in the tutorial.)

  and

http://www.planethalflife.com/Workshop/tutorials/mon_generic.asp


 Download the example.map  at the bottom of the page on the 2nd link. thats what i used.it can be viewed with wordpad.
