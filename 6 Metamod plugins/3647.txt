I have tweaked out my own mod with the old neotf sourcecode, ive been trying to figure out how to add weapons from hl and any other hl mods into this tfc based server side mod, it uses borland to compile instead of MSVS C++ which hl uses, the coding from both seem similar, im just not sure on going about adding it as an include into my build. If anyone has a clue about how to go about this , plz respond with some helpful info, any help would be greatly appreciated and i will try to compensate for any help that is useful.
