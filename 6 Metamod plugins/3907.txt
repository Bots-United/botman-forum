You can only remove weapons from a map if they are SPAWNED into the map when the map loads.  If you don't see a weapon lying on the ground waiting to be picked up, Stripper2 can't remove it.

This is true for any MOD (deathmatch, TFC, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, etc.).  Any MOD where the Game DLL code "gives" a weapon to a player (at player spawn time or by purchasing the weapon) you will NOT be able to strip the weapon out of the map using Stripper2.

what i dont get is that if i have to add the coordinates of where i want every entity added.. becasue that could be very time consuming to get all the coordinates of where u want the entites and maybe can u be able to add a little download section where people can add there .cfg files for maps they add entities for?

I'd suggest "reading"

[strip]
env_sprite

That will get rid of your sprites, adding/removing health and ammo bags would probably take an hour per map.

Ammo, armor, and health packs are info_tfgoal, item_armor and item_healthpack. Go from there to a mapping help site.

your asking alot to have someone do it for you.. it time consuming, and not really that hard.. its just alot of writing down xyz cordinates..... (i have a notebook full of notes from all my maps)


ill share all my configs with anyone who wants to use them, but creating them is something i dont have the time for....

read the configs, and use botmans bsp tools.. thats all you really need... read the readme, and use these forums for help.. botman, and lunatic are really good at responding within 2 hours of a post... i even hop in when its somthing i know..

its a good forum for advice... at least this isnt the foxbot forum... (with all do respect to jordan and redfox who arereally nice...)  least you annoy their forms anal retentive immature nazi "clicker" ...

yea ill start making the configs and clicker indeed is really eh, mean.. i cant even ask something without him saying im a n00b.
Even though i probably am but how should i kno why my bots only use crowbars.. (i have bot shooting enabled) But of  course i fixed that BY MYSELF

I can never see why so many forum idlers are such bastards when it comes to being helpful. Why the hell do you bother responding if you're not going to say something constructive?

So anyways, how about them Vikings? :P

Jordan made a post about needing out help with the new bots..  and people were offering there servers.. so i offerd my tfc/neo-tf server.. and Dickler, er, clicker jumped my crap....  so i complaind to jordan about what hes doing.. and he agreed with me, that part of the problem is hes a kid, and second he had no forum guidelines.. so he said he was going to get some set...

i hate that clicker faggot. in the NeoTF forum i said that my bots dont shoot because people dont like shooting bots and i said that it's impossible to kill a hw bot, which it is. then that clicker faggot comes in saying "oh you're just a n00b" saying that i sucked and everything so i post links of how i'm top in stats
http://shawnserver.cjb.net/psychostats_tfc/index.php (chemrok is my friend and was playing on my computer, that's really me)

clicker insists that he's good at TFC yet he never came to my server to prove it so i went to his server to find how good he was at 'owning' these bots and i find out he's a spy! well no wonder he can kill hw bots, he's a fag spy who doesn't get shot at by bots! i told him to pool HLStats with me (all he had to do was set his logaddress to my IP and port) yet he insisted that he not.. i guess he's just too much of a n00b.

He's using Psychostats. 

And I beg to differ, I can take down an HWGuy bot :). They can be taken down, it just depends on how you approach them. And what tactic you use. A demoman can kill any class within a few seconds when you use the right combination of frag + pipe or frag + gl or whatever. Its the only class that can put out enough damage in one hit to kill any class (Although HWGuy is harder, usualy I can take down a heavy with 2 frags and a pipe).

It has nothing to do with being a noob, its all about how you approach things. Diffrent classes are good for things at diffrent ranges: EG an hwguy (no matter if they're a bot or not) is weak at long range due to their weapon spreads.
