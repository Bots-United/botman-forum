is there any way to write a script that would load the str file. 
 An idea have a map vote for a stripper2 ver or a regular version of a map. I know it would have to be loaded before the map is to change. BUT is this possable ?

No, I don't think so.  To the best of my knowledge, there aren't any entites that accept user input, so you couldn't display a menu on the client and have people vote on it because there's no where to send the responses.

You might be able to hack together some system where people would walk up to some object and USE it to vote, but you'd have to have a complex system of multimanagers to keep track of how many USEs each entity received and you'd have to have some way of keeping people from voting more than once.  The only method of "output" would be to send some text message to the log file and you'd have to open the log file to parse it when the server was going to change maps.

In short, you can't do what you want with Stripper2.  You need a dedicated plugin for metamod that supports voting.

oh yes i understand that, and thats not the problem. I can get a plugin for the voting process. i mean once the vote have been done and say they wanted the strpper verion. err.
let say the str file is for well.bsp (well_str.cfg)If i didn't want the str file running i would name the file (well_str1.cfg)
 Could there be a script that could change the  (well_str1.cfg)  to  (well_str.cfg) before the map change ?

Yes, a batch file could copy a numbered config file to a non-numbered format (i.e. "copy map_1.cfg o map.cfg" or "copy map_2.cfg to map.cfg") and the plugin would load the non-numbered one.

The problem is getting some kind of output from the voting plugin to run the external batch file that copies/renames the files.

There aren't any plugins that I'm aware of that would do this (rename and/or copy files).  You might be able to do this with an AdminMOD AMX plugin since it's easier to script things and one of the things their scripting system probably supports is the ability to spawn/run external programs (or batch files).

Ask on the AdminMOD forum how you would run an external application based on feedback from a voting system.

I put together a AdminMod plugin that changed stripper config files during map change. If I had set up 3 different crossfire stripper files, the plugin would delete the crossfire_str.cfg file and copy the crossfire_str1.cfg to crossfire_str.cfg. 

If you are interested I can post or send you the source.
