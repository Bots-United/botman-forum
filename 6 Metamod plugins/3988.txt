i havent run monster mod in a bit, and i tried to reinstall it, and it does work, but, im having some problems now...  for a map i spent HOURS plotting out monster spawn points, it seems now they are now half way down into the floor now.. and act real diffrent.. basically i just put the line back into the metamod.ini/plugin.ini to restart it...  its not set up in the new adminmod way, would this have something to do with it.. im running these metamod plugins

adminmod
foxbot
stripper2
neotf
hlguard
statsme

ok, ill try to explain it..  a while back i disabled MM...  and i installed a fresh copy of hlds..  i decided to reinstall MM, and after i did, i acts weird.. i cant spawn monsters, it says nothing is precached..  the monsters in my rock2 prefap config are off in xyz cordinates... alot of them are stuck in the floors half way down....

I would suggest going back and double checking the spawn coordinates.  I don't know why these would be different unless the maps changed from the version that you had originally.

It shouldn't take too long to create a listenserver with that map and verify that the coordinate is what you think it should be.

even your prefab monster config of crossover2 is doing the same thing with hgrunts, there sitting waist deep in the gound on my server..  

for now im just using it to spawn monsters manually....   but id really like to figure this one out.

put AdminMod on the server then try teleporting yourself into some of the coordinates to see whether the coordinates are placed weird or if it's the plugin acting weird.

The only other weirdness that I can think of is that somehow you got a bunch of modified monsters with funky origins in the model.

Player origins are normally at the center of the body.  Monster origins (including scientist and human grunts) are normally at the feet.  When a monster is spawned, the engine drops that model down to the ground (i.e. the origin is lowered until it touches the ground).  If the origin of your monsters is somewhere in the middle of the body, then half of the monster will be below the ground.

Check to make sure you don't have any monster models in the 'valve\models' folder (since all of the monster models should only be in the .pak file.
