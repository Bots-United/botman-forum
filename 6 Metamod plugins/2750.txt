I tried to find a good reference for spawning weapons.  I wasn't able to place weapons on the map using classname/weapon_awp.  I had to use classname/armour_entity then an item number.  If anybody know how to get around this that would be great.  When useing the classname/weapon_awp it pretends to work in the logs but the weapons aren't in the game.

for the classname/armour_entity here are the item numbers.  I couldn't find a reference to this so I will post it for you.

item/0  = mp5
item/1  = tmp
item/2  = p90
item/3  = mac10
item/4  = ak47
item/5  = sig
item/6  = colt
item/7  = aug
item/8  = scout
item/9  = g3
item/10 = awp
item/11 = m3pump
item/12 = auto shotty
item/13 = para
item/14 = flash grenade
item/15 = he grenade
item/16 = armor
item/17 = armor  

Not sure which armor has the helmet.  I wasn't able to find the missing weapons like all pistols and sig sniper.

I used syntax like this to add the entity
{
        classname/armoury_entity
        angle/0
        item/4
        origin/140 -1492 -298
}

i found something similar on this website:

http://www.uselessgaming.com/trick-32pep-secret.php

listing what items give what weapons...

there is a helpfull key that can be used to spawn multiple weapons of the same type in the same place.

just add:

count/x

where x is the number of items you want to spawn.

i tried spawning 20 HE Grenades on the floor in de_dust... it seemed to work OK when i was alone on the server... but when a friend joined in, not all of the grenades where spawning... sometimes it would only spawn 1, sometimes it would spawn 4 or 5... strange stuff, i guess it has something to do with there only being allowed to have 1024 entities on a map (from the url above).

Hi

i even tried to spawn weapons in CS
unfortunately the link above is dead

i cant find a way to spawn pistols
after a look in the fgd, im not sure that is is possible at all
it seems as if pistols can only spawn together with a player

if someone knows the classname for the pistols,nightvision,defusekit...
or a tutorial to spawn pistols, please please post it

ps: item/19 is for smoke grenade; i tried nubers up to 25, but only kevlar vest spawned all the time

Use the "Search" feature to search for "add weapon counter strike"...
