can things like buttons and decals/sprays not be spawned on some walls? Will they not show up at all on certain coords?
heres what i have:
{
   classname/func_wall
   model/*24
   origin/-445 614 -1760
}
this wont work....and i know these are wall corrds b/c i used other coords from the demo as a test.

Brush models are OFFSET from the original origin.  If you are trying to place a brush model (model=*number) at an origin (-445, 614, -1760) you will need to find the origin of the original brush model (*24 in this case) and SUBTRACT the origin of where you want the clone from the origin of the original.

For example, if *24 is located at (100, 50, -180) and I wanted to place a copy at (200, 10, 40), the origin of the func_wall would be (100, -40, 220) and not (200, 10, 40).

The brush model is being placed somewhere where you can't see if (or somewhere that you don't expect it to be).

how do you know which button is which model number?....and when trying to find the origin of the button, do u use no clip and go just inside the button to get its origin? ...i tried using you entity grabber and it doesnt have origins for the buttons  :(

You need to use the BSP tools to dump the entities contained in a map .bsp file.  The ReadMe.txt file included with Stripper2 explains how to do this (did you read it?).

The dump of entities from bsp_tool will have the min and max coordinates of the brush model (model=*number).  You take the average of the min and max values to determine the origin (again, all this is clearly explained in the ReadMe.txt file).
