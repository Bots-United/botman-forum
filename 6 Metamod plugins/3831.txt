Hello!

I'm trying to compile the stub_mm plugin, with any changes to the code. But I'm getting this error for dllapi.cpp, h_export.cpp and meta_api.cpp:

c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vc98\mfc\include\afxv_w32.h(14) : fatal error C1189: #error :  WINDOWS.H already included.  MFC apps must not #include <windows.h>

Anyone knows what I need to do to fix it?

PS1: When I compile botman's monster plugin, it does not happen. and as fas as I've checked, my code is exactly the same as botmans's up to the point where it calls windows.h

PS2: I'm an experienced programmer and already sucessfully used the HL SDK before.

You have to make sure you have the SDK installed in the proper place for metamod.

The problem you are running into is that metamod is including "util.h" from the Microsoft include path and not from the SDK include path.

Install the SDK inside the metamod folder.  Look at the .dsw file in a text editor to see what the expected include path for the Half-Life SDK is as far as metamod is concerned.

I didn't like the fact that metamod didn't include the files that it needed from the SDK as part of the metamod files, so I created my own version of the engine, common, and dlls include files with my metamod plugins so that people would not need to install the Half-Life SDK inside the metamod folder.

Yeah, you're right! That was it!

Why can't everybody else be as clear as you?
I think I browsed around 10 topics on several boards with people having exactly the same problem as me but nobody could explain how they fixed it.
I did as you, just copid the files needed from SDK into my plugin source file structure.

I think Metamod don't have these files included because the SDK sometimes gets updated, then it's better to grab them from the latest version. If that's their point, I must agree with them.

But they should update their coding page, it took me a whole day just to understand what, where and  how I needed to compile the plugin.

Thanks, man!

"Why can't everybody else be as clear as you?"

I don't know.  I only know the answers because I've had the exact same problems.  I'm too stubborn to give up when I run into a problem.  ;D

I think Will Day (the metamod author), didn't want to get in any trouble for redistributing the SDK with his code, so he requires people to install the SDK on their own.  I would be helpful if he explained on the metamod site exactly what was needed to build metamod, but at least you know what to do now and can answer this question if it comes up anywhere else.
