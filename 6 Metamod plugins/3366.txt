Are the scientist monsters supposed to add health to players?  If so, is there a setting in the config file that needs to turn this on?

The scientists aren't very good at adding health.  The player must have less than 1/2 of his max health (usually max health is 100 but MODs can change this) before the scientist will attempt to heal the player.  Also scientists cannot be scared by anything else nearby (like aliens or military grunts).

If you stand there in front of a non-scared scientist with less than half your max health, for about 20 or 30 seconds, the scientist should eventually notice you, pull out the hypodermic and give you a shot to increase your health.  They will add the amount of health configured in the monster_skill.cfg file (sk_scientist_heal).

I see.  I guess I was being a little impatient.  I'll try standing around for a while.

thanks
