Which part of the ReadMe.txt that comes with the Monster plugin can you not figure out?  Be more specific.

in your liblist game file put this
(this is my liblist from my tfc server)

// Team Fortress Classes Game .dll Listing File
// Load order is determined by file order.
game "Team Fortress"
url_info "www.teamfortressclassic.com"
url_dl ""
version "1.5"
size "37000000"
svonly "0"
Secure "1" 
cldll "0"
type "multiplayer_only"
nomodels "1"  // Don't show models in browser, since you don't pick them there anyway.
mpentity "info_tfdetect"
gamedll "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod.dll"


then you put metamod in a folder called 

addons



so metamod would be in this folder

hlserver/tfc/addons/metamod

inside the metamod are two items, a folder, and an ini file called plugins

put this line in the plugins.ini file

win32 addons/metamod/dlls/monster_mm.dll

the the other item in the metamod folder is your dll folder, thats where the metamod.dll and the monster.dll  is in my folder..


if my memory serves me right this should do it..


you will have to read the readme for monstermod to get it to run..

just put the monster precache and monster skill in the mod director.. like tfc/cs

and in the maps folder put the map monster configs if you plan to have them spawn automatically..
