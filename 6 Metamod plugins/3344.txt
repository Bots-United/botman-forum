I'm not sure if this is a fluke in the HL code or the way Stripper2 evaluates the properties but I noticed that 2 properties for calling monsters require exact case or they are not recognized. The two are:

TriggerCondition
TriggerTarget

It wasn't until I reviewed my Stripper2 logs that I noticed the two properties were giving me a warning...once I changed the case to the above format, they worked.

Just a heads up for anyone creationg the map config files for Stripper2.

Yes, all key/value pairs for entities are CaSe SeNsItIvE.  If you don't use the same CASE as shown in the .fgd file, the MOD DLL code will spit out a warning message about invalid key/value names.
