a very small number of people who try to connect to my server can't join because they cannot download my custom sprite, while everyone else can. they get a message similar to this:
"cannot continue without model sprites/fnd1.spr server disconnected"

is there any setting on the client side thats preventing downloads, and also, is there any way to make it so they can still join even if they don't have the sprite? 

this is my stripper2 config:

[add]
{
   classname/env_sprite
   PRECACHE_SPRITE(sprites/fnd1.spr)
   frame/1
   framerate/10
   renderfx/0
   rendermode/1
   renderamt/255
   scale/1
   spawnflags/1
   model/sprites/fnd1.spr
   origin/1406 388 135
   angles/180 90 180
}

btw its a counter-strike server

make shure you have a .res file in your maps folder for that map.. and in the res file put

sprites/spritename.spr

Fierce Recon: I know cl_allowdownload is 1 but i'll check the other setting

AClockworkOrange: I'll see if that helps

thanks for your replies

Hi,

I was under the asumption that you dont have to add custom sounds/models/sprites to the res file if you had them precached in the cfg file?

Correct.  If the server precaches an entity, the client will download that entity when they connect to the server if they don't already have it (unless the client has disabled downloads, in which case they will get an error message saying they can't connect).

The only time you need to use the .res file is if you have modified entities in a .bsp map file and those entities are not precached.  For example, replacing one sprite with another custom sprite by modifying the .bsp map file won't precache it, but the client will need that resource to connect to the server.  The .res file tells the client "Here's some resources you will need to connect to this server".

One more thing that i've experienced.

If you precache too many custom entities..it will crash the server(dont know the exact number), but there isnt a fix or a way around it is there?...Kind of like if you mistakenly add a model to a x y z where its touching the wall for example...either it wont load that or crash the server :/

Nope.  Loading and precaching too many entities will crash the server.

The number that can be loaded depends on what map is being loaded since each map contains a different number of entities that must also be precached.

If you have a server that's crashing due too many entities, precache fewer entities or don't run that particular map.
