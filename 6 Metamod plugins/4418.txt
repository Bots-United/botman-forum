Hello,

I tried to add this func but for some reason it doesnt work.

{ 
classname/func_nogrenades
origin/-1460 -3100 10
bbox_min/-50 -50 -50 
bbox_max/50 50 50 
} 

Coordinates are correct, maybe the bbox options arent supported by that func.
Is there a trick how to add it?

Hey flex,
Are you trying to add grens or take them away?  Or add a spot that will strip them of grens?
If you are trying to add grens I believe you have to specify the grenades/ammo.  I might be wrong, but maybe you are looking for something like this?

func_nogrenades strips grenades away from players (like in the respawn rooms).  flex isn't trying to add grenades for the player, he's trying to remove them.
