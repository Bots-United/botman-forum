I haven't found a way to get rid of the guns that the hgrunts leave behind unless you pick them up and use them. One thing you might do is to give the hgrunt more health so he doesn't die as often. If you are using stripper2, it is in the skill.cfg file and there is a monster_skill.cfg if you are using the monster_plugin.

Hope this helps,

skill.cfg should be in your valve folder if you are running DM...however, if you are running a listenserver it may not be there.

Let me know if you are running a listenserver and I will do a test to see if adding a skill.cfg file to the valve folder will allow the changing of the health, kill rate, etc. of the monsters.


<b>I went ahead and tried it and if there is a skill.cfg file in the valve folder in a Listenserver it will take precedence. If you need one let me know and I will send you one.</b>

I like garg in stalkyard...good placement and took a long time to kill.

I didn't see any HGrunts though...did I miss them?

No you didnt miss them ,heh heh I gave it some thought and threw the garg in instead :)

hope the server ran good while you were there , It gets a little laggy due to the upload speed of my cable :( after about 5 peeps enter.
