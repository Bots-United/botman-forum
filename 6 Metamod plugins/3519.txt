I have a monster that walks partially into walls. He sometimes gets stuck in there. I know there is a function_monsterclip entity but I can't find anything on how to use it. Is is something you attach to another entity or is it its own thing? I went to valve and spirit of halflife and found no help. Anyone ever used it or familiar with it?

Have you looked here:  http://www.valve-erc.com/entities/?entity=func_monsterclip

I saw above before I posted.  In that post you said you "can't find anything on how to use it," and I therefore assumed that you did not see the item at Valve-Erc, which by the way is not Valve.

Bill,I did go to the valve (or Valve-Erc) site and saw the func_monsterclip reference. It was absolutely no help whatsoever. I don't know why they even bothered with that one. I still don't know how to use it.. does it have an origin? does it modify and entity or is it an entity in its own right? It's like wanting to modify your motorbike, you go to the store for the tool and they hand you some doo-dad with no instructions and say, "good luck".

Anyway, I posted on the valve-erc forum in the editing forum about it. In the meantime, if anyone knows of a bsp file with a func_monsterclip in it, I could dump the entities using botmans BSP_tool and see one in action. Thanks again.

Why not take a look at how it's used in a valve bsp.?  lamda_bunker.bsp containes this entity (as do others).  Sorry, but I've never used it before myself; just some ideas for you to pursue.

Also, might want to simply add one in front of the wall the monsters keep walking into, and see if that blocks them (seems it would act as a func_nobuild acts in re certain items).

BTW, in windows just do a find containing text func_monsterclip in the half-life folder to find bsp's with that entity.

Well i looked at lambda and found one, but there wasnt enough info to really see how to use it. It had no origin for example and had a model number. I just really dont know how to use it.

I think I may just try sticking an invisble entity to act as a speed bump for the monster. Lately he's been hitting that wall and spazzing out and gets stuck there. It looks like he has mad cow disease or something.

I'd first try adding the func_monsterclip, with an origin, interposed between the monster and the wall and see if that does the trick.

He means some posts show up as "NEW" when they are not. I've seen this happening a lot ;D
