Nevermind.. I figured it out.. you do need a "mins" and "maxs" on dod_object_goal if you use a model.... you also have to add the model in seperately.. it's working.. but it's not firing off the "obj_donetarget" event when you bring the object to object goal... I'm probably overlooking something though. It looks like it can be done though...
