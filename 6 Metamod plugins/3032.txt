I want to define a func_button that triggers an env_explosion so as to make it that only the flag/key/ball carrier can activate it.  

I looked at the Valve Erc section that discusses func_button properties but there was nothing on this topic.  I looked at rock2 but I was unable to figure out exactly how only the key carrier activates the gas switch.

Any ideas on this one?  Thanks

I guess that you didn't read my post.  I said, "I looked at the Valve Erc section that discusses func_button properties but there was nothing on this topic."  I still don't see anything there that addresses my question.

I think you'll need to look at some of the TFC mapping tutorial sites to see how they set up entities to trigger things based on who has the flag/ball/card, etc.

The switch in rock2 isn't a button. Its an info_tfgoal that activates a multi-manager that activates the scoring, all the doors and the gas.

The doors it activates include the switch which is actualy a door the goes down. Just as elevators are usualy doors that go up (they can also be trains). Its all the same concept.

Atleast that's how I believe rock2 does it. That's how I'd do it :). I won't tell you how to do this, find it for yourself.

Hey atleast you know what to look for right :)... again this is why I recomend you decompile a map before you try and add anything to it. You can get exact coordinates, as well as find out how things are happening etc.

Actually, I did decompile rock2 and I saw that there was an info_tfgoal in that area that activated a mm, but I thought there was something more.
