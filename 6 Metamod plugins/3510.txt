With stripper2, can you put comment lines on a line by themselves like below?

// creates hgrunts

as opposed to:

{
classname/monster_maker // creates hgrunts
blah blah
}

My stripper2 cfg stopped working and I cant account for it.
-----------------

Nevermind. I figured it out.
In all my cutting and pasting I had deleted a '}' and stripper2 no lika dat!

BTW, if you have a problem in a lengthy stripper2.cfg file, there is a way to quickly zero in on the source without going through every line. If there is a problem with an entity, it and everything below it will not be executed. So put a monstermaker that you know works halfway through the cfg file. If the monster does not appear you know your problem is in the first half of the file.
