Quad damage came from Quake and TF came from Quake :).

I'm not sure if there are any TF history sites left? Might try http://planetfortress.com/ - but I can't find anything useful there :-\.

TFC mapping tutorials web sites will help show you want types of entities can be added to maps using Stripper2.

You can also look through the .fgd file for TFC (since that's what is used to create maps) to see what types of key values can be assigned to entities.  The .fgd is just a text file.  Download it from one of the TFC mapping tutorial web sites (or from www.valve-erc.com) and open it up in your favorite text editor.

I hope it's ok that I post a reply.  Quad, invisibility, and invulnerability represent Valve's homage to Id's masterpieces Quake and Quake2 where such runes appeared in the single player and MP versions of those titles.  They are info_tfgoal entities the properties of which can be found here: http://tf.valve-erc.com/

holy shit, NICE WEBSITE..  thanks for the link..

quick question... in the cfg for a flag, say the red flag.. there is a command


impulse/100

(the blue flag would have impulse/200)

is this the command for it to glow, red or blue?

thanks again you guys!
