on some maps there are fans that you can walk over and it will blow you up into the air, like a bouce pad..  how can you make one of these with stripper?  LWC? BOTS? i tried to ask mark about it, but he never answerd my email..

Its a trigger_bush

To make one: clone a wall, then set the trigger_bush entity on it.

{
calassname/trigger_push
speed/100
angles/-90 0 0 //push teh player up
//example wall
{
( -288 96 48 ) ( 464 96 48 ) ( 464 -544 48 ) 0CLIFF7 [ 1 0 0 0 ] [ 0 -1 0 0 ] 0 1 1 
( -288 -544 -16 ) ( 464 -544 -16 ) ( 464 96 -16 ) 0CLIFF7 [ 1 0 0 0 ] [ 0 -1 0 0 ] 0 1 1 
( -288 96 48 ) ( -288 -544 48 ) ( -288 -544 -16 ) 0CLIFF7 [ 0 1 0 0 ] [ 0 0 -1 0 ] 0 1 1 
( 464 96 -16 ) ( 464 -544 -16 ) ( 464 -544 48 ) 0CLIFF7 [ 0 1 0 0 ] [ 0 0 -1 0 ] 0 1 1 
( 464 96 48 ) ( -288 96 48 ) ( -288 96 -16 ) 0CLIFF7 [ 1 0 0 0 ] [ 0 0 -1 0 ] 0 1 1 
( 464 -544 -16 ) ( -288 -544 -16 ) ( -288 -544 48 ) 0CLIFF7 [ 1 0 0 0 ] [ 0 0 -1 0 ] 0 1 1 
}
}

Don't you need to be off the ground for a trigger_push to work?

I think maps that use jumppads/bouncepads/whatever use a func_door as an elevator (lift) to get the player off the ground a bit and then it triggers the trigger_push.

Check some Half-Life mapping tutorial web sites about making bounce pads to see for sure.

Yes you do need to jump inorder for the trigger push to work, most maps I've played with fans seem to want you to jump. But I've seen some maps in that the mapper forces you to fall rather then use a lift to start the trigger.

Adding a lift is too much work for me :).

BTW, a bounce pad requires solids that unless you have a lot of time and skill in cloaning a wall then warping it, you would be unable to do.

i made a mistake about who i was talking about. it wasnt mark, but hogweed.. he has a hunted server, and when you climb into the vent (the short cut) there is a force that blows you up the vent to the next level (so you dont need to be shot up by a soldier)...

really cool, but i cant get it to work.  :o(

I've got some time right now, I'll see what I can come up with.

I probablty wont make stripper config, but rather recompile the map (it's easier).
