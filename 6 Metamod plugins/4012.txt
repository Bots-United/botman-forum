just replace the mdl with the mdl you want to use, make sure that the mdl is in the mod/modles folder, e.g. C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\tfc\models

I think info_tfgoal is only found in TFC?

I thought he meant changing models the way an info_tfgoal can swap between two models depending on whats going on (but then I realized its the item_tfgoal that does that :P)

No idea what cs uses, but he asked for info_tfgoal.
