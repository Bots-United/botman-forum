First of all, thanks for botman's monster plugin that brings us more joy definitely...
And I don't know its possibility, but just have an idea, while one player was killed by monster, could you turn him to the "mosnter" too ? I believe it would be another nightmare for other living players, right, even you turn the dead man to the monster, but it's better to keep his dress and shape, just make him looks a bit weird(green eyes? bloody suitform? ).
thanks !

Is this a impossible suggestion from tech. view?
Seems no one can answer... :-(

I'm not going to add this feature.  It's probably possible via a trick.  The player would really get killed, but when the plugin detects that a player was killed, it would spawn a monster at the last known position of the now dead player.

The models of the "player" would still have to use the standard monster models unless you were willing to create brand new models for a monster and force the clients to download them to their machine when they connect to the server.

I don't think many people would use something like this and, like I said, I'm not going to be adding this as a feature to the Monter plugin.
