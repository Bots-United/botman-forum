Open up the ports on the router needed to host a dedicated server.  Counter-Server has some good information on correctly configuring a Half-Life dedicated server (this applies to ALL MODs, not just Counter-Strike)...

http://server.counter-strike.net/

Spend some time reading through their site, and/or visit their forums.
