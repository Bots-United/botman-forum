i am a total noob at this stuff... just registered today.  i downloaded the source for the monster plugin but it wouldnt compile in MSVC++ v6. it told me that i was missing dllapi.h. several other .h files as well.  am i supposed to get these files from the meta mod source or something?  

im sorry for posting this here... i bet somewhere in this mass of forums theres something about this already... couldnt find it in the search though. i was wondering if anyone knows of some kind of "Hello World" plugin for meta mod that i could look at to get started.

id really appreciate any help i can get... thanks,
Gambit

Yes, you will need to install Metamod first and get that to build.

Then install the Monster plugin source into the metamod directory (the same directory where the sample plugins are located, i.e. stub_plugin, trace_plugin, wdmisc_plugin).  You should have a "monster_plugin" directory at the same level as the metamod sample plugins.

Metamod REQUIRES that you have Half-Life SDK installed already.  You will need to change the Include file path in the MSVC project for metamod to get it to properly find the Half-Life SDK files that metamod needs.

Metamod is a bit of a pain to get configured properly so that it builds.  The monster plugin does NOT require the Half-Life SDK include files (like metamod does), but since the Monster plugin is a metamod plugin, the Monster plugin DOES require include files from the metamod source distribution.
