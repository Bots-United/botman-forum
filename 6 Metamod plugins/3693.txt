hi, im pretty new to stripper and i have been plugging away at if for a few days and had some fun adding extra gren packs in hunted and putting teleporting spheres in a few maps.. but now i wan to change the flag model in the maps to somthing diffrent... can some post a quick config on stripping and adding a new model...  

also, do i need to add the new model to the maps res file, or will the game automatically dl it?

thanks..

Flags in TFC are usually done using "item_tfgoal" entitites.  Use...

bsp_tool -ent 2fort.bsp >2fort.txt

...to dump the entities for 2FORT.  Open 2fort.txt in Notepad (or any text editor), and search for "item_tfgoal" or "flag.mdl".

You can strip out the item_tfgoal entity in the Stripper2 .cfg file for 2FORT then in the [add] section, put a new item_tfgoal back in with the same key/value pairs as the original, except change the "mdl" key to be something else (like mdl/models/ball.mdl to change it to a soccer ball).

Yes you will need a res file to have it dl the custom flag.

Also, don't forget to PRECACHE_MODEL() in the Stripper2 .cfg for the new model that you use.

or if someone could post an example of removing a model and replacing it with a diffrent one would be simply swell...

Here's an example of a Stripper2 .cfg file for 2FORT that replaces the red flag with a ball...
code:
[strip]
item_tfgoal (-512 3200 -656)

[add]
{
classname/item_tfgoal
netname/Red Flag
noise3/#2fort_your_flag_returned
noise4/#2fort_enemy_flag_returned
mdl/models/ball.mdl
goal_no/2
goal_activation/4789
pausetime/60
team_no/1
owned_by/2
netname_team_broadcast/#2fort_got_enemy_flag
team_broadcast/#2fort_team_takes_enemy_flag
netname_non_team_broadcast/#2fort_enemy_takes_flag
items/262144
message/#2fort_you_take_enemy_flag
skin/1
team_speak/!CTF_GOTFLAG
non_team_speak/!CTF_LOSTFLAG
goal_result/16
g_e/1
impulse/200
AP_speak/!CTF_YOUGOTFLAG
netname_non_team_drop/#2fort_lost_red_flag
netname_team_drop/#2fort_lost_red_flag
owners_team_broadcast/#2fort_your_flag_taken
team_drop/#2fort_enemy_lost_flag
non_team_drop/#2fort_lost_enemy_flag
angles/0 135 0
origin/-512 3200 -656
}

...just do the same thing to the blue flag (i.e. use bsp_tool -ent to dump the entities, then search for "flag.mdl", then cut and past that into the Stripper2.cfg [add] section with the changes you want.

EDIT: The '{','}' shouldn't be in the [strip] section.
