There are clip brushes in the world that prevent the player from passing through them.

You can't strip these out because they aren't entities, they are world BSP brushes.  You would need to open the map source in Worldcraft/Hammer, remove the brushes, recompile the map, then clients would be forced to download that map when they connect to your server.
