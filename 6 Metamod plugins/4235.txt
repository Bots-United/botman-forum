I currently use stripper2 to make my service run with Paratroop models and weapons. I have been unsuccessful in my experiments to remove the in game air strikes. I have also been attempting to change some of the removable wall and door entities. In the map, there are certain walls and doors I wish to restrict from being blow with the in game tnt. I have not been able to do anything but crash the server. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I'm not an expert but I think you can remove the Air raids, which are really mortars with the following:  I don't think you can change the hole blowing but you could strip in a wall or something else in front or behind.   You could make a teleport or trigger_hurt to stop access too.
Remove Mortars:
[strip]
func_mortar_field
env_explosion
env_shake
trigger_hurt
