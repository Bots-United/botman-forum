No candy, he doesn't mean that, he wants to be able to put his own text in a windows that looks like the MOTD window.
It is possible, since I've seen it, but don't know how to do it, sorry

did you mean messages when you pick up certain objects such as backpacks? or the flag in tfc?

there is a plugin for adminmod that cycles a list of messages on the screen for all the players to see..

its called MOTM
