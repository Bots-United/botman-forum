{
"origin" "-475 -2146 -1819"
"frags" "1"
"health" "50" <-- I added this. But i can't kill it.
"no_grenades_2" "0"
"owned_by" "2"
"angles" "0 89 0"
"rendercolor" "0 0 0"
"team_no" "2"
"spawnflags" "32"
"classname" "monster_turret"
}

Is func_breakable the answer?

In the SDK, the "monster_turret" entity sets it's own health using the skill data (skill.cfg in the valve pak0.pak file).

I assume you are trying to create a "monster_turret" in TFC (but you didn't state this).

Does TFC allow you to destroy turrets like you can in single player?  Have you seen any example maps in TFC that have turrets (not sentry guns) that can be destroyed?  TFC might not allow this.  You might want to search TFC mapping sites (start with planetfortress.com) to see if anyone shows an example of adding a "killable" turret to a TFC map.  If not, it's probably not possible.

I think you pretty much answered my question..

Q)I assume you are trying to create a "monster_turret" in TFC (but you didn't state this).
A) Yeah, to a point that's what i'm trying for. I want to use the "monster_turret" in (crossfire). So what i did, is renamed "crossfire" to "crossfire_tfc" and i changed the second line in the map itself to this:
{
"origin" "488 -1000 -1600"
"angle" "255"
"classname" "info_tfdetect"
}
That way i could plop it into my TFC\maps folder & it would recognize the map.. Then this Great idea i had about destroying the "monster_turret", came from when i was playing "Rocket Crowbar" and  i watched a bot play as a "monster_turret" & get destroyed..

Q) Does TFC allow you to destroy turrets like you can in single player?

A) Excellent question! I have no idea.. Your the botman.. Your supposed to know these things.. hehe..

Q) Have you seen any example maps in TFC that have turrets (not sentry guns) that can be destroyed?

A) I've gotta lotta tfc maps, but i've yet to see this happen in a map.

And then reading the rest of your post, that's what i meant you've pretty much answered this as probably not being possible.. Unless, i can use your entities.exe on Rocket Crowbar & see if anything comes up.? I guess i'll check it out.

Ya know, i do have another question that i really just can't seem to figure.. Even Wally hasn't given me the answer.. I do have the current SDK, but that might as well be wrote in Japanesse.. I bet you might know, but i'll try & do some more searching on my own 1st..
