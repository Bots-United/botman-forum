ok, can you change what a player starts with?

for example, i added some weapons to HUNTED...  the hunted gets a shotgun and knife to start with..

i tried to give him a pyro rocket launcer, then i tried to give him a chain gun.. but when he picks them up there empty. and cant resupply...  i dont want to make the game unfair, i was going to limit the shells to 50-75 for the chain gun and 20 pryo rockets.. 

if there is any way to have him respawn with some ammo id like to hear it..

well, that helped somewhat.. i poured over the thread, and have better understanding.. i now added engineers and pyros to hunted... (woot!)

but i still cant get the civilian to resupply off of the ammopacks.. i cant figure out why he cant fill up an empty rpg...

LWC, i read over your 2fort hunted config.. if you have any ideas toss them my way..

pleeze.. for a fellow minnesotan!

You cannot do this, as far as I know the only mod able to directly change players ammo (including Civilian) is my AutoOP Shodan mod, you can contact me (rob@planetfortress.com) for more information. You could write a plugin for shodan that will give the civvie the guns and so much ammo when he spawns.

Just giving Mr.Civilian backpacks will not work as TFC will not give him ammo.
