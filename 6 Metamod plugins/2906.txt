What exactly does the code for the wall mean?

I understand that it goes something allong the lines of
X, Y, Z, Texture Name, Possition, Scale, Render Amount (?) for each vertice. And if that the right line up why is it that the X Y Z coordinates have three numbers a peice?

I've been mapping almost as long as I've had Half-Life, 2 years or so, and I have use notepad to tweak maps. I've looked for tutorials on what the walls mean, the only one I found was http://countermap.counter-strike.net/Tutorials/tutorial.php?id=40 which was a useless "Oh look I made a room but don't know what anything I wrote means" tutorial.

Most of the mappers I've asked have either had no clue what it means, or have some idea but can't explain it... so anyone?

Edit:
The only way I can think to add walls or triggers to the map is to decompile the map, open WC then add the entity, give it a name and close WC. Open Notepad search for the name of the entity and copy and paste it. Which is too much work, especialy since decompilers are a mess... stupid compilers and their triangles :D.

It sounds like you are talking about surfaces (not func_wall).  A surface in Worldcraft is a plane (it goes off in all directions infinitely).

When two surfaces intersect, they form a line.  When two lines intersect, they form a point (or a vertex).  A polygon in Worldcraft is made up of several planes that all intersect each other to form lines (edges around the polygon surface) and vertexes (the intersection of the edges around the polygon surface).

To represent a plane in 3D space, all you need is 3 points (N points in N degree space will form a point, line, plane, etc.).  In the .map file Worldcraft only stores the 3 points that are needed to define this plane (that's why "surfaces" only have 3 sets of X,Y,Z points to define them not 4 or more).

There was a reply I made to a post on the Wavelength coding forum several weeks ago that gave a little more detail, but I can't seem to find it right now.
