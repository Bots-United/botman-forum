botman i read somewhere that you can set a sprite to display at a certain angle..no matter where the player is viewing it from..it will face the same angle.
i want to know how i would add this info to the env_sprite properties

You dont need to do anything to display it same angle anywhere you are looking.
You might be able to rotate it with "angles" "90 0 0" for example. Never tried that...

Search the metamod section of this forum for "oriented sprite".

Let me know if you need any info on sprites. I've been messing around with them for months now. Tricky little devils they are.

I don't believe it's possible to set a sprite angle, it would be kind of pointless as it defeats what its designed to be.

For the most part sprites will look fine no matter how you look at them...

Map that I'm working on, uses tons of sprites (all the trees). No matter where in the map, even running through them, they look fine.

It is possible. I do them all the time on my server. You do have to make a new sprite however. And some things don't look right if they always face the player.

I found it easiest to accomplish this using triAPI on the client.

All players can see the changes then?
