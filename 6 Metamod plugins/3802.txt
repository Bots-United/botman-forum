is it possible to change the team models? 

example have one team be the GORDON model, and the other team be SCIENTISTS's?  in tfc of course..  

i dont think that anyone would have to dl the models, due to the fact i think ther in the game..  

anyways, just curious...

hey ACO, is there a server where you put all of the modifications that you ask about into action?

if you get this idea working, then i would really like to see it. =-)
