hi there!
is there a way to remove several entities for 20%.

i DO know u can set:
weapon_shotgun 20
weapon_mp5 20

but they are NOT necessarily removed *together* IF they are removed.

how can i remove them both at a certain chance?

There isn't any way to remove a group of entities together.  The only thing you can do is assign a random percent to each like you have shown.
