Hey.

Is it possible to make a mm plugin that prevents wall gaussing?
You know the gauss/tau in Half-Life, you can shoot thru walls and kill everything that's nearby. I really hate it and just think it's lame. Ok, so it takes some skill to figure out where to shot to frag most, but the rest takes like no skill at all to pull of, just some minor aiming.
What I would want is to disable the gauss abillity to shoot through walls at all. I mean, the gauss is good enough even without it. With more than 2 cells charged you will most likely get a frag if you hit. And the add that you can use it to jump higher.
I guess this forum wasn't made for requests.. But I only know how to use metamod plugins, I have no knowledge in coding them. And since, if it's possible, this should be pretty easy I guess. Well, it's worth asking anyway.

No, because that's in the gauss gun code which you can't change.

The only thing you can do is strip out the gauss gun (tau cannon) from all of the maps you play.

See my planethalflife.com/botman/stripper2.shtmlStripper2 plugin for metamod to do this.

A server op named Michael mentioned to me once that he modified the tau so it did less damage. Not sure if that would help, but I believe he monitors this forum so he should see this eventually.

I did modify the source code where the secondary tau damage can be limited so it cannot go through walls or can be left alone just by changing a new cVar in the skill.cfg file.

I have provided a couple of people with the dll (windows only at this point) so if you are interested, email me directly.

Also included in the dll is getting points for killing monsters, monster HGrunts do not leave their weapons behind when they die (caused too many entity issues) and icky disappears when he dies so he can be created in a monstermaker without over overpopulating.
