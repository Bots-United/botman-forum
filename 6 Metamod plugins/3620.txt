 I am a noob to all this map editing stuff (never took the time to try and change things) but now I am interested in what you can do. I was just wondering if there was any way (maybe useing Stripper) to make it so that HL maps can be used in CS.

#1 CS only supports 2 teams yet HL has 4 (like in Crossfire) the teams get stacked (8 on 1) if you play it in CS. Anyway to fix it so there is only 2 teams or that people ony spawn on 2 teams?

#2 In Crossfire after every round the "alarm" sound continues to play, I don't have to keep typeing "stopsound" in the console everyround. Is there a way to stop that?

 I don't know if it's possible or not cause like I said I'm a noob when it comes to this so ANY help would be GREATLY accepted!

 thx

#1. Go look at some Counter-Strike mapping tutorial websites to understand what entities MUST exist in Counter-Strike maps (specifically things like "info_player_start" and "info_player_deathmatch" being used as spawn points).

#2. You can just strip out this sound entity if you don't want it to play at all.  You can modify the sound so that it's not a looping sound if you only want it to play once.  You can't change the behaviour of how entities work (this is in the Counter-Strike code), for example you can't do something like change a smoke grenade so that it throws of spark showers instead of smoke (because the smoke is in the code, not the entity), thus the sound changes you want to make might not be possible depending on what CS maps support (again visit the mapping tutorial sites to learn more).
