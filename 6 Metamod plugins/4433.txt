well i had a prob with your monster plugin botman; after i spawn one the game it exits to the console with a message something like illegel user message 128 or sumtin like that. Although it works fine with other mods. btw i've set mp_allowmonsters to 1 and spawned them on both ways (with precaching and then ingame, and with a file).
btw this mod(esf) have smaller models and maps and such.

well since i know botman you have a busy life (who don't) i want to ask have you a solution or could i 'code a solution' for this prob ??

More than likely this is the 'Damage' message attempting to be sent to the client and ESF has removed this 'Damage' message and replaced it with their own.

If ESF displays damage indicators in a different way than Half-Life deathmatch (or doesn't display damage at all), that would be a pretty good indication that the 'Damage' message is missing on the client.

There's not much you can do about this unless you want to download the Monster plugin source code and remove the Damage message stuff in the UTIL_TakeDamage function (found in util.cpp).  Just comment out this section...
code:
            if (gmsgDamage == 0)
                  gmsgDamage = REG_USER_MSG( "Damage", -1 );

            MESSAGE_BEGIN( MSG_ONE, gmsgDamage, NULL, VARS(pEdict) );
                  WRITE_BYTE( 0 );
                  WRITE_BYTE( fTookDamage );
                  WRITE_LONG( visibleDamageBits );
                  WRITE_COORD( pevInflictor->origin.x );
                  WRITE_COORD( pevInflictor->origin.y );
                  WRITE_COORD( pevInflictor->origin.z );
            MESSAGE_END();
