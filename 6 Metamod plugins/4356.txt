hi botman, the monster plugin works just fine with mod Firearms. There's a lil problem tho, whenever i try explosives or high powered guns on a weak/weakened enemy, the game kind of crashes and the console appears, it says hgibs/agibs not precached(or something :\). Now when i did a search for those 2 models, i cant find any in the half life folder. So, how do i fix this problem?
