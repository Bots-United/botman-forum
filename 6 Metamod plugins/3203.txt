If you are trying to determine which angle to use when spawning things in the game using the Stripper2 or the Monster metamod plugin, you will need to pay attention to which way the X and Y axis is in the map.  You can do this by using "status" in the console to print the current origin, move to the left or right (or forward or backwards) and use "status" again to see whether X or Y increased or decreased.  You can use this to orient yourself in the map.  Here's a simple picture to show the angles based on the direction of the X and Y axis...
code:
             +Y 90
              ^
              I
              I
              I
              I
180 -X ---------------> +X 0
              I
              I
              I
              I
             -Y 270

...the center of the graph is (0,0,0) in the map.  If you are walking in the direction that X increases, you are walking in the 0 degrees angle.  If you are walking in the direction that X is decreasing, you are walking in the 180 degrees angle.  If you are walking in the direction that Y increases, you are walking in the 90 degrees angle.  If you are walking in the direction that Y decreases, you are walking in the 270 degrees angle.

NOTE: The "status" console command will only give you useful information if you are running a listen server (i.e. the server was created on your machine and isn't a dedicated server).  Otherwise, "status" will just give you x=0, y=0, z=0.
