Do you mean other than using an animated sprite?

I think the best way to do this is with animated sprites.  Perhaps you can find some prefab fire sprites on mapping websites.

Did you try creating a dynamic light?  Again, see mapping tutorial websites on the entites required to do this.  I've never tried it myself so I don't know if it works or not.
