Anyone know the entity and/or flag that tells a player that he is being damaged by: cold, electrical shock, fire, etc?  For instance, when a player walks on a wet floor that has live wire on it he gets zapped and then something on the HUD shows a little electrical bolt on player's screen.  I'm fairly sure I once read about this as something one can add via stripper2 or zhlt.

Thanks
