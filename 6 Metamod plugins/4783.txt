I don't think sprites can be angled in arbitary directions.

There's this code in the env_sprite entity of the SDK...
code:
      // Worldcraft only sets y rotation, copy to Z
      if ( pev->angles.y != 0 && pev->angles.z == 0 )
      {
            pev->angles.z = pev->angles.y;
            pev->angles.y = 0;
      }

...which basically says, "If the YAW is not zero and the ROLL is zero, then make the ROLL equal to the YAW".

I assume you are using the "angles" key when creating the entity and NOT the "angle" key when creating the entity.  The "angle" key will only set the YAW (not matter how many numbers you give it).

As far as the PITCH, YAW, and ROLL, goes, the pitch is just whether it's tilted forwards or backwards (like your body leaning forward).  pitch=0 means level straight up.  A negative pitch will tilt down, and a positive pitch will tilt upwards (leaning backwards).  The YAW is just turning in place (like your body rotating around an axis from your head to your feet).  ROLL is tilting sideways (as if you had a pole rammed through your stomach from front to back and you can pivot on the pole).

i managed to get a grasp on it, i followed bruce broadways advice and set up 4 sprites in a row and went from there.. went pretty fast....
