I need some help on making a counterstrike server with no rounds. Only deathmatch with respawn. I need to add more respawn points, strip objectives, remove teams, make buy times infinitie, and add things like heath packs, armor things, and maybe some ammo. I am thinking stripper2 would be the perfect thing to cover it all, but I dont know where to get started. From past experience, I know botman is really smart and would know how to do it all. Thanks for your help =)

Nope.  Can't be done (not without creating your own MOD anyway).

Much of what you want to change is hard coded into the Counter-Strike DLL.  You would need the source code to Counter-Strike to change these behaviors (like no rounds, infinite buy time, player respawning, etc.).

You would be better to take Counter-Strike maps and convert them to use Half-Life deathmatch multiplayer spawn points, changing the weapons skins/models (you still can't change how they fire, just how they look and sound).  Even this would require a lot of work because you can't just copy weapon models from CS into HL because the animations in the weapons MUST match the animations that are hard coded into the game DLL (which CS and Half-Life deathmatch DON'T match).

Like I said at the start of this reply, it would be easier to create your own Counter-Strike-like MOD than to attempt to modify CS or HL to be a mixture of the two.

You could do team deathmatch? If I remember right you can set the buy time to whatever, but then again - I play TFC not CS.

CS mapping info - http://countermap.counter-strike.net

CS server info - http://server.counter-strike.net

That would give you the cvars to use for unlimited buy time and such (if they exist).
