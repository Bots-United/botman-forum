You have a bad zombie.mdl file.  The body origin for the zombie.mdl file you have is at the center of the body (just like player models would be).  The origin is supposed to be at the feet.

Look in the MOD's "models" folder for a "zombie.mdl" file and rename it to something else (zombie_bad.mdl?).  Then start the game again and I bet the problem will be fixed.

You probably got the model by connecting to someone's server who had modified the zombie model for some strange reason and the server downloaded that modified model to your client.
