How come when running a HLDS Server 4.1.1.1 with botmixer 5000 it won't work?
Is there a fix out?
This is the error I get below after metamod 1.16 is loaded or still loading.
BotMixer5000 - Error determining MOD directory name!

Are you trying to use it with a MOD that it wasn't designed for?  See the ReadMe.txt file for a list of the MODs that are supported.

I'm using the Counter-Strike 1.5 MOD.
Botmixer has worked in HLDS before I installed 4.1.1.1 (or DOD 1.0).

Bots used:
Real Bot
PODBOT
Joe Bot

If you are using Counter-Strike and getting that error, then it sounds like the BotMixer5000 addon wasn't installed properly.

Did you run the Install.bat batch file to install it or manually copy the files?
