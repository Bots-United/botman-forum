you get rid of the "out of sfx_t" error by not precaching all of the monsters at once.

Don't precache all your monsters. :)
Precache only the monsters you know you'll need.

If the problem continues, precache fewer and fewer. Experiment until you find the right number for you.

go to your mod directory, tfc or cs folder.. look for a document called monster precache (somthing like that) and put "//" infront of the monster names..  you should only have 4-5 without the // in front of them...  this only affects manual spawning of monsters.. not your monster configs..

Look in your readme file. 
When in doubt read the instructions. :)

It Mostly Depends On Mod and How Much It Requires From Computer,Natural Selection For Example You cant precache the most working number "6" monsters,in that mod you can only precache 1-2 without getting the error.Depends alot on mod and how much it uses SFX in diffrent situtations.

Actually it will depend more on the map that's loaded.  Some maps will have a larger number of entities than others.  You will find that for smaller maps you can typically precache more stuff.  For larger maps, you will need to precache less stuff.

If you run lots of large maps, precache very few monsters.  If you run lots of small maps, you can precache a few more, but you probably won't have many maps (or any maps) where you can precache ALL of the monsters at once.

Not only do precached entities cause this error but also precached wav files that work with plugin_sank_sounds for admin mod.

Monstermod wont work with current build of Ns because massive amount of entities the maps use,i dont know about the custom maps.Current Mods I Know Monstermod works from 1-6 monsters:Firearms,Action Half Life,Public Enemy,Desert Crisis,Stargate tc(www.stargatetc.com).Svencoop works with All Monsters i quess
