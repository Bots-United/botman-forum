Search for "Making Sprites", and botman I finally did create oriented sprites, I found you had to edit them with a hex editor.

http://www.cryotank.net/maps/tutorials/sprites1.html   for a read about how to do it.

See this...

Oriented means the sprites always face a specific direction instead of rotating to face the player.  This is usefull when you want the sprite to appear to be a decal sprayed on the wall.  If the sprite isn't oriented, it will rotate "into" the wall and part of it won't be visible.

"and botman I finally did create oriented sprites"

Cool.  I didn't spend much time with it, but from the posts on the VERC forum, it sounded like people were able to get oriented sprites working with Worldcraft/Hammer, they just didn't explain what they had to do.

when i went in and modified a sprite, and tried it on my dod server, it locks up and says 

needs to be version 2, not 3

(3 is oriented sprite)

is this a dod mod thing ?

Yes, it sounds like DoD doesn't like oriented sprites.  I'm not sure why they would want to prevent them.

You might try to contact one of the DoD coders by e-mail and ask if he knows anything about this.

Are you sure your modifying the right thing.

The "version 2" verses "version 3" sounds more like an old Quake I sprite verses a Half-Life sprite.  Perhaps Quake I sprites are version 2 and Half-Life sprites are version 3.

If you are editing the sprite with a hex editor, you might be changing the wrong byte.

Actually, nothing more than sprite mage is needed to create an oriented sprite.

As far as transparency, I think they are inherantly so.

I don't see anything wrong with that.

Try using SprWiz to create your sprite and see if you get the same results.

I realized something last night about the transparent sprite.

Make SURE the last color in your palette (index 255) isn't a color that you use anywhere in the sprite.  Valve traditionally uses pure blue (red=0, green=0, blue=255) for transparency, but you can use any color you want.  For example, if you have black (red=0, green=0, blue=0) as the color in index 255 of the palette, then ANYWHERE in the sprite that black appears will be transparent in the final sprite.

Try changing your palette 255 index color to pure red or pure green or some other color that you don't use anywhere in the sprite.
