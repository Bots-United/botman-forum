I have sucessfully added quad_damage and invincibility to a map but when i get them the effect only lasts 30seconds, I would like it to last forever and stay at full damage instead of wearing out. the cfg file is as follows at the moment:

[add]
{
classname/item_artifact_super_damage
angle/0
origin/-1309 1367 663
}
{
classname/item_artifact_invulnerability
angle/0
origin/-1340 1367 663
}

what do i need to add to make the effect of those entities^^ last forver??

thx rev

here is a config of mine, for the red team in well..

{
"origin" "-1199 -1573 130"
"angles" "0 0 0"
"g_e" "1"
"goal_result" "16"
"noise" "misc/holyshit.wav"
"owned_by" "2"
"items" "33554432"
"team_no" "2"
"playerclass" "6"
"g_a" "585"
"mdl" "models/pquad.mdl"
"super_damage_finished" "30" 
"message" "QUAD DAMAGE"
"goal_no" "100"
"classname" "item_tfgoal"
}


now i must explain it first.. 

1. its from a map i ripped with ripent, so its not in stripper2 format..

2. it has the same properties as a flag, so if you have it in reach of a bot, it will grab it and run to the cap point and run in circles..

3. the player carries the quad icon on his back, and glows.. 

4 the quad glows your team color, and hws should  not be able to pick it up..

5. spys cant be quaded and go undercover..


you can convert it to str format real easy and it will work, you will need to modify the model and sound wave to suit your needs.. i found the model in the dmc models folder...


here is the blue quad in well just for sh*ts and giggles..


{
"origin" "-1382 1830 130"
"angles" "0 90 0"
"g_e" "1"
"goal_result" "16"
"noise" "misc/holyshit.wav"
"owned_by" "1"
"items" "33554432"
"team_no" "1"
"playerclass" "6"
"g_a" "585"
"mdl" "models/pquad.mdl"
"super_damage_finished" "30" 
"message" "QUAD DAMAGE"
"goal_no" "100"
"classname" "item_tfgoal"
}
