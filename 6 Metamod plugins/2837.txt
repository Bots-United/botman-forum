I was wondering if its possible to compile stripper2 (or any metamod plugin for that case) using mingw (devc++)

Also, I can compile the stripper2 plugin under vc++ fine, but most other metamod plugins wont compile for me. I think I set it up wrong or summin. In options, I just added the sdk's common, engine and dlls folder to the include dirs. I also added the metamod source dir to the list of include dirs. Like I said, stripper2 compiles fine with this setup, but most other plugins dont (csguard etc). Can anyone help me?

I didn't like the way most metamod plugins are built.  They assume that you have the SDK installed in some weird default directory and rely on the SDK .h files being located there.  It's a hard coded path in the .dsp files and not even a relative directory from the metamod source directory.

I copied all of the SDK files that I needed to a local directory and put EVERYTHING needed by the Stripper2 source code into the .zip file (so you don't have to set up your directories in any special fashion except to unzip the Stripper2 source code into the metamod directory.

I'm sure that the Stripper2 source code could be compiled using MinGW but I haven't tried.  There isn't anything in there that's Microsoft specific and metamod is built on Linux first (using gcc) and then ported to Windows when releases of it are being made.
