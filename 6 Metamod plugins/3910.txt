Ok i have everything setup like i'm supposed to.
but it doesnt work.
I checked my log files on my server and it says 
Make sure you have file_access_read 1 in server.cfg/listenserver.cfg

the thing is that i already do have it set to 1

so what do i need to do?

What?

Did you follow the ReadMe.txt file that comes with the Monster plugin?  I.E., did you install metamod by itself FIRST and turn on server logging to verify that metamod was loading correctly?  If not, start there.  When you get the metamod welcome message when the server starts up, then you can move on to installing the Monster plugin and getting it to work.

Post the contents of the error message in your server.log file.  What you mentioned doesn't mean anything to me.  It sounds like you don't have metamod installed or configured correctly yet.

Uh, that error is an adminmod error, it happens when a AdminMod plugin requires you to have accesss_write set to 1...

Are you sure you have it set up right?

I think thats coming from an old version of my adminmod plugin. It needs to be set in adminmod.cfg with the new version of adminmod.
