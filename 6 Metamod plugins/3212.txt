I was wondering, do you have any plans to make monsters only attack a particular team?  This might be an interesting aspect if monsters helped protect your team's base.  It would be really cool if you could have, say, a squad of soldiers near your flag or an alien slave sitting out front of respawn... and if you DON'T have such plans, I hope ya reconsider.  8)

No.  Teams are not handled in a standard way across all MODs, thus there would have to be very MOD specific code in the Monster plugin to know how each MOD handles teams.  I don't want to make the Monster plugin MOD specific and want to keep it as generic as possible.  If someone else wants to take the source code and make a team specific modification of the Monster plugin, that's fine with me.

Couldn't you make an alternate version for one or two of the more popular mods?  Like TFC and CS?  If you don't wanna that's fine, but I really don't know who else would.  I'd edit a version myself, but I don't have that kind of expertise in bots (or pretty much ANY coding for that matter).
