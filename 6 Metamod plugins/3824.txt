I have been working with your plugin for just a few weeks now and I'm getting the hang of the basic entities.  Sometimes, though, an item doesn't appear at the coordinates.  I have tried precaching the model, even though it is used other places in the map and is a standard in the HLDM mod.  Any ideas?  (I'm sure they're not appearing in the wall next to where I want them)

Post the .cfg file entry for one that works and one that doesn't.
