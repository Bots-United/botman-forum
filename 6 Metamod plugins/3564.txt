I start up a lan game and nothing happens at all.
I have read the text and this is what i have done.

install metamod

Copy the metamod.dll
Change //gamedll "dlls\hl.dll" to "dlls\metamod.dll"

copy the monster_mm.dll
create "metamod.ini" enter the two lines.
copy 2fort_monster.cfg to maps folder
Copy the monster_skill.cfg
create "metaexec.cfg" enter the line monster_log 1
"monster_precache.cfg"

However i really don't understand this part?

"Then you will need to enable logging when you start up
your server.  This can be done by adding "+log on" on the command line when
starting your server.  The log files will be placed in a "logs" folder in
the MOD folder (for example C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\cstrike\logs).

If you want to turn off the Monster plugin logging, you can change the
"monster_log" setting from "1" to "0" in the metaexec.cfg file.  To turn
off logging completely, remove the "+log on" from the command line."

I don't have a logs folder, anywhere!!!
so i just added +log on to my command line, like this.

C:\SIERRA\Counter-Strike\cstrike.exe -dev -toconsole +log on

Same with my TFC shortcut.

Then when i start the game i pull down the console and enter monster_log 1, but nothing happens, i have tried this with or without the "+log on" in my command line.

BTW: i am using counterstrike retail 1003 and using the oddbot not the botman bot.

Once you start the server, monster wont load. You need to change to a diffrent map before it will (when using a non-dedicated server).

You mean Monster will not work in Listenserver? Normally bots are run threw that server.

I use it in a listen server setup all the time and never have any problems spawning monsters even on the first map.
