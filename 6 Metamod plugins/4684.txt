Did you read the ReadMe.txt file that's included with the Monster plugin?

That would be the first step.  Then ask a specific question about something you don't understand and someone can help you, but don't just ask "Tell me everything I need to know", nobody's going to go into that much detail since there's more than just a paragraph or two of stuff you'll have to do.

Yes i did read the ReadMe.txt file.What exactly should the gamedll line read in the liblist.gam to launch metamod and monstermod along with adminOP?

I don't know anything about adminOP, but you will need the gamedll option to point to the metamod.dll file to load metamod.

You can't have more than one gamedll option in the liblist.gam file.  You should have it point to the metamod DLL and metamod will load any plugins.

If adminOP is a metamod plugin, then metamod will load it.  If adminOP is a hook type DLL (like the HPB bot), you can only load metamod OR adminOP via the gamedll option in metamod.

You CAN use the +localinfo command line parameter to get metamod to load ONE other hook type DLL.  Search this forum for "+localinfo" to see threads on how to do this.

Go to metamod.org
Click on the "Using Metamod" link.
It tells you:

Edit the "liblist.gam" file in your game directory, replacing the game dll filename with the Metamod dll filename. For instance with Counter-Strike, you would change: 

gamedll "dlls/mp.dll" 
gamedll_linux "dlls/cs_i386.so" 
to: 
gamedll "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod.dll" 
gamedll_linux "addons/metamod/dlls/metamod_i386.so" 
Note that it's only really necessary to change the line corresponding to your OS (win32 or linux); you can leave the other line unchanged, or you can change it - it doesn't matter. 

you will need to add a line to plugins.ini for the moster plugin.
See the examples of adding in plugins on Metamod.org

"how do i make a TFC server through a router"

Use www.google.com to search for "half-life dedicated server router" or something similar for details on setting up Half-Life servers with routers.

unfortunatly this is not a hlds website.. its a website for BOTMANS PLUGINS ONLY... 

try the united admins website, go to there forums and look for the server section...

http://forums.unitedadmins.com/index.php?showtopic=18149

this will show you what ports you need to forward for counterstrike, its the same as tfc, execpt you dont need to forward the 27010 - 27012 ports for VAC.

jeeze..

go to this site and go to the forums..


http://www.unitedadmins.com/

look for the hlserver section...   there are many many posts about it there..


for tfc you only need to forward these ports

6002 tcp
7002 tcp
5273 tcp
27015 udp (or whatever port you run)

for cs and dod (using valve anti cheat)

27010-27012 udp
