Hey I'd just like to see some of these monsters in action in counter-strike maybe hehe.. Trouble is I don't know what servers have the monster plugin! Would there be any way to filter those that have it (Checking a cvar maybe) Or maybe you could post some of your server addresses :)

I dunno if this kinda thing has been posted before (I couldn't be bothered searching :() and I'd think it would be something that a lot of people on narrow band, who can't really create a decent server, would ask for...!

I am running the metamod plugin with the admin-mod plugin on my CS server. Check it out.

And you could probably search for the monster_spawn cvar. But don't ask me how to search specific cvars...

No way to filter monster servers at the moment..
lets hope that botman adds (hint hint)

cvar_t init_monster_version = {"monster_version", VVERSION, FCVAR_EXTDLL|FCVAR_SERVER|FCVAR_UNLOGGED, 0, NULL};

to next version :9
