monstermod works like a charm with cs, but how do you make sure that the monsters are gone when a new round starts?

punishing campers is one thing, but it really doesn't work when the monsters survive until the next round :)

The Monster plugin doesn't know anything about the MOD.

Rounds (as in Counter-Strike) are MOD specific (no two MODs implement rounds in the same way).

You would have to add code to the Monster plugin to detect when a round has ended (or started) and kill off any monsters that are currently still alive.  I would recommend looking at any Counter-Strike bot that has source code available to find ways to determine when a round has ended/begun in Counter-Strike.

it's no problem to issue a rcon-command at the end of round, via a perl script that listen to logaddress.

I figured out that "rcon slaymonsters" did the trick on a modified version of monster-mod, is it in the original too?

No, there is no "slaymonsters" command in my Monster plugin.  Someone either added this on their own or created another plugin that does this for you.
