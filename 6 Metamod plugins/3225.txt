Well, I installed Monster metamod, BotMixer5000 and HPB bot. After that I typed this in 'botmixer5000.cfg':
code:

hpb dlls\HPB_bot.dll
mmm dlls\metamod.dll


and typed in 'liblist.gam' this : 
code:

gamedll "dlls\BotMixer5000"


And... I got monsters and HPB bots on the same server at the same time! And all worked perfectly (although bots didn't shoot at monsters:))!
However, when I tried to do the same thing with PODBots my server crashed! And why?..

You probably need to ask the POD bot author why it crashed.

I didn't think metamod and BoxMixer5000 would work properly together anyway, but what do I know?  ;D

P.S. Make SURE you UNINSTALL BoxMixer5000 (by running the Remove.bat file) before adding or removing bots and then reinstall it (using the Install.bat file) otherwise your server will crash when you try to start it up.

I 
can play with monsters and podbots at the same time!

But since podbot is not metamod plugin i haft to type this in my cstrike shortcut:
+localinfo mm_gamedll podbot/podbot.dll

Mine shortcut look like this:
C:\spel\SIERRA\Half-Life\hl.exe -console -game cstrike +localinfo mm_gamedll podbot/podbot.dll

I dont know if this work whith dedicated server. And i use it with windows mod version
/hope it helped.
P.S Ithe bots ignore the monsters ..

I'm surprised myself that it works with PB :)
Since I couldn't foresee that Botman will ever release such a cool plugin there's no support for shooting monsters in it and I doubt other Bots have it (except for the MultiMod Bots which need to support monsters anyway).
