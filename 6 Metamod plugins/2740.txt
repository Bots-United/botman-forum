Hey botman, most genius one.  How would you go about getting a chicken on a map, I tried this, and it spawns the server without crashing, but no chicken!  Buk Buk!
code:

[add]
PRECACHE_MODEL(models/chick.mdl)
//CHICKEN
{
angles/0 259 0
rendercolor/0 0 0
rendermode/4
framerate/1
model/models/chick.mdl
targetname/chicken1
classname/cycler_sprite
}



I think it might be the model section, BUT if i don't put it that way, it will just not spawn the server, it will just crash.  Help!

Hehe, i've done this on de_dust2

U just forgot the origin numbers.
On de_dust2, set like this:
origin/-932 2501 0

The chicken will be on a crate, find it :)

Chickens are easy to do, just make a hostage, and use the chicken, its cool because they follow you

I have done this before stripper was available, changing the hostage entites to chickens by editing the servers map , but now with stipper its so cool and easy.

Here is an example:

{
   {
      classname/hostage_entity
      angle/0
      model/models/chick.mdl
      skin/0
      origin/-1375 -2504 255
   }
   {

It comes as part of Counter-Strike.  CS is the only MOD that I'm aware of that supports chickens in the game.
