To adjust the strength of the zombie, and monsters in general you need to go to the skill.ccfg file located in the valve directory (or your applicable mod directory).

Look for the following entries:

sk_zombie_health1   "50"
sk_zombie_health2   "50"
sk_health_health2   "100"

The number after 'health' corresponds to the skill level. I'm not sure which skill level is set in multiplayer so I usually tweak them all. Try making them all "100" to start with and test them out yourself. 

Make sure you keep the quotes before and after the number and I have found I must restart the server after changing the entries in skill.cfg.

No, that's only for spawning monsters in Half-Life deathmatch (no other MODs) using the Stripper2 metamod plugin.

For the Monster plugin, I will be adding a "monster_skill.cfg" file that you can use to cusomize the health and damage amounts of monster spawned using the Monster metamod plugin.
