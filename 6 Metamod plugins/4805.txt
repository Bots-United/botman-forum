Is there some way to use BSP tools for DOD maps?

I've been able to use it with some of the older versions of the downloaded DoD MOD map files.

Are you using the retail version of DoD?

No, I am using the MOD version.  I am modifying dod_stuka_v1 to be used on CS with stripper2 just to see if I can do it.  I made it a CS map and it works!!  I am just having a few probs like doors not opening and sandbags being there but not visible.  E-Mail is sent.  Thanks for the help.
