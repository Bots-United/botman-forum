I would like to dynamically add some objects to a running game. I'm wondering if this is possible, I haven't seen it mentioned. If not, you should add some functionality like in the monster plugin, where objects could be spawned near a player. I wouldn't mind setting up a config file with the class/model info if I could spawn it randomly near a player.

Also botman, you should add some code to make your next bot (or HPB bot) shoot monsters, but with a lesser priproty than other players. The feture could be optional if some people don't like it. It's sad when I spawn zombies all around a bot and it doesnt shoot its way out. ;(

As long as they are precached at the point where the map is loaded (before any player joins), you can add those entities at anytime during the game (like the Monster plugin does).  I would image there's some AdminMOD AMX plugins that allow you to do this.

About the HPB bot, there won't be any additional features added or any bugs fixed.  I just don't have the time to work on it anymore.  I do plan on updating it to work with the next Half-Life/TFC/Counter-Strike client update once that's available (assuming it comes out sometime this year), but no feature additions will be made and no bugs will be fixed.
