do you recognize this server error


sv_getspace: overflow on messagebegin/end

Nope.  That one I haven't seen before.

From the error message it sounds like something is starting to send a network packet and overflowing the defined size of that network message (you have to tell the engine how big each network message will be when it's declared).

If you're running a new MOD, it could be a bug in the MOD code.  If you running an old existing MOD, it could be a custom metamod plugin causing this.

If you changed anything recently try backing that out and see if the message goes away.  :D

The error sounds very familier, I thought it was an adminmod error? But searching google/amod and these forums I can't find anything about it. :-\.

Ask on the NS forum.  I suspect that since it's a new version of the MOD, it still has some bugs.

There's probably other people that have reported this too, so search the forum BEFORE you post a message there.  :)
