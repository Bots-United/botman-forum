You can't.  At least, I haven't found a way to do this.  This same problem popped up when trying to implement spray logos for bots.  There isn't any way to load a custom decal (bitmap) and "spray" that as a permanent decal.

For things like models, sprites, and sounds, you PRECACHE the file before it's actually used.  The Half-Life engine keeps a list of the things that were precached and will download those items to the client if the client doesn't already have them.  This is how you can create custom models, sprites or sounds and have them show up on the client's display when they connect to your server.

Decals are different.  There is no function in the Half-Life engine to precache decals.  Decals are loaded from the decals.wad file and they are referenced by an index (the position of that decal in the .wad file).  When you spray decal #45, everyone will see the same thing because they already have this decal in the client's version of decals.wad.  If you add a custom decal to the server's decals.wad file, the clients WILL NOT have this decal and will see NOTHING if this decal is displayed.  The only way you can get clients to see your custom decals is if you force them to download your server's version of decals.wad (and replace the one on the client).  If every server did this, every time you connected to a server you'd have to download a new decals.wad file because the one on the client's machine wouldn't match the one on the server.

If you want to customize your server with some artwork, I suggest using a custom model, or custom sprite instead of trying to spray a custom decal.  There is an example of using a custom sprite called "botman.spr" in the example configuration file for the map crossfire.

Yeah, but if cl_allow_download set to 0 at the client-side, players not able to download the custom sprite, and they cannot join the server without it.
I know lots of people who keep it 0, because of lame admins with admin-mod sounds plugin...

Oh yeah, 1 question: there are the HUD-sprites. Can i split that up somehow (cut out the numbers an icons etc)? I didn't find a way, maybe this handled by the mod.

If you can find a tool to export the bitmap images inside a sprite to .bmp files then you can edit these, create a new bitmap of your own, then use the Sprite Wizard on Wavelength to create a new sprite which you can then place in the sprites folder.
