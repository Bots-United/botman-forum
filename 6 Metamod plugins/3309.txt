it doesn't seen to be working.  I am running this on a linux CS server.  I have everything working but i cant seem to change the health of the monsters.  I have tryed setting it to -50, 1, 100, and 1000000.  I have also tryed changing the skills.cfg in the valve dir.  No matter what I do i have issues getting it to work with a "shoot more than once" life level.  Is there anything i can do to change maybe recompile the plugin to allow more heath for the monsters?  or is the monster_skill.cfg pose to work under cs and i am doing something worng.

Did you copy the monster_skill.cfg file to the MOD directory (i.e. valve\monster_skill.cfg, tfc\monster_skill.cfg, cstrike\monster_skill.cfg, etc.) or are you modifying the one in the monster_plugin directory?  If you don't have one in the MOD directory then the monster code will use default values for health and damage.

Yes i copied the file over the the root of the cstrike directory.  I also changed the values in the file to see if it was working.  No matter what i changed it to it took only 1 hit from any gun to kill the emenyz.  Is there a was to change the default values?  The plugin know its in the right directory, as i see the plugin load it shows the right directory for the mod and the file is there and i have tryed "de-gheying"  it, aka the win32-linux vb script and using it un altered from the zip file.  For some reason it doesn't act like it even sees the files.  I have tryed outputing logs and it doesn't show me anything i would think a problem.  Does the cfg work under linux?

Geeez!  20 bullet damage!  Your players must not survive for more than 2 or 3 seconds next to a human grunt with a machine gun!  ;D

P.S. If you turn logging on for your server (add "+log on" to the command line when starting your server), you will see this in the .log file (found in the MOD's logs directory) when the monster_skill.cfg is processed...
code:
L 06/20/2002 - 08:37:43: [MONSTER] Processing monster skill file=/usr/hlds_l/tfc/monster_skill.cfg

...if you have the monster_skill.cfg file located in the MOD directory (in this case "tfc").

Do you have the right owner and permissions on the file?

Some of the classes in TFC seem to survive long enough to duck/cover/kill. I'm running a special event on my hunted-only server for a couple of hours later today with hgrunts/apaches/hassassins and a sprinkling of monsters generated on the fly. We'll see if the peeps are spanked soundly or are able to adjust. :)

Ahhh it was a success! Picture this:

Building One roof. Two snipers armed with crowbars running in circles trying to kill 5 or 10 snarks.
