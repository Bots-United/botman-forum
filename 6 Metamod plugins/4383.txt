There isn't one that I have done, but other people have added other various monsters.  Search this forum for the monsters you are looking for (for example the "garg") and you'll find posts from people who were trying to add those monsters to my Monster plugin.

These people may or may not make those changes available to you (it's completely up to them whether they do that or not since the GPL only applies if you are distributing the executable for other people to download, it doesn't say anything about keeping things private that you've added yourself and only make available to yourself).

It is also possible that the servers are using Botman's Stripper2 program. I am running "Monster DM" dedicated server with monsters using only Stripper2 and not the Monster Plugin.

But that will only work for Half-Life deathmatch.  It won't work in any other MOD (except OpFor and Sven-Coop).

The answer is very simple, Stripper cannot spawn any alive human grunts in CS. It can only set models of the grunts.

For alive models you need the monster-plugin.

well monstermod crashes CS but someone has used stripper to put Human Grunts to guard a bomb zone no crashes.

...you just have to make sure you're not tring to precache ALL of the monsters at once since this can crash the client with the "out of sfx_t" error message.
