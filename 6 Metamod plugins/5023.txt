I know that stripper2 allows the removal of the guass gun but I don't want to remove it. I just want to remove the ability to guass jump. There used to be a server called Xtian's where he disabled guass jumping and shooting through walls. I've been trying to figure out how he did that. Does stripper2 have the ability to stop guass jumping without removing the weapon?

stripper 2 cannot do this, there may be special plugins for metamod that allow it.
