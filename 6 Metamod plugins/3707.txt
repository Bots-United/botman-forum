That entity is supposed to produce another light entity when linked with it in terms of distance with a targetname. The player approaches the entity which produces a light, and when the player draws near it withdraws like a turtle and extinguishes its light. 

I dumped a funtioning entity in a DM map with bsp_tool and attempted to reproduce it with no success. The xen_plantlight appears without the accompanying light. 

Anyone had any sucess with it at all or am I wasting my time?

Also has anyone added any type of light at all with stripper2? If so, what kind?

My experience with the xen_plantlight entity ranges from bad to worse.  At times the light works as it's should for a short period of time then it can be no longer seen on the plant tip but rather somewhere off in a random area of the map.  Yes that's right, look around and you'll find a glowing light up in the sky that is nowhere near the xen palnts but is clearly the the xen light; the light for some reason migrates to this point.  Other times there is never xen light displayed at any time by the xens, in the sky, or otherwise.

I don't know why this is so as they seem to work when they are included as part of a bsp rather than when they are added later to an already completed bsp via stripper2 or zonertools.

How about just a normal light? Can you produce one and get it to stay where it's told?

Every time I've ever treid to edit light levels in a map it hasn't worked. And when I did get it to work, people would have to download a new map.

Light is compiled into the map seperate from the CGS compile. CGS is the only thing you can recompile into a map without creating a unique BSP.

Good luck with lights :). I have no idea how NEOTF can do it on the fly :-\

The lights for HL, if you want to test them, are:

{
"classname" "light"
"target" "light1"
"_light" "255 255 128 200"
"origin" "0 0 0"
}
{
"classname" "info_target"
"targetname" "light1"
"origin" "128 16 0"
}
{
"classname" "light_spot"
"angles" "0 0 0"
"_light" "255 255 128 200"
"targetname" "light1"
"_cone" "30"
"_cone2" "45"
"origin" "0 0 -128"
}
{
"classname" "light_environment"
"angles" "0 0 0"
"_light" "255 255 128 200"
"origin" "0 0 128"
}

If you create lights through code (i.e. a plugin that is designed to create lights), you can create temporary entities for the lights (for example a TE_DLIGHT can be used to create a temporary dynamic light), but creating temporary lights adds quite a bit to the network bandwidth and can create considerable lag.
