I'm dredging an old subject, but I'm in the code again and I'm stymied.

For direct weapon damage against monsters(shotgun, knife, even direct-hit RPGSs), CMBaseMonster::TakeDamage() gets the correct  pevInflictor and pevAttacker.

For radius weapons... grenades, RPG explosions, etc, it does not. It seems to get the pev of whoever is in slot 1.

Why does this get confused? How does the game itself determine radius damage inflictors? Could TFC have bastardized the code so badly that TakeDamage does not function as expected when dealing with radius damage?

Thanks (again)
