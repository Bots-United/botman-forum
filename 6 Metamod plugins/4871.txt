Tell me how to work Metamod. Because I cannot work anything such as Monstermod. I did read readme and still doesn't work

this is not a metamod support forum I'm sure, botman rights metamod plugins but im sure he doesn't wish to provide metamod support, try their site http://www.metamod.org 

But if you followed the readme you should be able to get it working no prob... What specifically are you having problems with? Is this windows or linux? Details man details...
