hello there, i am working on a half-life ( or virtually any mod ) weapon adder but i havnt compiled anything yet. how hard do you think it would be to make a weapon adder? You could use existing weapons from tfc, counter-strike, or something like that. all you have to do is program a weapon in the plugin dll to mimic another weapon. sound interesting?

The biggest problem will be getting the client.dll to display something other than the weapons that the MOD supports (you can swap one weapon model for another, but you can't easily add new weapon slots or weapon positions in the slots for new weapons).

If you're goal is to simply replace an existing weapon with something else, you might be able to get that to work.  If your goal is to add brand new weapons to the HUD and not remove any weapons that are already there, I don't think it's possible.

As I understand it, it has already been done by Rob Harwood of GirlPower, and also by the NEOTF team.  Not a 'weapon adder' but they have added new weapons to TFC.

Yea I thought Adminop (Rob Harwood's project) did this? Only problem with Adminop and NEOTF is that I won't touch those servers with a 10ft poll :).

Why not Lunatic With Candy, I am an admin on a very nice NEOTF server?

AutoOP not AdminOP, dont get it confused with the clones.

And I have been working on this quite recently and have pretty much got "fake" weapons as good as they can get. I will be testing this stuff over the next few days so if you pop into GP2 you can try it out. I managed to port many OP4 weapons, and the Egon gun to TFC, the only difference is there is no client prediction on them (this is impossible with a server hook).

Rob, if only you made your wonderful modifactions available to the public free of strings attached; that would be a great thing for tfc. Frankly, to charge for a release of your product is probably a violation of your licence agreement with Valve.  Might want to contact an IP attorney.

I don't like NEOTF as it seems to attract idiots.

Yours is the exception :P, you're not a 14 year old with hormone problem :D.

I like TFC the way it is, I enjoy novelty to an extent (e.g. adding things to play with to maps) but when it comes to things that change the face of the game, I'm never happy with them (be it NeoTF or and HL patch :P).

I'd probably play on your server more if it wasn't for my ping (how can I live 50~ from a server and ping 70ish... when a server 1200 miles away I get 30s >:(? Stupid Minnesota pipes). Speaking of pipes, I did a trace rout to your server; found that my connection is routed from Minneapolis, to Chicago, back to Minneapolis with about 6 hops between each.

How so?  The server I admin on has one of the nicest group of players I've seen in TFC.  In addition, the NEOTF team does a lot of good work creating a fun product and for unfettered distribution.  Not sure why you'd want to put them down.  Maybe shouldn't generalize so much.

Technincally the whole sell for money thing isnt going to happen, it started out as a joke when some llama started asking me for it, the price someone would have to pay me to sit and write a mod for them would be so high it aint gonna happen.

AutoOP:Shodan is the only thing I havnent released, things like CS-CTF, Spraywit, HLHook etc are all free and open source under GPL. And I plan on releasing a free version of AutoOP:Shiver, once its at a releaseable stage (without sourcecode, however - too easy for llama to rip it off). However Shiver includes the ability for users to create their own plugins in C/C++ and is very open ended so even those that like to get into the code can have a good time, some of the base Shiver stuff, like map voting etc. will be in plugins and open source so users have a sort of SDK to work with.

Every NEOTF server I have ever been on (aside from ACWO's) has made me loath my existence.

But I'm not going to argue anymore as I really don't care :). If I'm wrong, good for me, but it's not like I'm insulting you're entire existence; it's a video game.

I may have some demos lying about that will show you why I despise NEOTF whole heartedly. I usually record demos of idiots I find, not sure why, it’s just something I do.

Per capita, I’ve found more people worth banning on 1 NEOTF server then on the servers that I admin on.

SOC has been up for almost a year now and our ban list is only 108 (perma ban) people long, while in the 2 months that we’ve had HLStats up we’ve recorded 2875 unique players (HLStats on 3 servers, http://hlstats.getangry.org ).

I'd imgine not, otherwise you'd be open to liability from Valve.  However, reading your forums makes it seem like you're actually thinking about charging.  Seems like a silly proposition.  Dispite that nonsense you do great work Rob.  Hope it's available soon.

if the price was right, I'd write a MOD for anyone, I would not break any licenses (afaik) by people paying me to write a MOD for them as its my time they are buying.

um Mr Rob, your forum doesn't just slightly imply that you are selling it but it implies it very heavily..... 

look at your thread saying 'trial AutoOP Shodan for 20 days'

http://gpforums.girlpower.dhs.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?s=3e2a440c0340ffff;act=ST;f=5;t=186

you might want to be careful there, even though you don't actually say you are charging money for it, an attourney can turn an implication into a full admittance. just be careful :)

New weapons arnt to hard to make, ive made a new gun for TFC also. Flipside uses the HPB Bot source code(well, Neotf source code which is off of HPB).

depends on the quality of the fake weapons as to the difficulty to produce.
