Did you attempt to manually unload the Stripper2 plugin?  Stripper2 doesn't support the metamod feature of dynamically loading and unloading plugins (there's no need for it too since it doesn't do anything once the map is up and running).

I'm not sure if the "for reason 'server command'" was because you tried to unload it or not, but you can ignore the 'interface version didn't match" warning.  That's not a problem.  Metamod is just telling you that Stripper2 wasn't compiled with the latest version of metamod and you might want to look for an update.  There isn't an update because an update isn't necessary for Stripper2 to work properly.
