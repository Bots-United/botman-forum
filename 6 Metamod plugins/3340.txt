hey i run a DMC low grav server <-=-*Free_Fall*-=-> 12.229.217.103 , all custom maps, on a linux 7.3 box, love the monster plugin but it seems to crash the server at odd times, i have so far just used it to spawn monsters at players, no map config files yet. i have the latest metamod etc and allowmonsters is set up right. sometimes i can spawn many monsters in a row with no problem sometimes it crashes the first time i use it. here's the error. line 83: 2768 segmentation fault $HL $*, any ideas? thanks                   <-=F=-*DiVeBoMbeR*-=F=->

I haven't tested the Monster plugin with DMC, DoD, FrontlineForce, Firearms, The Opera, Action Half-Life, and many other MODs.  It may crash on these until I've had a chance to test the plugin out on those MODs (and it may still crash even after I've tested it if I can't fix the problem).

ok, thanks
fyi, i noticed that when the models load at map change on the server consol, the hvr.mdl comes up in caps ie: HVR.mdl, and in the pak0.pak it is lower case, is this a problem? also i seem to be able to spawn monsters anyplace using the map specific files but with the spawn at player feature i can only spawn them when the player is on the floor. this is not a probelm with most people but on a low grav server people are in the air most of the time, lol, if they are in the air it says there's not enough room for the monster.
thanks for replying i'm sure you are very busy    <-=-F-=-*DiVeBoMbeR*-=F-=->

FYI2, well after much experimenting and many
crashes i found a few things that may help narrow down the DMC linux crash problem. I disabled all the plugins that i run except the monster plugin and it works pretty well, i can spawn tons of monsters all is cool, except once i reach a certain ammount of monsters, pretty big number i lost track, the server will crash. say i can spawn 150 monsters dosen't seem to matter if i do them all in one map or spread them out between 20 maps after i get to that number it crashes. also, i reenabled all the plugins one at a time and found that the one that is causing the conflict is plugin_spawn, cool plugin botman, love it, hope this helps in some small way to find the problem
Thanks

ok, here's what the gdb stack dump says

program terminated with signal 11, segmentation fault.

cannot access memory at address 0x400136c0

#0  0x4130350f in ?? ()
gdb where
#0 0x 4130350f in ?? ()
cannot access memory at address 0xdffff468

funny thing is i can spawn monsters a ton on the lan but if someone is on from the net it will crash almost instantly, i installed stripp2 and precashed some of the models everyone suggested, helped a bit.
thanks
