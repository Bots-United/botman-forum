Decals "sprayed" from the decals.wad file will be whatever color the last index of the palette for that decal (index=255).  Use Wally to look at the decals in the decals.wad file, double click on one of the decals and look at the color for index 255 in the palette.  That's what color it will be.  You can change the color of the bitmap in the wad lump, save it on your machine, and you will see the changed color, everyone else that plays on your server will see the default color (since that's what they've got in their decals.wad file).

According to Wally, the big numbers are yellow, the letters are orange, and the little numbers are black.
