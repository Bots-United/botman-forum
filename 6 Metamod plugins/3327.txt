When I try to start a game with the monster plugin I get an error saying ...
"Host_error: PF_precache_model_l:'sprites/xspark4.spr' overflow

Any ideas about a workaround or fix?

Oh, silly me, it's Firearms RC 2.6, and I am running the latest HL patch (if you hadn't guessed already :D )

I haven't had a chance to test the Monster plugin with anything except Half-Life deathmatch, TFC and Counter-Strike.

I had reports of problems with it not working in DoD.  I'm sure other MODs will have problems with it also.  I'll try and get it working with DoD, Firearms and Frontline Force in the next week or two.
