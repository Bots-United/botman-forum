I want to list the entities for a particular single player map, C4A1A. Where are the single player maps located and is there a way to list the entities using Botman's BSP_Tool

Thanks,

The single player files are in a .pak file. Go to www.fileplanet.com and search for pak explorer.

I'm sure you can use botman's program to get the entites out of a map. Just extract the map to a folder or something and open it up with that.

Actually you don't need to extract it before running the BSP_tool.exe on it (the tool knows how to read things from PAK files).

You DO have to know the name of it before hand though.  Like Chet said, download pakscape, pakexplorer or any other PAK tool that can read Half-Life PAK files to view the contents of the PAK file.

NOTE: You will need to close the pak tool when using the BSP_tool otherwise the PAK file will be locked and BSP_tool won't be able to open it.

I have looked into the pak file using the HLMV and found the map, C4A1A and put the pak file in  the same directory as bsp_tool.exe but when I ran it I did the following:

bsp_tool -ent c4a1a.bsp >c4a1a.txt

but bsp_tool came back and said it couldn't find the map...if I am trying to read it within a pak file should there be other parameters?

Nevermind...I moved the pak file where it is supposed to be and it worked fine.
