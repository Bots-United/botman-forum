Well I would try this out, but my server's motherboard had a static encounter last night (I believe - wont respond lights turn on) :(.

This is what I was trying to get at in my last post, but for some reason was unable to explain as basic as it is.

[strip]
whatever...

[add]
{
 exec/2fort_hunted_str.cfg
} 25
{
 exec/2fort_sniper_str.cfg
} 25
{
 exec/2fort_norm_str.cfg
} 50

So this is sort of wishful thinking isn't it? :)

The only problem with that is that it might execute all of those files so you'd have to counter the other files by stripping the entities added by those other config files... hmmm, might need to boost server memory :D.
