I just installed the monster plug-in and I have to say I love it.  It really helps with the damn campers on our CS server.  But I think we have a problem.  After the first map it seemed to be fine, but on the second map, people started randomly crashing out with strange errors in their consoles (I am working on getting the errors).  Once I disabled monster plugin all seemed fine.  Has anyone else had any issues?  We are running it on a CS 1.5 server on Redhat 7.2.  As soon as I get some more information I'll post it here.  Thanks

Players getting dropped are getting this error:

s_findname: out of sfx_t


Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks

Perhaps you are spawning too many monsters in that map.  Some maps are bigger than other and contain more entities.  If you are spawning more than just a few monsters, try reducing the number of spawn points to 5 or 10 and see if that takes care of it.

Actully, I am not spawning any monsters.  I just have the plugin loaded.  The only way I spawn monsters is when I need them to attack a camper :)  (Thx for the plugin btw).  So I did a test, I restarted the server with monster in and did not spawn any monsters, and sure enough 15-45 mins in, people started crashing out with that error.  The only plugins I am running are adminmod, statsme and monsters.  Any ideas to try?

   Thanks,
   CF

Nope.  Just make sure you are running the latest metamod (1.12.02, I think) and the latest StatsMe.

You might also want to try without StatsMe (but with the Monster plugin) for a couple of hours to see if there's some kind of interaction going on between the two.  I don't use StatsMe, so I don't know if it causes problems for Monster or not.  Also some maps may give you problems even if no monsters get spawned because the Monster plugin will still try to precache all the monsters so that they are available when you try to spawn them.

Maybe I'll change that so that the monsters only get precached right before you try to spawn them so that if you don't use any of them, they won't take up any memory on the server.

The "out of sfx_t" thing is an indication of running out of entities on the client to handle rendering of effects (like smoke or fireballs from grenades, etc.).  If there aren't any monsters being spawned in the level, then they won't be sending out any effects to the clients.  I'm not sure what might be going on with your server.  As far as I know, nobody else has reported this specific problem (that doesn't mean nobody else has it, it's just that nobody else has reported it).

Is it ONLY in cs_italy and not other maps?  Perhaps cs_italy is too big run also run the moster plugin with.

doesn't out of sfx_t error also occur when you precahc too many sounds? Cos I think its happend with my bot a lot when I precahced lots of sounds, but I hardly get the error anymore after removing a lot of them being precached.

If I remember right out of sfx_t comes when you have too many sounds precached

I am having the same problem and it is frustrating the buggers out of me. My other admins and myself LOVE this plugin. It is absolute comedy to release 4 or 5 monsters on some poor unsuspecting camper. The problem is all of my players (including myself) end up crashing at some point with the same error SFX message that was given above.
We run a CS server, pretty much all dust (a pretty large map) with adminmod, logd, statsme, and chickenmod. One interesting note is that players continued to crash after I used the meta unload command to kill the monster plugin.

PLEASE, somebody find an answer to this one because I really want to use the monster plugin but I am not willing to sacrafice statsme or the other plugins my players love.

Thanx for writing such an awsome plugin Botman.

The only way about this (I think) Is by limiting the amount of sounds the monsters can make, perhaps all the IDLE stuff could be taken out.

The next release of the Monster plugin will only precache sounds for the monsters that you will actually spawn in that level.  If you only want to drop an occasional snark on a player and don't want to spawn anything else, the only sounds that will be precahced are snark sounds.

The Monster 3.00.00 release should be out within a week.

how do you take out precached things

You can't "take them out" once they've been precached.  You just don't precache them in the first place.

it took me a while but hopefully this resolves the issues i was having with *random* crashes on my server due to "S_FindName: outof sfx_t"

...and if you had read the ReadMe.txt file that comes with the Monster plugin, you would have found...

"WARNING: Precaching too many monsters can cause problems in some MODs!  Each monster has models and sounds that are required by the monster and these models and sounds take up memory on the server and memory on the client.  If clients are crashing and seeing the error message "S_Findname: Out of sfx_t", then you are precaching too many monsters on the server."
