i just got this plugin and i like it a lot! However, i need help with spawning a light. I have tried a xen light , do i need a sprite with that? because when i spawn it it does not make light. Are there any other lights that might be better ? I am putting a light in a dark room that i found on a map. thank you, oddmanout.

All I need for a xen_planetlight is:

origin/0 0 0
classname/xen_planetlight

Always works fine for me.

Make SURE that the MOD you are trying to spawn it in supports a xen_planetlight entity.  Some MODs may not support xen entities.  Run the "entities.exe" application and select the dll from the MOD's dlls folder to see if the xen_plantlight entity is supported in that MOD.

i am using half-life dm with admin mod and metamod. the planetlight actually spawns but doesnt make light. I was wondering also, are there any other lights that are possible? Because i kind of need a light that doesnt go off when you get near it. thx, oddmanout.

Look at some of the Half-Life mapping tutorial websites on how to add lights.  planethalflife.com/wavelength and www.valve-erc.com are 2 of them.

im sorry i dont mean to be a pain in the ass but ive looked on those sites and i dont quite understand the light entity. I ahve tried spawning it using the different settings of brightness and everything however it doesnt seem to work. All I need is a simple light to light up a little room i found.
