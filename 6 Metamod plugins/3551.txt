Try clicking on the link several times (refresh probably won't work).  Sometimes you hit a fileplanet server that doesn't have the file on it.  Clicking the link again (or three or four times) will usually get you to a server that has the file.  Also if you are running any download managers like GetRight or Gozilla, turn them off first.

Alternately, wait a day or two and try fileplanet again.
