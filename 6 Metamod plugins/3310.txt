Is there any way to put a sprite on a flat wall without it floating and rotating or is this just the nature of a sprite. I tried to put one in the rats map but instead of being flat againt the wall it was half sticking out at a 90% angle.

This is the code i used:
{
   classname/env_sprite
   PRECACHE_SPRITE(sprites/Logomac8.spr)
   frame/1
   framerate/10
   rendermode/5
   renderamt/255
   scale/1.00
   spawnflags/1  // SF_SPRITE_STARTON
   model/sprites/Logomac8.spr
   origin/192 511 640
}
Thanks Mac

Sprites ALWAYS face the player.  You can't do anything about this since it happens in the Half-Life rendering engine.
