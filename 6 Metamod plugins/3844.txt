hi

(monster plungin)
i cant believe, but i cant find a thread asking
how to limit the number of monsters that reapawn.

i hope this is right:
the plugin spawns monsters randomly, as they are
located in the .cfg

but it does not stop spawning when 4 monsters
have spawned ?

{
monster1
.
.
.
monster4
)

if there is a possibility to limit the amount of monsters that respawn,
please tell me,
if i was to stupid to find the right line in the manual, sorry sorry sorry

You will get 1 monster at a time for each monster group (the stuff between the '{' and '}').

If you have 4 monster groups you will have 4 monsters in the level.  If you have 20 monster groups you will have 20 monsters in the level.

If you want to limit the number of monsters in a level, you have to delete some of the monster groups from the monster .cfg file for that map.

For each monster group, another monster will not be added to the level until the previous monster is killed (i.e. if you have a monster group where you are respawning a scientist, an hgrunt, and a headcrab, with a 10 second respawn delay, it won't keep spawning a monster every 10 seconds, it will only spawn a monster 10 seconds after the previous monster was killed).

hi

im not sure that you understand my problem
i try to explain it better

i want to have only 2 monster in the map

so i made a cfg and wrote
{
origin/-4 -510 36
delay/1
monster/barney
monster/barney
}

what happens is that the monster appears, i gets killed, and then it appears again,ever and ever again (not sure but think this is called respawn) 

i want to limit the amount of respawns
so that the monsters appear until a limit is reached
and then they shouldnt respawn again

hope this you can understan me
not sure that my translation is ok (im german)

ok, here a cfg for the total understanding
{
origin a b c
monster x , delay x , number_of_respawns_allowed x
monster y , delay y , number_of_respawns_allowed y
...
...
absolut_nuber_of_respawns_for_this_monstergroup x
}

so you can be sure that perhaps an apache does not appear to often, an makes it too hard to play
and you can be sure that after perhaps 5 monsters its over at this place
(if you get 5 scientists - luck, if you get 5 assasins - bad luck :)

You can't limit the number of times a monster is respawned when using the Monster plugin.

If you only want the monster to respawn once (in Half-Life deathmatch), use "mp_allowmonsters 1" to allow monsters to be spawned and use my Stripper2 plugin to add monsters to the map.  Monsters will only spawn once and when killed will not respawn.

Search this forum for "allowmonsters" to find threads related to this.
