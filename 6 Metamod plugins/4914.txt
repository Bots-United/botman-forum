I have the EXACT same problem. What did you do exactly to fix it?

I know he said he had files in the wrong folder. But which files and where did they need to be? I have went over this thing several times. I can't figure out what I put in the wrong place.

It would be a great help if you explained your problem and how you fixed it, as I am sure you know from the lack of response that you received.

stripper2 goes into mod dlls folder (RTFM)

(sorry I gave the folder for the source files earlier not the release program!)

I thought newer versions of metamod wanted all plugins to be in the "addons" folder?

...and like Cheesy said, read the docs in the doc\txt or doc\html folder for details on where metamod expects it's files to be.

You actually don't need them to be in the addons folder.

You can if you coded your plugin to look there (for its configs etc), but for things like my bot, too, uses itself as a metamod plugin but is installed in HL folder, and as long as metmod points to its dll properly then it will work.
