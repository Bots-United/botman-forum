Did you modify liblist.gam to load metamod.dll (or metamod_i386.so) instead of the default game DLL?

I'm running a HLDS version 1.1.1.0 at 217.118.46.201:27016 and Stripper2 is working fine as far as I can tell.

Kind regards,

JMH

Sorry guys. I run a remote game server by Recon Gamer. When they did the update, they set my metamod.ini file back to default. Sorry for the ignorant post. LOL! I guess I jumped to conclusions.
