To create a team, just give them spawn points, has nothing to do with the info_tfdetect.

If you want teams named like Blue, red or whatever it usually is, remove this lines from your code:

 "team4_name" "green_team"
"team3_name" "yellow_team"
"team2_name" "red_team"
"team1_name" "blue_team"


I recommend you to do this to original tf_detect.


To add sniper only team:

Classes are limited with

maxammo_shells - blue team
maxammo_nails - red team
maxammo_rockets - yellow team
maxammo_cells - green team



+1 No Scout  +2 No Sniper  +4 No Soldier  +8 No Demo Man  +16 No Combat Medic  +32 No Heavy Weapons Guy  +64 No Pyro  +128 No Random Playerclass  +256 No Spy  +512 No Engineer   Setting this field to -1 forces the Blue Team to be Civilian only.


If you want to have sniper only, you would have to count 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512 = 1021 (if i counted it right)

So you would have to add this line to your tf_detect if you want to yellow team to be sniper only: maxammo_rockets 1021 and green team maxammo_cells 1021 .



How to limit how much players can join to team:

ammo_medikit - blue team
ammo_detpack - red team
maxammo_medikit - yellow team
maxammo_detpack - green team

Use 0 to have no limit or number how many you want it max. have.

Example: 
ammo_medikit 0      <-- not limited
ammo_detpack 2      <-- only 2 players can play in this team at same time.



>Everything goes to tf_detect<

I hope that helped you a bit.
