I would really like it if oyu could allow us to make a skill.cfg in the mod folder using the plugin to define the monster's various skills. Here is some example code that would be in the skill.cfg

// MONSTERS

// Alien Grunt
sk_agrunt_health1      "100"
sk_agrunt_health2      "150"
sk_agrunt_health3      "100"

sk_agrunt_dmg_punch1      "15"
sk_agrunt_dmg_punch2      "20"
sk_agrunt_dmg_punch3      "40"

This will allow more control over the game, and monsters! As it is now, 1 shot from a glock in counter strike will kill jus about any monster, so that needs to be fixed, and this is just the way in my opinion. Please look into this.

PS. great idea for a plugin

Yes, I am going to allow the health and damage amounts of the monsters to be configurable at some point.
