Hey all, I have the apache set to move around boot_camp. It touches all four path corners set for it, but the problem is that is putt putts along like a damn snail! I was wanting it to zip along like Ive seen it do in other map configs. What could be the problem? Here is the config if anyone would be so kind as to copy and paste this and try it out:

[add]

{ //APACHE ROUTINE 
classname/monster_apache 
angle/180 
spawnflags/8 //16=friendly 8=hostile 
target/ap1 //first path_corner targetname 
TriggerTarget/event1 
origin/1932 655 660
} 
//PATH CORNERS FOR APACHE 
{ 
classname/path_corner 
angles/180
targetname/ap1 
target/ap2 //next path_corner 
origin/2328 577 660
} 
{ 
classname/path_corner 
angles/180 
targetname/ap2 
target/ap3 
origin/2383 -1171 660 
} 
{ 
classname/path_corner 
angles/180 
targetname/ap3 
target/ap4 
origin/-1172 -945 660 
} 
{ 
classname/path_corner 
angles/180 
targetname/ap4 
target/ap1 //back to first path_corner 
origin/-2142 1752 660 
} 

What Im hearing is that the clip is too low in the map which is hindering the chopper. Hmm.
