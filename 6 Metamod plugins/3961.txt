is there a way to add a sound to a teleporter... so when you step into it, it will trigger a wav file?

Maybe trigger a multimanager and have the multimanager trigger the sound?

I remember some of the Half-Life single player maps had teleporters that played a sound when you entered them (or it may have been that you triggered the sound when you arrived at the destination).

Try dumping the entities from some of the single player maps, or looking on Half-Life mapping tutorial websites for teleporter examples.

Alternately, you can have the player drop through a trigger after they come out of the teleporter destination and have that play the sound.  See the "evil weaponstrip teleporter" in the Stripper2 .cfg file for crossfire as an example.

It can be done because Ive done it. I will look for my config if youre still having problems. It was a little tricky as I recall but doable. If I remember correctly I had to play the sound at the teleport destination for it to be heard. There was a slight delay though between entering the teleporter and hearing the sound due to the nature of whats happening. The teleport destination was also outside the normal bounds of the map so that may have affected it.
