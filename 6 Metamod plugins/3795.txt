Subject: Need help with metamod & monster plugin
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Can someone teach me step by step to setup metamod and monster plugin for HLDM? (I've screwed my CS & TFC when setting up metamod & monster plugin). The metamod.dll.zip can't be downloaded from the website, my download manger just idle and nothing happens, someone upload the metamod.dll for me?

I'm not sure with the commands for loading the plugin, can someone kind show me the list of commands to load and spawn the monsters? 

Anyone who have ready made <map>_monster.cfg files do show me some examples.

I'm using CS Retail Version, using POD Bot for CS, FoxBot for TFC and Botman's Bot for HLDM. I've tried adding bot but it says unknown command, tell me how can i add bots and spawn monsters(i don't know the commands).

My CS directory:
D:\Program Files\Valve\Counter-Strike\cstrike
My TFC directory:
D:\Program Files\Valve\Counter-Strike\tfc
My HLDM directory:
D:\Program Files\Valve\Counter-Strike\hldm

*I know when you guys sees this thread you will tell me to read the ReadMe.txt and yes i did. I did read it and try out using TFC & CS but both went wrong and messed up. Yes... i know i'm retarded, stupid, not as pro as you guys and i really need help with this it's kind of too complicated for me...

Thanks in advance for those who is willing to help...

RTFM.  Read the ReadMe.txt file included with the Monster plugin.

is explaining the steps so hard for you?

YES! i know! ReadMe.txt! If i had successfully did it by following the instructions in ReadMe.txt, i wouldn't have come to the forum asking for help. I know you're a busy man, helping me out by telling those steps only takes less than 10mins of your time...

telling others to do what they have already done is not helping at all

I don't see how this possibly can be so hard for you.

Install metamod.

Open metamod.ini

Add "win32 dlls/monster_mm.dll"

Our server's metamod.ini file looks like this (just to give you an example of how to set yours up):

win32 dlls/admin_MM.dll
win32 dlls/logmod_mm_i386.dll
//win32 addons/statsme/dlls/sm_tfc_mm.dll
win32 dlls/stripper2_mm.dll
win32 dlls/monster_mm.dll

Next, unzip monster_mm.dll into "D:\Program Files\Valve\Counter-Strike\<tfc\hldm\cstrike>\Dlls\"
Unzip the map files to "D:\Program Files\Valve\Counter-Strike\<tfc\hldm\cstrike>\Maps\"

Unzip monster_precache.cfg and monster_skill.cfg to "D:\Program Files\Valve\Counter-Strike\<tfc\hldm\cstrike>"

Open up monster_precache.cfg and select which monsters you wish to load. Our's looks like this:

agrunt
apache
barney
bigmomma
bullsquid
//gargantua - not supported yet
hassassin
headcrab
hgrunt
houndeye
islave
//icthyosaur - not supported yet
//leech - not supported yet
controller
//nihilanth - not supported yet
scientist
snark
zombie

The more monsters you have it precache the more CPU resources it will take up. Make sure you have a fast computer before precaching every possible monster.

ahh~! Thanks Lunatic, that's what i call detailed explanations. How about loading bots(playing with bots and monsters) and commands for spawning monsters (or is it just auto spawn without setting anything, since i only copy and paste the files)?

How about the liblist.gam file?
This is my TFC's liblist.gam:

// Team Fortress Classes Game .dll Listing File
// Edited by FoxBot v0.695 Installer
game "Team Fortress"
url_info "www.teamfortressclassic.com"
url_dl ""
version "1.5"
size "37000000"
svonly "0"
cldll "0"
type "multiplayer_only"
nomodels "1"
mpentity "info_tfdetect"
gamedll "..\FoxBot\FoxBot.dll"

I've tried commented out gamedll "..\FoxBot\FoxBot.dll" and add
gamedll "dlls\metamod.dll" then when i created a server it says: 

Initializing Tracker...
Tracker Error : TrackerUI.dll invalid, not loading

This error make me cannot create bot nor spawn monsters.

Thanks again Lunatic, now i understand much better (^_^)

You'll need to add "+localinfo" with the path to the FOX bot .dll file.  See this thread for an example using HPB_bot.dll for the HPB bot (replace the dlls/HPB_bot.dll part with the path and filename for the Fox bot DLL file).

http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=1&action=display&num=3318

The liblist.gam file "gamedll" entry should load "dlls\metamod.dll".  Metamod will use the "+localinfo" argument to load additional DLLs (see the metamod documentation for details).

"Initializing Tracker... 
Tracker Error : TrackerUI.dll invalid, not loading"

That has to do with dll file that valve added that's useless right now. If you want to get rid of that error in your valve/cl_dlls/ dir there's a file called, "GameUI.dll", rename it "_GameUI.dll" or just delete it. It wont do anything to your game, aside from allow you to bind F1 and F2.

For foxbot, uninstall FoxBot. Then reinstall it with support for metamod. That way it will configure itself to load through metamod.

ok the foxbot works for me now, but i still don't know what command to spawn monsters? I know at first i got to type "meta load monster" then it produced information on foxbot and monster:

status  pend
RUN      -    ------> FoxBot
status  pend
open    load  ------> Monster plugin

if i want to spawn monster do i type directly like this: "monster agrunt [FoX]Earp" in the console? Or there is a specific steps?

HOLY!!!!!!!!!! At last i got it to work!!!! Thanks for your help botman & Lunatic!!!

There is a metamod configuration setting file, i just add:

win32 ../FoxBot/FoxBot.dll
win32 dlls/monster_mm.dll -------> added this

and it works!!!! But i wondering metamod.ini seems to do nothing...

well~ Thanks again!!!

Metamod.ini is the loader between the server mod and the server. It loads foxbot and monster and any other metamod plugins you wish to load.

I normally dont bother but for some reason  (obvious ones...) i felt compelled.

10 minutes of Botmans time?......
Took longer than that to write the read me that you obviously didnt read. Opened it? maybe, read it? Hardley. 10 minutes x 1 person = 10 minutes,
10 minutes x 100 people =1000 minutes etc etc...

You stated "you still dont know what commands to use to spawn monsters.." You can spawn monsters from the console using the "monster" command.  The
"monster" command should be followed by the name of the monster you wish to
spawn and the name of the player you wish to spawn the monster next to (or
you can use the player index # from the "status" command).  You can enter
"monster" (without the quotes) to get a list of the valid monster names that
can be spawned.  If the player's name contains a space, you will need to use
double quotes around the player's name.  Here's some examples of using the
"monster" command...

monster agrunt Player(1)
monster hassassin "The Dark Avenger"
monster snark #4
STRAIGHT FROM THE README.TXT YOU "READ"
The best way to actually learn is to "really" try.
 Your lucky Botman even answered you back after your first reply to him. And Lunatic (bless him) gave you the info almost verbatim from the same "readme" file.
All i can say is...Lunatic and Botman..your better men than me.

Who cares? Honestly I'd rahter tell this kid how to do something like this then have him ask and ask and ask. Although reading the readme would have made more sense then my post.

Then again, I've never read the readme... most metamod plugins are self explanitory, once you've isntalled one, you've installed them all (unless its a UA plugin, they had to go out and fuck a perfectly good system over).

Everything I know about monster I've learned from the forums. Same is true for many of stripper's features. I've either learned from ripping someone's map apart or just READING :).

I also don't sleep much (EG its 3:30 am right now). That and I type fast :).

Megumi Mishima, i have to disagree with the post by stump..  this is why the forums are here, to help out people who dont understand.. i post alot of questions here, and bot and lunatic are very good with answering.. (among other people who have posted replys) dont let that one post discourage you. its not his fourm, and if bot and lunatic have a problem with you they would tell you.  you will find that adding new metamod plugins to your server will all install the same way...  everytime you do somting to your server you learn more. so keep it up, the more unique servers we get the better for the game.

sorry stump, i thought that last post was wrong.

Thats ok Clockwork-no offense taken.
And i wasn't trying to "discourage" him in the least.
Guess it was a case of "tough love" trying to get him to try reading a bit more before asking for help as he obviously didnt. I also answered his question on the monster spawn command problem he was having so the post wouldnt be all flame and no help :) I suppose i was a bit appalled at his demeanor toward Botman. 
Yes these forums are for help and a good source they can be when used properly. My original post to Megumi was the first (and hopefully the last) negative laden reply ive ever left on any board. I post rarely but i read these forums and others related nightly and have learned much from all of them.
Peace....
