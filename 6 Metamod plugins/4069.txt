Subject: Changing properties of an entity

Is there any way to change the properties of an entity once it has been created with stripper2? 

Specifically, I am trying to create a sprite that is initially invisible (easily done by setting its renderamt to zero)but becomes visible later (renderamt change to 255) when a certain event occurs. The sprite needs to be constantly visible after appearing.

Stripper2 will only spawn an entity, not change it after it has already spawned.

There are some entities in some MODs that will change the behavior of other entities (see some Half-Life mapping tutorial websites about 'trigger' entities).

It really depends on what MOD you are working with.

Thanks, found a mapping tutorial that did the trick!

Do you want to show everybody what you did?  :)

Well all I can provide as of now is this unfinished example. The sprite has a black box around it for some reason (I have tried changing the rendermode to no avail), but you get the idea. I am still relatively new to the strange realm of sprite creation.

This will create an invisible sprite near the center of the airfield in crossfire. Forty-five seconds in, the sprite will be made visible. 

Of course anything can be used as a trigger- I just used trigger_auto in this example. You could also make the sprite go away with a killtarget if you wish.

try

  rendermode/3 // Glow Render Mode
  renderamt/90 // 90 FX Amount

No luck, cheesemonster. I tried it and this time the sprite started visible (with the black border) and then appeared at the set interval. It was just the same as the example I gave except:

{
classname/env_render
targetname/revealsprite
target/teleportExit
rendermode/3
renderamt/90
}


I had already tried setting rendermode to 3 in the sprite entity itself before with no luck. Evidently the rendermode is hard-coded into the sprite and you can't change it on the fly. I think you would have to create a new sprite.

Anyway, as I said that was just an example for posting here since botman asked me to. The black border doesn't affect me since I had created my own sprite with a grey border that works for my purposes. But hopefully I have given someone a starting point if they ever decide to try it.

I know there must be more than a handful of people that have mastered the realm of sprite creation- it just seems like there are none. If anyone knows how to create an animated sprite, please clue me in!

rendermode 5
makes the black backround invisible
:)

Mark, I had already tried that- it doesn't work either. You would think it would, but it doesn't. Evidently, that attribute is hard coded into the entity and can't be altered on the fly. You can try fooling around with it on your own, but as I said earlier, I don't actually have that problem with the particular sprite I'm using- it was just an example of what env_render can do, and as it turns out can't do.

why not just give it a name and target it with something? once you give it a name it will start off.

{
"origin" "5 469 -428"
"renderamt" "255"
"rendermode" "5"
"targetname" "axeman"
"model" "sprites/axeman.spr"
"framerate" "5"
"rendercolor" "0 0 0"
"classname" "env_sprite"
}
{
"model" "*72"
"wait" "10"
"target" "axeman"
"classname" "trigger_multiple"
}
of course if you want it to go off again you would need a multi manager in there too.

Already tried that too. No dice.

But again, due to the nature of the sprite I am actually using( not the one in the example) I am able to mimic invisibility/visibility just fine. If you want to play with the code on your own be my guest. :)
