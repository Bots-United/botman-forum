It is written in C++.

Do you mean you want to take a C++ class?  That's fine, but just taking a C++ class won't be the only thing you need to create metamod plugins.  You WILL need to understand C++, but you will also need to understand the Half-Life SDK (reading through many of the Half-Life coding tutorials found on there websites will help) and you will need to understand how the Half-Life engine handles entities (again, reading the Half-Life code tutorials helps but also take a look at some of the mapping and modeling tutorials to understand how the engine deals with those items as well).  After about 4 to 6 months you should begin to understand enough to be able to create simple metamod plugins yourself.  After about 9 to 12 months of working with the Half-Life engine, you'll begin to understand enough to create something similar to the Monster plugin.

Are you willing to dedicate that much time to it?

I already put alot of time into half-life.  I run a server and make the website for my server and a friends server.  I also made an every good .cfg for a mod called DragonModz.  I waste time in Photoshop making graphics.  I would like to stop all the little projects and start something big.  I think C++ and half-life plugins just might be it. 
-Thanks for the help I will get that sdk readme and will start c++ when I go to college.
