Hey, i have been using Stripper2 for a week or so now and i am a n00b at it.  I did a config file for jeepathon2k and it took me almost all week and i still don't have what i was wanting to end up with.  I was wondering if there is some website someone could give me that you can share config files and download each others.  I think this would make it easier and save time for lots of people.  If anyone knows a good site that has config files for stripper2 could you please send it to me.
THANX

That's not a bad idea for a site, I'll work on one.

You're always welcome to post Stripper2 config files here if you wish.

It would be a little difficult to see them all without reading the forum posts, but if you are looking for something specific, you could use the "Search" feature to search for specific things (like "jeepathon" for example).

You'll need to give a little more detail about what you mean by "a car".

If you just want to create a model in the game (that players don't interact with), you can create your own model (using Milkshape?) and add that model by spawning a "env_sprite" entity.  See the crossfire_str.cfg file included with Stripper2 for an example of creating a env_sprite entity.  Just replace the "model" key with "models/car.mdl" (or whatever you call your new model).  Be SURE to use PRECACHE_MODEL in the .cfg file before creating the entitiy (again see the crossfire_str.cfg for examples).

If you are trying to create a car that moves around on a specific path, you can create a "func_train" entity to do this.  You will also need a "func_traincontrols" entity to start and stop the train.  Check on some Half-Life mapping tutorial websites for information on what is needed to create a func_train.

If you are trying to create a car that players can drive around anywhere they want, the only MOD that I'm aware of that supports this is Counter-Strike.  If you're not using CS then it can't be done.  Search for Counter-Strike mapping tutorial websites to find tutorials on creating a vehicle in Counter-Strike maps.

Yea i am using CS, so there is no way to make a car that drives everywhere on the map with stripper2 :( 
I am not exactly a mapper or anything but i will try what u said.

Is there anyway to make a turret or sentry gun on CS?

You could make a car, just use textures already in the map and then change their render properties to be solid colors.

I have no clue how CS entites work, I've only done VS and TFC.

Vechicles in CS are constructed from brush models.

You CAN NOT create a brush model on the fly using Stripper2 (no how, no way).  You can only clone existing brush models to create new brush models (that look exactly like the original brush models).

If the map already has a vechicle you might be able to clone it and make it drivable.  If the map does not contain a vehicle, the only vehicle you can create would like REALLY funky since the brush models you would have to duplicate for it would be something like a railing, or ladder or some other brush model from the map.

I finally made it. Filesection for my site, and there is a section for stripper2 configs. You can send me your config if you want it to my page by email: zed1@jippii.fi and give your name, config description and your homepage if you have. And your config of course ;D
