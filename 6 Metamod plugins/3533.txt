Tried to spawn a creature near a player and got the "cannot find player x" msg several times. Was it because of his name? It was like [DK5]Darblas.

Tried putting double quotes around the name?

You HAVE to match the name exactly.  If the player's name is "[DK5]Darblas" you can't just put "Darblas" since they aren't the same.

It's easier to use "status" to find the player's index and use the index number (#N) instead of the player's name.
