"i download the zipped text achives what is it?"

It's a zipped copy of all the messages on the forum up until that point in time (in a nice easy to read text file format).  Just open the .txt messages with any text editor and read the threads.  You can use the "Find Files" or "Search" thing in Windows to search through those files for a topic you are interested in.

Read the ReadMe.txt file included with the Monster plugin.  It tells you explicitly how to install metamod and how to install the Monster plugin.

1. Yes, you have to be a server operator.  You cannot create monsters on a server that you have connected to over the Internet.

2. See the ReadMe.txt file included with Stripper2 (same installation procedure as the Monster plugin).  RTFM.

3. Stripper2 allows you to strip out (or remove) entities from a map file.  For example, you can strip out weapons that spawn on the ground in Half-Life deathmatch.  You can strip out player spawn points.  You can strip out ladders, doors, buttons, etc.  You can also add new entities using Stripper2.  You can create new player spawn points.  You can create new weapons that spawn into the map.  You can create teleporters to quickly jump from one spot in the map to another.  There are some examples include with the Stripper2 .zip file (see the .cfg files included with it).  Also read through lots of the messages in this forum.  There's plenty of examples that other people have created.

AND YES, YOU HAVE TO BE THE SERVER OPERATOR TO ADD OR REMOVE THINGS FROM MAPS USING Stripper2.

4. Read the ReadMe.txt files, then ask a specific question if you have a problem.

5. Perhaps you don't have cookies enabled on your web browser.  This forum requires cookies to be enabled (so if you're running any software that blocks Ads, Cookies or any other web page content, you may have to disable that while using this forum).

Also I think he just spelled it out pretty clearly for you
