I added a critter to a map. He is set to spawn 65 seconds in, but what happens is he spawns about 10 seconds in, and then every 65 sec thereafter. What am I doing wrong? It seems like he just can't wait to come in and eat some tasty humans.

For the Monster plugin, the "delay" field in the monster .cfg file is how long to wait after the monster is killed before it gets respawned.

There is no way to set a delay before the first time a monster is spawned.  They will spawn the first time immediately after the map is loaded.

Ok, no problem botman.
I will just add some explosions that will kill the monster the first time. :)
