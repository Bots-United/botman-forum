go to http://www.geocities.com/monsterplugin

Change in this version:

Gargantura can damage/Kill other monster without crashing the server

Barnacle will have 10 second killing delay after you have pulled into its body, no one can kill it until the barnacle kill its enemy

server will not crash when you spawn too much icky(i haven't crash my server as i spawned 15 icky in 2fort)

You can now kill the stupid Gman and will will bleed

Bugs i know so far:

Tentacle will not attack the monster(hgrunt) which is attack the tentacle, it just stand there and not attack, but it still attack player

All of the Monster .cfg file stuff is handled in the monster_config.cpp file.  Just modify it to include any additional parameters that you want to set, then set those values when the monster is spawned in the spawn_monster() function (found in the dllapi.cpp file).

i found that kill delay of barnacle have a big bug, when you killed be other player while inside the barnacle body, you will die every time when you respawn, so please don't spawn barnacle at that moment until i fix it

Been testing latest version---Works much better with less crashing---ickys i spawned 20 in the water with no problems.
Gargantua---only time i got it to crash is when they fight the hgrunts---if they are close and he footstomps then burns them with hand fire---when the footstomp fire reaches them when they are dying--it crashes---repeated this several times.
Good work-keep it up :)
