im converting dm maps for tfc, even though you can use them, im trying to get them to be 4 player dm..  so far eveything is good, except team oriented items are up for grabs.. i added this info_tfdetect and changed the info_player_deathmatch to info_player_teamplay

it still isnt working.. have i missed somthing.. here is my tfdetect
{
"origin" "0 0 0"
"team4_name" "KOROVA MILKBAR SS DEATHCORPS"
"team3_name" "HORRORSHOW DOGZ OF WAR"
"team2_name" "MOLOKO PLUS BAD ASS BOYZ "
"team1_name" "ULTRAVIOLENT SUCICADAL DROOGIES"
"maxammo_cells" "0"
"maxammo_shells" "0"
"maxammo_nails" "0"
"maxammo_rockets" "0"
"classname" "info_tfdetect"
}
