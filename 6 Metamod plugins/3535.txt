I guess you used BotMixer and forgot to uninstall it properly.

Uninstall BotMixer5000 using its remove.bat file for the mod.

That error is cause when you load a bad DLL.

Remove the Sturmbot, and modify the DoD\liblist.gam file so that the "gamedll" option loads the DoD game DLL from the "DoD\dlls" folder instead of the Sturmbot.

Download the Sturmbot from somewhere else (since you probably got a corrupted download) and try reinstalling it.

ok...i just got it, and i'm kicking myself for this one

i assumed too much on this configuration...for sturmbot and admin mod to work together on dod, you have to add:
"+localinfo mm_gamedll sturmbot/dlls/STURM_bot.dll"
to your dod shortcut, so i assumed that you'd have to do the same for stripper2...soon as i took the local info line for stripper away it worked

thanks guys...and botman, you rock for making stripper, simply genius!!

In the end, always read the ReadMe.txt file that comes with any application.  You'll notice in the ReadMe.txt file that comes with Stripper2 it tells you explicitly how to install and configure it so that Metamod will load it.
