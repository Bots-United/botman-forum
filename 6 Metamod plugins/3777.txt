"func_recharge" is the HEV suit armor wall charger.

"func_healthcharger" is the wall mounted health charger.

(Again, if you use some Half-Life mapping tutorial websites, it will GREATLY help you figure out what entities are used for what purposes.  A good one to start with is www.valve-erc.com)

I'm currently finishing some very minor tweaks on Bond Nightfire.

The next project I'm working on at Gearbox hasn't been publicly announced yet and I can't tell you anything about it.  The project should be announced sometime next year.

are healthchargers only for deathmatch maps?

Yes, func_healthcharger and func_recharge only exist in Half-Life deathmatch (unless you have seen them in the .fgd file for other MODs).

Doesn't a health charger require a solid to be placed on?

No, the brush model is just eye candy.  You can create a func_whatever anywhere you want and use it (for example, I embedded a func_button in the middle of the wall in my crossfire_str.cfg file).  You can use the button (even through walls) as long as it is in your view cone.

If you are just creating a "func_whatever", you won't "see" anything.  There is no model or texture or anything solid associated with a func_heathcharger.

You should be able to USE it even though you don't see it (if you know it's there).

You will also need to spawn some model so that you can see there is something there to use.  You could use "env_sprite" to spawn a model.  Try displaying a headcrab model on the wall and use that as a func_healthcharger (or you can use any other model that is available or one that you create yourself).

this is from gasworks.bsp

Key/Value         : classname/func_recharge
Key/Value         : model/*35


what does this model mean?  *35

That's the texture thats used.

What I'd suggest is using a dispensor.mdl that comes with TFC, and possibly a sprite file with a red cross (or possibly use the medic! sprite :)) floating above the dispensor.

Anytime you see "*" in a model means that it's a brush model.

Look up "brush models" on any Half-Life mapping tutorial website and you'll find out what they are and how to create them in Worldcraft.

is this what im looking for?

That is a Prefab.  Prefabs are pre-fabricated brushes that you can load into Worldcraft to create a brush model.

Then when you save the map file created by Worldcraft, you can compile the map source to create the .bsp file.  The .bsp file will contain that collection of brushes (the prefab) as a brush model.

You can't create brush models on the fly using Stripper2.  They can only be created using a map editor like Worldcraft.

What you can do is create a standard model file (.mdl) using something like Milkshape that has the same look as the prefab.  Perhaps there's a tutorial somewhere on converting prefabs into models.

Once you have a model that looks like what you want, you can use that when creating the "func_xxx" entity instead of using the brush model (*xxx) that you would normally find in a map.
