Subject: Can't run dedicated server

Hi folks, had a problem trying to get the HPB Bot to load while running the Stripper2 plugin but after changing the command line on my hl shortcut, the bot loaded and all seemed well and it all is well unless I try to run a dedicated server. As soon as I do the Bot doesn't load (Stripper2 and Cheating death doe's tho). 
Any ideas?

You need to use the "+localinfo" command line option to get metamod to load a bot DLL plus the metamod plugins.

Search this forum for "+localinfo" and you'll find many threads explaining how to use it.

Thanx for the response. I'd already added the '+LocalInfo......' line but the Bot only loads when I start a game (lan or internet) normally. As so as I try to start a game as a dedicated server the Bot doesn't load but everything else does. I'm fairly new to all of this so all in all I'm a bit clueless.

Ps Top Mods by the way

The thing that controls what DLL loads is in the liblist.gam file for the MOD.

For example, in the liblist.gam file in the 'tfc' directory you have this by default...

gamedll "dlls\tfc.dll"

...that means the Half-Life engine will load the tfc.dll file from the tfc\dlls directory.

When you install metamod, you modify the liblist.gam file for the MOD to load the metamod DLL instead of the game DLL.  metamod will load the game DLL and it will also load any plugins you have defined in the metamod plugin.ini file.

When you install the HPB bot, it overwrites the liblist.gam file with a different version that loads the HPB bot DLL file instead of the game DLL.  The HPB bot DLL will load the game DLL (in the same manner that metamod would load the game DLL).

The problem comes in that you can't load both the HPB bot DLL and the metamod DLL from that one entry in the liblist.gam file (and you can't have 2 'gamedll' entries in the liblist.gam file.

Metamod solves this problem by allowing you to specify one additional DLL that it can load (in this case it would be the HPB bot DLL).

You want to look at the liblist.gam file for the MOD that you are trying to run (or the one in the 'valve' directory if it's just deathmatch), and verify that the 'gamedll' entry is configured for the metamod DLL.  This should cause metamod to run when you start the game (regardless of whether you do it from the Half-Life game menu, command line, or dedicated server).

You should see the metamod startup banner on the console when the game is loading (with the metamod revision and date information).  Once you have verified that metamod is loading, you can add the "+localinfo" to your shortcut (or console command line) to get it to load the HPB bot DLL in addition to metamod plugins and the game DLL.

If you still can't get this working, prehaps you should post exactly what you have in the shortcut (or command line that you are typing in) and also post the full pathnames of where you have the HPB bot DLL installed, where you have the metamod DLL installed, and which MOD you are trying to run.

Thanks again:
Running a standard Half life DeathMatch
My Liblist looks like this :
// Valve Game Info file
//  These are key/value pairs.  Certain mods will use different settings.
//
game "Half-Life"
startmap "c0a0"
trainmap "t0a0"
mpentity "info_player_deathmatch"
gamedll "addons\metamod\dlls\metamod.dll"
gamedll_linux "dlls/hl_i386.so"
//gamedll "addons\metamod\dlls\HPB_bot.dll"


The path to the MM.Dll is :
C:\Sierra\Half-Life\valve\addons\metamod\dlls\Metamod.dll


My shortcut startup line is :
C:\Sierra\Half-Life\hl.exe -console +localinfo mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_Bot.dll

Like I said everything works ok until I try to run the server dedicated mode, that is if I start a game where I can play on the same machine that is the server, Metamod kicks in as doe's the stripper2 plugin and the Cheating Death plugin. After 2 or 3 seconds the Bot joins the game.

But when I try to run the server in dedicated mode everything starts except the bot

What I'm doing is starting from the same shortcut chossing Multiplayer-Lan Game-Create game-selecting map and pressing Ok. This works fine. As soon as i tick the box marked 'Dedicated Server', I don't get the bot.

Thanx in advance.

Craig

I'm not sure if metamod wants the bot DLL to be in the "addons" folder or not.  You may have to manually create an "addons\hpb_bot\dlls" directory and copy the HPB bot dll file there.

See the last post in this thread as an example...

To be honest I'm not sure that I undedrstand everything in that thread (not the sharpest tool in the box when it come to this sort of thing!). I'll give that a go and let you know what occurs.
Thanx for your time.

No joy I'm afraid, tried calling the bot from the server.cfg, adminmod.cfg files using both the Addbot command and the + localinfo line and the beastie still won't boot up.
Strange how this only happens in dedicated server mode

What are you using for the dedicated server command line?

Was using the stardard Hl shortcut (with the +localinfo line) and checking the Decicated server checkbox. Been messing about with the dll's etc. for a little while now so I may have mashed things up a little. 
Going to start from scratch again (now I know a little bit more, only a little though), so I've deleted HL and the registry settings.
What I want to do is this:Run a dedicated HL deathmatch server with a Bot and certain weapons stripped out. The order in which I think I've got to set things up is as follows:
Re-Install HL
Update the exe
Install the HPB_Bot
Install AdminMod
Install Stripper2
Change the gamedll so it boots up the stripper2 plugin.
Change the command line on my shortcut to include the + LocalInfo line, so the Bot kicks in

Is that the way about it? And obviously any tips you could give would be GREATLY appreciated.

Ta mate

"Was using the stardard Hl shortcut (with the +localinfo line) and checking the Decicated server checkbox."

Ahhhh, that explains a lot.  When you run hl.exe (from the shortcut) and then check the "Dedicated server" check box when starting the server, the hl.exe application actually launches "hlds.exe" for the dedicated server.

You should create a shortcut to "hlds.exe" just like the "hl.exe" one with the following parameters...

-game valve -map stalkyard +maxplayers 16 +localinfo "mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_Bot.dll"

...so the Target: line would be...

C:\Sierra\Half-Life\hlds.exe -game valve -map stalkyard +maxplayers 16 +localinfo "mm_gamedll dlls/HPB_Bot.dll"

Don't forget the double quotes after the +localinfo parameter (they will be needed).

Then just double click on the HLDS shortcut to launch the dedicated server.

Already took the leap and deleted hl to start again!!! At least i'll find out how good 'system restore' is on XP. Chances are I'll have to start from scratch which, hopefully, shouldn't take me too long. 
I'll let you know how I get on.
Again thanx for your time

I think that "-map" should have been "+map".  I always get those confused.

Alternately, you can specify a starting map in your server.cfg file...

map stalkyard

...but DON'T put the ".bsp" part of the map name in the server.cfg file entry if you use it.
