Any monsters that you want to spawn dynamically (by issuing the "monster" command on the console) will need to be precached in the monster_precached.cfg file (look in the MOD directory, i.e. Half-Life\cstrike\monster_precache.cfg or Half-Life\tfc\monster_precache.cfg).

For example, if you wanted to be able to spawn headcrabs and snarks next you players you would have this in your monster_precache.cfg file...
code:
//agrunt
//apache
//barney
//bigmomma
//bullsquid
//gargantua - not supported yet
//hassassin
headcrab
//hgrunt
//houndeye
//islave
//icthyosaur - not supported yet
//leech - not supported yet
//controller
//nihilanth - not supported yet
//scientist
snark
//zombie

...notice that "headcrab" and "snark" have been uncommented (the '//' comment characters were removed).  By default, they are ALL commented out.  If you uncomment all of them, they will ALL be precached which can cause problems with clients getting "out of sfx_t" error messages (and the client will crash).  So DON'T uncomment all of the monsters in the monster_precache.cfg file unless you know what you are doing.

You can't spawn a nihilanth in ANY map because you would have to kill it the normal way and and anyway it would lag too much,AND you probbaly wont have any space to put him (like on well or 2fort).........Entmaps would work tho..........
