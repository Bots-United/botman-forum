--------------------------------------------------
I use monstermod to precache all the models and sounds and stripper to make the monsters,well after i run the map for a while i get Error Loading Out:Sfx_T and i dont see the rest.I used Stripper to make player friendly monsters(Barneys),made info_nodes to make path where human grunts go.The error comes either when ya try to spawn or you die.Also i need eny cheat code what makes me invisible to the grunts so i can take the demo.I'd wanna make map with player friendly barneys and info_nodes but the stoopid server crashes after a while.maps like subtransit wich have many floors are bad to use with info_nodes adding by stripper 2,i wanted the grunts go from the loading station to the lobby with lone barney but instead they go A)to water B)go to upper parts but thats not the problem,actually its kinda better.How i can keep that loading out of:SFX_T error not coming?[EDIT]oopsie,saw the answer at same page...but how im supposed to precache all monsters i want???[EDIT]

You get rid of the "Out of sfx_t" error by NOT precaching all of the monsters at once.  This is clearly described in the Monster plugin ReadMe.txt file...
QUOTE:
WARNING: Precaching too many monsters can cause problems in some MODs!  Each monster has models and sounds that are required by the monster and these models and sounds take up memory on the server and memory on the client.  If clients are crashing and seeing the error message "S_Findname: Out of sfx_t", then you are precaching too many monsters on the server.  Remove some of these monsters from the monster_precache.cfg file and remove them from map specific monster .cfg file for the map where the problems occurred (i.e. if clients are crashing when running the map blastwar.bsp, the you may need to remove some of the monsters from the blastwar_monster.cfg file).



Also, the Monster plugin doesn't support any cheat codes, so there aren't any that you can enter.

i wanna have all the xenicen and all the scientist npcs,i need everything expect barnacle and snark and bloater and gargantua on this map case.im using the expansion monster mod.i got all monsters expect 6 being precached in the cfg.that makes 15 monsters being precached.Theres no ichthyosaur,snark,barnacle,gargantua,tentacle,bloater in precache list.i dont know if ill need leeches,maybe in couple water scenes.btw can ya use stripper to put a loader(in half life intro)to load a small crate in that train in subtransit and then the loader disapperear?

You can add models (*.mdl file), but you can't create brush based models (like crates are usually done).

There are a variety of entities that can be used when spawning a model (func_furniture is one).  You can probably search this forum for "adding model" or something similar to find other threads about this.

I think it removes itself if it is embedded any any part of the world.

Make sure you're not spawning it too close to world surfaces or other entities.

You HAVE to have the CVAR 'mp_allowmonsters' set to '1' in order to spawn monsters in Half-Life deathmatch or they will remove themselves during the next frame rendered.

Add "mp_allowmonsters 1" to your server.cfg file, restart the server and try adding a monster and it should stick around.

i already have it on my server.cfg and listenserver.cfg,only osprey does this disapperearing when it spawns bug.

The osprey Think() code checks to see if there are any monster_human_grunt entities after spawning.  If there aren't any monster_human_grunt entities, the osprey removes itself.

It looks like the human grunts don't have to be in or near the osprey, they just have to be in the map somewhere.  As long as you have 1 monster_human_grunt that stays alive, the osprey should be able to be spawned.
