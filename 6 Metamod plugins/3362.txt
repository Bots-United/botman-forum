i got a list of entities in the tfc.dll and i posted them shawnserver.d2g.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=81here for my own referance

in that list i don't see anything that could be a backpack.... which one is it?

and how do i contain things within that backpack? i tried to spawn ammunition with ents like 
item_cells 
item_rockets
item_shells 

but those don't work when they are not in a backpack. i also tried to spawn grenades in the same location but it made a bunch of bouncing grenades not standing still lol

Go look at a TFC mapping tutorial site to learn how to create entities in a map.

It will also help tremendously to download the .fgd file for the MOD you are trying to add entities to.  The .fgd file will contain all of the items that Worldcraft uses to create entities in a map.  (You could, for example, search the .fgd file for "backpack").

The backpack.mdl (model) when associated with an "info_tfgoal" with the addition of items such as ammo, grens, health, etc., will give you what you're looking for.  Below is an example backpack in ZHLT entity form from 2fort.bsp.  Simply remove quotation marks and add slashes for Stripper2.

{
"origin" "-1072 -1424 -224"
"angles" "0 180 0"
"no_grenades_2" "4"
"message" "#cz_restock"
"ammo_medikit" "20"
"noise" "weapons/scock1.wav"
"team_no" "1"
"no_grenades_1" "4"
"ammo_nails" "50"
"ammo_rockets" "20"
"ammo_cells" "50"
"ammo_shells" "50"
"wait" "30"
"mdl" "models/backpack.mdl"
"g_e" "1"
"g_a" "1"
"classname" "info_tfgoal"
}

All of your questions can be answered by reading through some TFC mapping tutorials.  You'll learn a lot more this way and it's easier than someone having to explain every little detail to you.

Try this site, particularly in the "Entity Reference" section: http://tf.valve-erc.com/

Happy fishing!

Trying to make gren packs. 
I can make ONE or the other appear, but never BOTH of them. Any ideas what I doing wrong here?

      origin/1583 -1862 -457

Check your coordinates especially the Z axis.  Seems sometimes that the Z axis of an entity turns out not to be where you'd think it would be from the coordinate readings.  So: 1) retake the coordinates; 2) if they are the same as the prior reading try adjusting the Z axis plus/minus 20, etc. until you see the thing, then further adjust.

If you're having trouble with coordinates, seriously just decompile the map and open it with worldcraft. Find the exact spot you want the entity using the entity tool and check the coordinates in the bottom right of WC (or VHE... bad name same program). Or add the entity, name it something unique (targetname or name), save (.map format), then open it with Notepad search for that unique name, grab the entity (it will look similar to stripper format), convert it to stripper and tada. 

This is easier then it sounds, it's easier then trial and error.

Adjusting the Z coord plus/minus 20 in a stripper2 cfg isn't difficult either.  Might even be easier THAN employing Worldcraft.

what i did was open up the file "2fort.bsp" then hunt for tfgoals.....i copied one from the main respawn of red base then changed it accordingly what i call 'penguin packs' which are 50 life, 50 armor, 50 shells, 50 cells, 20 rocks, 50 nails, 4 primary grenades, 4 secondary grenades and has the model of a penguin.

here is the entity:
{
PRECACHE_SPRITE(models/penguin.mdl)
origin/0 0 -300
angles/0 180 0
armorvalue/50
health/50
no_grenades_2/4
ammo_medikit/20
noise/weapons/scock1.wav
no_grenades_1/4
ammo_nails/50
ammo_rockets/20
ammo_cells/50
ammo_shells/50
wait/30
model/models/penguin.mdl
g_e/1
g_a/1
classname/info_tfgoal
}
