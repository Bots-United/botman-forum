Well... I've been over the readme a number of times... Usually I don't find things this difficult. Ah well.

I was modifying the included ..._str.cfg for cs_assault, to add weapon spawn points. I used bsp_view to find the coords, and set them well above the ground. When adding the following config.... (I was messing around with delay and angle thinking that MAY have something to do with it)

{
   classname/weapon_hegrenade
   delay/0
   angle/180
   origin/-545 2290 140
}

{
   classname/weapon_flashbang
   angle/180
   origin/-331 2372 209
}

{
   classname/weapon_ak47
   delay/0
   angle/0
   origin/288 1798 106
}

I get nothing. The rest of the additions and strips work for the map... so i know the config is loading.... I just cant figure out what happened to MY spawns :op

Any advice?

the classname should be "armoury_entity" and in the "item" value should be 0 - 18 (the numbers represent things like weapon_ak47, weapon_hegrenade etc..., see the fgd file that comes with CS

Search this forum for "armoury_entity" or "game_player_equip".
