Those aren't models, those are gah can't think tonight, brushes. lol.

You can do something allong those lines by using the func_tank entity.

im looking for to put guns you can walk up and hit the use key to use.. an example is the twin guns in crossfire.. but i want 50 mm machine guns...  i found the info for them in the total war map. but they dont move up and down with your mouse movement.. the just point straight up and move left and right with your mouse.. the shoot where you want them to, but the gun will not point in the direction your aiming at vertically... for all purposes they do work.. here is what i have, any help would be great.

"model/*X" (where X is a number) means the model is a brush model (not a .mdl file model).

Brush models can not be extracted from the map and used in other maps.

it looks as if the gun is backwards.. when you move down it goes up.. up is down..

Someone else had this problem on their server. They were using the SG lvl 1 model and it pointed the opposite direction as you explained. Not sure why this happens. If I get some time I'll fool around with it and see what I can come up with.
