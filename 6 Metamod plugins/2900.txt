i am atempting to make a teleport that only triggers for a certain amt of seconds, and then deactivates. heres what ive tryed:
{
   classname/trigger_teleport
   targetname/move_em
   wait/3
   target/teleport_1
   origin/X Y Z
}

this just creates a teleport at that origin, not one that can be activated by say a button. any ideas?

I think you will need a multmanager to manager the trigger (but I'm no mapper).  Search some mapping tutorial sites for how to manage triggers being turned on and off.

i have a button with a relay on it. one end of it triggers this teleport, the other end goes into a multisource. My problem is, the relay stays activated for some reason which means that the multisource no longer needs the button to be pressed to be active. I have tryed changing the wait key on the button, and it doesnt seem to change. does a relay only tirgger once or something? thx.
