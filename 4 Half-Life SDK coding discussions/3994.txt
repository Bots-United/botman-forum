I'd just like to ask if anyone knows of any function that is called within the engine when HL is quit/exit back to desktop or whatever. 

Because I have loads of linked lists in my bot which I'd like to free up when HL has been quit.

I remember having a small look around before but don't think I could find a particular function for it :D

ServerDeactivate() will be called when the server "gracefully" shuts down.  This includes when you use the 'quit' command on the console.

Sys_Error() will be called by the engine whenever it is about to "crash" back to the desktop.

Both of these are located in client.cpp in the SDK.

ServerDeactivate() is also called at mapchange (and is then immediately followed by another ServerActivate()). So it might not be the best place to blindly free all your stuff.

If you're using Windows, I would suggest DLLMain() and a check for the DLL_PROCESS_DETACH reason.
