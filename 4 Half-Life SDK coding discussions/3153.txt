Could someone give me a complete list of all the .cpp/.h files that have code for players and monsters in the skd2.0 please?

You should start with SDK 2.2 (not SDK 2.0).  The .cpp files are named based on what they are.  For example player.cpp is stuff for the player.  shotgun.cpp is code for the shotgun.  zombie.cpp is code for the zombie monster.  Etc., Etc., Etc.
