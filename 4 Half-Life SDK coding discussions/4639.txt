I am trying to install an earlier version of gcc in order to compile the SDK and have it run on older versions of Linux. I am running RH 8.0 and did the following steps:

unpacked tar using: tar -zvxf egcs-1.1.2.tar.gz
changed directory: cd egcs-1.1.2
configure: ./configure
make using: make

After running make I get the following errors:

indstream.cc: In method `struct streampos indirectbuf::seekoff(streamoff, enum _seek_dir, int = 3)':
indstream.cc:82: `struct streampos' used where a `int' was expected
indstream.cc:85: `struct streampos' used where a `int' was expected
indstream.cc:87: `struct streampos' used where a `int' was expected
indstream.cc:89: conversion from `int' to non-scalar type `streampos' requested
indstream.cc: In method `struct streampos indirectbuf::seekpos(struct streampos, int = 3)':
indstream.cc:99: `struct streampos' used where a `int' was expected
indstream.cc:102: `struct streampos' used where a `int' was expected
indstream.cc:104: `struct streampos' used where a `int' was expected
indstream.cc:106: conversion from `int' to non-scalar type `streampos' requested


Is there a patch that is needed before running make? Anything I am missing?

Thanks,
