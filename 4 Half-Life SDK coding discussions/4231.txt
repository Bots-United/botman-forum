Hi All

In CBasePlayer::SetSuitUpdate the statement:
if ( g_pGameRules->IsMultiplayer() )
{
// due to static channel design, etc. We don't play HEV sounds in multiplayer right now.
return;
}

What will happen if I change this?

Thanx

More than likely the sound will get overriden by other sounds since they all shared the same channel number.

Normally in single player, when you get suit, you don't have people shooting other people and explosions going off and snarks biting you.  Many of the sounds in multiplayer share the same channel as the suit power-up sounds so it would start playing that then get wiped out by other combat noises.

If you give the suit to somebody in an area where they wouldn't be exposed to other sounds (each person in a separate room that no one else could enter and shoot at them) then you probably wouldn't have any problems.

Thanx.  So if I want to play sounds I have to use EMIT_...  Macro rather than the suit update.

Or, if you only want the sound played for one client, you can use...
code:
CLIENT_COMMAND(pEdict, "play soundfilename.wav\n");

...don't forget the '\n' at the end of the command.

Sure, but then you can't use the cool stuff like volume and pitch adjustment that is in EMIT_SOUND_DYN2. That's how I was making my first bots talk, and since now I've been usign CLIENT_COMMAND, it's less flexible than before.
