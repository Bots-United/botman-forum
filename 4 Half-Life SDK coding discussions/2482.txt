Hi!
I am a C++/HL Coding newbie, but i want to start with it... So i looked at this cool site and found infos how to compile the sdk with MingW32.
So I downloaded everything and tried it ...
argh
nothing!
Just errors. Maybe the MingW32 SDK is not for the new HL SDK Version. Whats to change???
Neeeeeeeeeeed help!

You should download SDK 2.0 or SDK 2.1 and use MingW32 to build it.  There isn't anything in the SDK 2.2 source code that you would really need anyway.  If you get to the point where you are serious about creating a MOD you will have to get Microsoft Visual C++ and at that point you can download and use the SDK 2.2 code.

Download hlsdk2.2 source at http://www.metamod.org/files/sdk/

It has MingW32 fixes.
