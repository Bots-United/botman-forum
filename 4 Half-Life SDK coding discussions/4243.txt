I have a entitys classname(func_wall) stored in a string(char Class), I need to make that entity:

Ent=CREATE_NAMED_ENTITY(MAKE_STRING(*ent*));

Anyone have some suggestions on how I can create that entity, since it has to have like int or something


One other thing I thought I would throw in:
Im trying to get a entity's model out of a txt file. I have everything working using a fscanf, but the part STRING(&Model) does not work on linux(does on windows), it crashes it, does anyone have any ideas on how I could get this w/o using STRING()?
