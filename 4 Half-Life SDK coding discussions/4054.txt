me again with another really really dodgy problem that no one will understand, hehe.

it's about "runfuncs"

havent quite figured out what runfuncs does yet but it doesnt seem to work for me on the client.

e.g. hl_weapons

i used to fire a million bullets (i.e decals and sounds only) every time on the client before the server stomped on me with it's version of events, runfuncs is supposed to trap the first occasion of an event so i should only fire one!? turns out that i had to hack in my gHUD.m_flTime to use as a timer (delta) for my client side weapons code because it was so rubbish by itself!


the other thing i did was take the code that hurts the player when the fall in CBasePlayer::PostThink and transpose some of it cunningly into pm_shared::PM_CheckFalling().. what this technically enabled me to do was have the client get hurt by their own prediction and then the server stomp on the correct values... all in one place... in theory, but under lag i get hurt by the client side code infinitley, like it's not clearing flFallVelocity!?!? so i had to comment that out and stick with fall-pain-lag, which is rubbish. shouldnt runfuncs stop that from happening if i check it? it doesnt.

in other places runfuncs does seem to have SOME effect in making the prediction more, er, predictable, like my jump code, it checks runfuncs before deciding wether or not to launch you.

generally though, when i'm testing the client and dedicated server on one machine (= thread lag) i get a wierd prediction effect thats really jerky, i take two steps forward and one step back in a way. like the client prediction is running too fast.. wiieeerrrddd
