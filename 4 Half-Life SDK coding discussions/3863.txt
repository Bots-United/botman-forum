How would I get the old style of scoreboard back?
I found this in hud.h but Im not sure if it has anything to do with what I want or not...

class CHudScoreboard: public CHudBase
{
public:
      int Init( void );
      void InitHUDData( void );
      int VidInit( void );
      int Draw( float flTime );
      int DrawPlayers( int xoffset, float listslot, int nameoffset = 0, char *team = NULL ); // returns the ypos where it finishes drawing
      void UserCmd_ShowScores( void );
      void UserCmd_HideScores( void );
      int MsgFunc_ScoreInfo( const char *pszName, int iSize, void *pbuf );
      int MsgFunc_TeamInfo( const char *pszName, int iSize, void *pbuf );
      int MsgFunc_TeamScore( const char *pszName, int iSize, void *pbuf );
      void DeathMsg( int killer, int victim );

      int m_iNumTeams;

      int m_iLastKilledBy;
      int m_fLastKillTime;
      int m_iPlayerNum;
      int m_iShowscoresHeld;
      int m_Scoreboard;

      void GetAllPlayersInfo( void );
private:
      struct cvar_s *cl_showpacketloss;

};
???

My SDK 2.2 patches www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?planethalflife/botman/SDK_2_2_Patches.ziphere use the old SDK 1.0 "classic" scoreboard.

You should be able to find the places where I changed code to support this (cl_dll\hud.cpp was the main one I believe).

[EDIT]

Ok, it compiles now however I typed bind mouse3 "+scores" and when I go and press mouse3 the console says invalid command.
Even though these are there?

      // Hook messages & commands here
      HOOK_COMMAND( "+scores", ShowScores );
      HOOK_COMMAND( "-scores", HideScores );

[ADDED]

Ok, that error where it cant find the command is gone, I press mouse3 now and nothing happens, no error messages, no scoreboard.
I used the scoreboard.cpp from the old source code and used a compare program to add the missing parts to hud.cpp. The only thing I did different was add an random letter at the end of some things because it kept saying about a duplicate function, changed the names so it would compile but nothing???

Completely lost now, does it have anything to do with input.cpp? I found gViewPort->ShowScoreboard(); there and commented it out... In game the scoreboard is gone so I think that may be it but im not sure, ive only been working in the mp.dll this stuff is all new.

The SDK 2.2 patches added...

CHudScoreboard m_Scoreboard;

...to the hud class in cl_dll\hud.h and added...

m_Scoreboard.Init();

...and...

m_Scoreboard.VidInit();

...in the cl_dll\hud.cpp file (also commenting out the sections associated with the VGUI HUD scoreboard).

Why don't you just install SDK 2.2 in some temporary directory on your hard disk, run my SDK 2.2 patches, and take a look at hud.h and hud.cpp to see what got changed.
