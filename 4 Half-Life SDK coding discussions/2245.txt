I'm an engineering student who's interested in mobile robotics. Our lab head suggested this project, and I'm just wondering if it could be done decently. I'm proficient in C, but still learning C++. I'm also an avid gamer, but I really have no experience in editing/modeling/map-making.

The simulation is for educational purposes and our lab head suggested that we (there will be 2 of us working on the project) use Half-life so we could focus on the physics engine, since the graphics could be easily (that's his word) implemented if we use a game engine. I think it would be a really simple simulation (for now), since the MobotLab plans to develop this program in phases. If anyone knows about Mindrover, that's basically what we want to do, but minus the weapons and fictional stuff, and of course, our graphics would be simpler.

We're thinking about letting the user choose the sensors(infrared, bump, sonars, etc.) and chassis (wheeled, tracked), then wire the components to create the vehicle's behaviors. An example would be bump-recovery: if the bump sensor detects a front bump, move backwards for 0.5 sec, then move forward and turn right. I have no idea if we can implement the user interface graphically, but if it's not possible, then we'll have to require the user to create scripts in C++.

Anyway, I'd just like your opinions. Could we finish a working simulation by February 2002?

Well first of all, anything is possible while programming, It just takes really good and determined programmers.

I think what you mean is that you are trying to make a mod for half-life that will simulate a car in a way...

(Just like I might use worldcraft for interior designing ;) Cos it's easy to use)

I think botman has the rest of the answers ;)

Hi,

If you wanted to create a scripting language, you could check out the gnu website for flex and bison, which will allow you to easily create your own scripting language for you robot. I believe that there are windows versions of these programs available.

http://www.gnu.org/manual/bison/
http://www.gnu.org/manual/flex/

OR

Maybe you could use an interface similar to the lego mindstorms development, where the user graphically drops sections of code into functions. I havn't actually used the system, so I couldn't tell you how easy it is to use.

Some links on lego mindstorms can be found here:

This has me interested :)

How about a HL mod in which the player has to "program" his robot to perform certain tasks, such as negotiating a maze or capturing the flag in a TFC map?

The "sensors" and "motors" elements could possibly be connected like the machines in Creatures 3...

Players could compete by having their bots face off against each other for certain tasks -- like Robot Wars but without the remote control.

It would probably be possible to program the client DLL to set up a simple robot "programming" or whatever interface.

Sorry I haven't checked back.. but thanks to everyone who replied!

We're just only starting work for this project, and I'm worried we won't be able to finish it on time. I still don't know much about editing HL and I'm not sure if what we're trying to do is possible with HL. Maybe we should just create our own program and use a free Physics SDK and OpenGL for the graphics instead.

Yes, the original idea was a "programming" game that pits your robot against others. You won't be able to control the robot once the game starts, so its behavior will depend on your program. As I've said, it's going to be a lot like Mindrover. Their website: http://www.Mindrover.com. 

But as for now, we're still worrying about how we're gonna actually implement "robot creation" and the scripting language. (Thanks, Spyro.. I'm still checking your links)
