Ok. I need to make sure I've got the basic moding/comiling concept right. Is this correct?
Basic Moding/compiling: 
(this is what I'm thinking, If I'm wrong please correct me)

After I've set up my Mod directory and made my liblist.lst thingy. I open the hl.dsp or mp.dsp and I could paste all the code I want to use (say I'm  pasting the already existing HL code) then compile it into the HL.dll (or MP.dll) and it should be ready to go?

1. You create a MOD folder (let's call it Blastzone) in the Half-Life folder (i.e. C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\Blastzone).

2. You create a liblist.gam file for your MOD (the easiest way to do this is to copy the one from valve\liblist.gam, tfc\liblist.gam or cstrike\liblist.gam into your MOD folder, Blastzone\liblist.gam).

3. You open the hl.dsp or mp.dsp Visual Studio project file and click on Build->Build All.  This will create the hl.dll or mp.dll in the Debug folder.

4. You create a dlls folder inside your MOD folder (i.e. C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\Blastzone\dlls).  Don't forget the 's' in dlls.

5. You copy the hl.dll or mp.dll file from the SDK Debug folder into your MOD dlls folder.

6. You modify the liblist.gam file in your MOD folder to change the gamedll setting to use the hl.dll or mp.dll file you just copied.  If you copied the valve\liblist.gam file and are using hl.dll this will already be correct.

7. You can the "game" field in your MOD's liblist.gam file to be the name of your MOD (i.e. game "Blastzone").

8. You start Half-Life and select "Custom game" then choose your MOD name "Blastzone" and click "Activate", then return to the main menu.

9. You select "Multiplayer", then "LAN game", then "Create game" and select a map, then click "Ok" to start the game.

10. If the game crashes, you go back to step 1 and make sure you did everything correctly.

11. You modify the source code in the SDK dlls directory, click Build->Build hl.dll (or mp.dll) then copy the Debug\hl.dll (or mp.dll) file to your MOD's dlls folder again (C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\Blastzone\dlls) and go back to step 8.

12. You do this over and over until you have the bestest MOD in the whole world and then you release everything to the public.

P.S. At some point you will want to build the client.dll which is in the cl_dll folder of the SDK.  You load cl_dll.dsp and build client.dll then copy that to your MOD's cl_dlls folder, but don't start with a custom client.dll until you have played around with the server DLL first (hl.dll or mp.dll).
