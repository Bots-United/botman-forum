Hi, I want to make a new MetaMod DLL for HL. I have some neat ideas and want to start a new mod. Can someone tell me what I need to get started, the stub_plugin at metamod.org is missing.

You need metamod source and the hlsdk.

the included example mods and botmans stripper2 plugin's source is very helpful

Are the example mods included with the metamod source?

I have all the source because I was making modifications to adminmod, now I want to release my mods in a new DLL.

"Are the example mods included with the metamod source?"

Yes, the metamod zip file includes the metamod source, documentation as well as the source to the stub_plugin, trace_plugin, and the wdmisc_plugin.

You can download the metamod source from the metamod web page...

http://www.metamod.org/

Ok, I got that figured out, now when I compile it says undeclared identifier strcasecmp and a whack of other errors. I tried messing with the includes but still getting same errors. Do I need a specific version of the HL SDK?

Ok, boom it's done. Now, I have a cell I've made up, how do I implement it?

The cell was created as a mod for the AM DLL. So I take it this AMX crap needs to go, and how would I replace it?

Really all I am doing here is rendering the player differently...

    pPlayer->pev->rendercolor.x = iRed;

But I need to define pPlayer.
When I was doing it in the AM source it was easy..

CBaseEntity *pPlayer = UTIL_PlayerByIndex( PlayerIndex )

But that won't work now. There must be an alternative.

It's in util.cpp of the Half-Life SDK.
