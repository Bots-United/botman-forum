Hi!
I have just started to look at the HL SDK and have some questions. I´ve tried to do some small changes in the inputw32.cpp in folder cl_dll and then used MVC++ to build the client.dll. 
How do I run my new client.dll with HL?

I moved the new file client.dll from cl_dll\Debug to a folder in my Half-life catalouge: C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\temp\cl_dlls\client.dll 
Like the structure for folders tfc, valve..
Should I put more stuff in my temp-folder?
How do I run HL with my new things included?

Tried to look at botmans MOD-FAQ today, but couldn´t reach it, some problems with planethalflife?! Have looked around at a couple of tutorials but could not find any specific answer to my questions.

make a liblist.gam file for your mod and run hl with the parameter "-game temp"

Planethalflife.com, gamespy.com and fileplanet.com have been switching Internet hosts so you may notice those websites are unavailable at different times (hopefully all this will be straightened out in a few days).

If you build the SDK (changes or not), you will need to create a MOD directory to test your build (of the server DLL, client DLL, or both).  You can run the server DLL (hl.dll or mp.dll) without a client DLL (the one in the valve\cl_dlls folder will get used by default), but you can't run JUST a modified client DLL (you have to have a server DLL in your MOD dlls directory).

The example in the MOD FAQ creates a folder called "Blastzone" (that's the name of the MOD).  In the Half-Life\Blastzone directory, you would create a "dlls" directory to put the server DLL in.  If you also wanted to test the client DLL, you would create a "cl_dlls" folder inside the Half-Life\Blastzone folder and copy the client.dll file into the cl_dlls folder.

You will need to create a "liblist.gam" file inside the Half-Life\Blastzone folder.  Here's a VERY simple example of a liblist.gam file...
code:
game "The Blastzone MOD"
version "1.0"
size "100000"
gamedll "dlls\mp.dll"

...replace mp.dll with hl.dll if you are buiding the Full SDK instead of the Standard SDK.  If you are building the client DLL you need to add...
code:
cldll "1"

...to the above liblist.gam file.

Once you have the MOD directory created, the "dlls" and "cl_dlls" directories created, the mp.dll or hl.dll file copied into the dlls directory, the client.dll copied into the "cl_dlls" directory, and have created the liblist.gam file, you select your MOD by starting Half-Life and entering the "Custom game" menu.  Click on the MOD name (in this case it should say "The Blastzone MOD") and click "Activate", this will let Half-Life know which MOD you are using.  Then return to the main menu, click "Multiplayer", then "LAN game", then "Create game", and select a map.  Click on "OK" to start the game and you will be running your MOD code.
