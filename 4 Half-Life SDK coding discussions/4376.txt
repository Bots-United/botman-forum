I made a modification to the mod Ricochet to allow
the selection of models. There were two in the mod
folder but one was hard coded in the SDK. 

Unfortunately, now each player can select from any
model in the mod folder but also any model in HLDM. How can I limit the selection of models to the mod folder only?

Thanks

Just find the name of the models in HL and block them.
