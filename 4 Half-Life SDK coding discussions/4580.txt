I'm a real newbie on modding, so I ask: Is it possible to make a multiplayer-friendly horse?

That depends on what you want the horse to do.

Do you just want a horse that people can get on and ride around?  That's definitely possible (it would be similar to the func_tracktrain entity in Half-Life for example).

If you just wanted a horse that wanders around, you could do that too.

If you're trying to make a stampede of 100 horses all running/flocking along together running past players or trampling them to death, that might be a little more difficult, especially in a multiplayer environment (that's a lot of data to send to all the clients).

My idea is a rideable one for an standard number of players (14-18)... 14-18 horses that you can ride or leave behind and maybe in some maps 5-10 cows that follows the player, but I heard that HL Engine can't handle that much... I do think that is possible.

That could be possible, I don't think the horses need anything better than a simple AI to look convincing. Just take care of the model animations, and ensure you have a fair amount of them.

Sure, that could work.

You could USE the horse to get on it, then have a different player animation for riding on the horse (so they aren't standing up in the saddle).

You would probably want to ATTACH the player to the horse and let the player movement control the horse (instead of controlling the player's body).  See the weapon code in the SDK for how to attach one entity (like a weapon) to another entity (like a player).

You make a few animations for the horse model for different speeds (walking, trotting, galloping, etc.) and play those based on the speed that the player/horse is moving at.  Are you any good at creating models?  www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/Milkshape can be used to create new models and animations.

Not good at all in modelling... but I could get help on that matter... and I hav seen a horse model around... based on that, it won't be hard.


Yes... the idea is a cowboy mod :d, but with south american taste.
