Hey all, i am lately playing around with the SDK. I got the mod on teamplay all the time and automaticly joining a team (2 teams only). That all works fine, i also got some very basic menu showing (but not working yet when you select an option though). 

The problem is, i want the player to become in spectator mode when he is dead, until the time he had to wait makes him respawn. 

I know somewhere in player.cpp you can find PlayerDeathThink, here a lot of stuff happends but the deathcam does not work if i change the code to find an other player entity which is alive and make it face that entity. This is also not really spectator mode.

I wonder if its possible to use the spectator options which are built in lately (1st person, etc), how to use those until respawning?

I've tried a spectator mode with my bot and I've had trouble getting the spectator to face a certain direction, it's like the v_angles don't seem to have any effect. Although I could still look around using the mouse etc... I think its becuase I'm setting nextthink to -1, but it should come in useful when you dont want them to respawn, when you want them to respawn set the nextthink back to normal.


this is what I done to an entity to make them spectate...

code:

                        listenserver_edict->v.viewmodel            = 0;
                        listenserver_edict->v.health            = 1;
                        listenserver_edict->v.nextthink            = -1;
                        listenserver_edict->v.movetype            = MOVETYPE_NOCLIP;
                        listenserver_edict->v.flags                  = FL_SPECTATOR;
                        listenserver_edict->v.flags                  = FL_GODMODE;
                        listenserver_edict->v.flags                  = FL_NOTARGET;
                        listenserver_edict->v.flags                  &= ~FL_ONGROUND;
                        listenserver_edict->v.deadflag            = DEAD_DEAD;
                        listenserver_edict->v.solid                  = SOLID_NOT;
                        listenserver_edict->v.takedamage      = DAMAGE_NO;

        listenserver_edict->v.effects = EF_NODRAW;




I done this to the listenserver edict on my bot cos it was easier than storing 32 different players cam properties .. :)
