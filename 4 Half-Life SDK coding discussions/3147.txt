Subject: Binding keys dynamically?

I'd like to define a key for the botmenu in the bot-config file, i.e. I will have to bind it explicitly when the config files are loaded. Is it possible to bind a key to a specific command in game? Which code would you use for that? I thought "bind" might be a client- or servercommand, but I didn't find anything there...

Thanks,
Tobias

I haven't tried it, but I would think...
code:
CLIENT_COMMAND(pEdict, "bind X \"command you want to bind to here\"\n");

...would work.  Of course, replace 'X' with the key you want and replace "command you want to bind to here" with the command you want.  Also be prepared for people whining about you overwriting their keyboard bindings with your menu (since this will effect the client playing on all servers).  Would it be better to modify the gfx\shell\kb_act.lst and kb_def.lst files?

hmm just my humble opinion... modifying these files is what I did for my bots... I thought it was cleaner and also it allowed the players to define the keys they want for each bot command.

Thanks for the idea with modifying the files! I think I will try that!

putting my 2 cents in, again...
Tobias, if you want to make it versatile (i.e. language-dependent, MOD-dependent and so on...) you can save you some work if you look at my source code. I have included a small utility (patch.exe) which is called in the install batch script, that patches the kb_act.lst, commandmenu.txt and liblist.gam files according to the MOD it is used with and the language of Half-Life (for localized versions, such as French, Italian and so on.) Just give it a go ;D
