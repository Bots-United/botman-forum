I am trying to get the game to automatically switch to a third person view when they switch to their crowbar, and then disable firstperson till they switch to another weapon. Tried tinkering with Deploy() in crowbar.cpp from the cl_dll project but with no success, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance
