If it just increased your health or HEV armor, those are just regular pickups (like healthkit, etc.).  If it increased your speed or jumping ability for a short amount of time, those are more complicated.

Describe what the power did (since each one is coded differently).

The error describes what it says, it can't find the CVAR "maxhealth" defined anywhere. At the start of the file you tell it that there will be a "maxhealth" CVAR outside this source file ("extern"), and as far as compiling the file is concerned this is OK for it, but when it goes for putting all the compiled files together, i.e. to link them, it can't find anywhere that "maxhealth" CVAR you're talking about.

I bet you just forgot to define it.

cvar_t maxhealth {"maxhealth", "100", FCVAR_SERVER | FCVAR_OR_WHATEVER};

"Creating library .\Profilemp/mp.lib..."

You might want to switch from the "Profile" build to the "Debug" build (since many people, including me, have trouble getting the Profile build to work properly).
