i've been trying for the past three days to resolve a compiling error, but havent managed to do so. i have looked through almost every forum, and didnt find anything (unless i missed it). when i try to compile my dlls, i get the following error:

hl_weapons.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "public: virtual void __thiscall CM4::WeaponIdle(void)" (?WeaponIdle@CM4@@UAEXXZ)

im sure this has happened to many of you, but i dont know how to fix it

You don't have "CM4::WeaponIdle(void)" defined anywhere.

You might have a typo "Weaponidle" instead of "WeaponIdle", or you might have defined the function prototype in a .h file somewhere and forgot to add the .cpp file to your project.

Usually people just forget to add the .cpp file to the project.

Things like 'Precache' and 'pev' aren't going to exist on the client.  You're using the same file to build the client and the server and that's causing your problems.

See the cl_dlls\hl\hl_weapons.cpp file for stubs used for weapons (for example, search it for "CGlock").

You shouldn't include your mp4.cpp file in your client build, just include it in the server build.
