Does the borland patch for sdk 2.2 work with 2.3? What must i do to make it compatible?

Anyone know where wavelength are now?

I don't believe my SDK 2.2 patches will work properly with SDK 2.3.

You really don't need SDK 2.3 since the only things added in SDK 2.3 have to do with the VGUI interface (voice communication and observer modes).  If you are using my patches to compile the SDK, you can't use VGUI anyway so whether you use SDK 2.2 or SDK 2.3 is a moot point.

Just download SDK 2.2 and run my patches and everything will be okay.
