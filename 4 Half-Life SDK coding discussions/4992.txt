I user PE Explorer to disassemble mp.dll, and look what I found...
code:

 SSZ100ACDE8__CZero_Tutor_Turned_On:
              db      '#CZero_Tutor_Turned_On',0
              Align      4
 SSZ100ACE00__CZero_Tutor_Turned_Off:
              db      '#CZero_Tutor_Turned_Off',0
...
 SSZ100B6878_career_restart:
              db      'career_restart',0
              Align      4
 SSZ100B6888_career_endround:
              db      'career_endround',0
 SSZ100B6898_career_add_task:
              db      'career_add_task',0
 SSZ100B68A8_career_matchlimit:
              db      'career_matchlimit',0
              Align      4
 SSZ100B68BC_career_continue:
              db      'career_continue',0
...
 SSZ100B6EF8_Ending_career_match___one_team_h:
              db      'Ending career match...one team has won the specified number of rounds',0Ah,0
              Align      4
...
 SSZ100B8544_CZCareerHUD:
              db      'CZCareerHUD',0
 SSZ100B8550_CZCareer:
              db      'CZCareer',0
              Align      4


(I also found a CZCareer Message)

Careers? Tutor?( that would explain the new _tutor cvars)

Valve testing too much on us?

I think they mixed the sources...

actually you should know that htese functions exist if you are browsing through the bots forum. Those functions are probably for the coming CS CZ release so 'normal CS' still is able to work with CS CZ.

Btw, disassembling the CS MP.DLL is illegal!

LOL, the dissasembler police are after you!

I think the intent of the license is that you do not derive something of commercial value from the code, or use it to harm the company, otherwise no one will care if you disassemble it or not.
