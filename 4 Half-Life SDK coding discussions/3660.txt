Hey-
I disected the glock code and wrote an almost identical gun. I changed the ammo to 8MM instead of 9mm. When I took my gun in the game I expierenced 3 major problems-
1) The guns makes no noise when firing.
2) No muzzleflash or mark where the bullet hits
3) The Ammo looks messed up  -- "30| 00" rather 
than what it would look like for a regular gun.

Another small question- I saw something called 
m_usFireGlock1 and m_usFireGlock2 <- How can I find out more about them..?

Help! tY!

Help plz?
