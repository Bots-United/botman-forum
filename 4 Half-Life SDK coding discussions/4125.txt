This is a continuation from the "RACC template" thread in botman's forums.

About unpacking PAK files :

PAK files in Half-Life are a sort of ZIP files, unless that there is no compression in them. PAK files contain many other files and directory that would normally stand in the MOD folder. For example, in Half-Life, all the single player maps (the BSP files) are stored inside the pak0.pak file (along with many others), in the "maps" folder. If you extracted them to the MOD directory, these files would appear in your valve/maps folder.

When the engine is asked to open a game file using the pfnLoadFileForMe() function (or the LOAD_FILE_FOR_ME() macro which is the same), it searches for the file in this order :

1. It starts looking in the MOD directory for actual files (example: cstrike/maps/cs_assault.bsp)
2. If it hasn't found a file, it looks then in the PAK files in the MOD directory, starting from "pak0.pak" up to "pakN.pak" where N is a number. For example, radio sounds that would be in the "pak0.pak" files and that are there because they aren't in the cstrike/sounds/radio directory.
3. If it hasn't found it, it then looks in the "valve" directory for actual files. For example, a file named "sound/player/pl_fallpain1.wav" which is not supplied with the Counter-Strike download (I think so), so the game uses the standard Half-Life sound corresponding to it (with the same name, but in the "valve" directory).
4. If it still hasn't found it, it looks through the PAK files in the "valve" directory (the normal Half-Life PAK files) the same way it did it for the MOD's PAK files.

If after these 4 steps it still hasn't found the file it was requested to open, then a 'file not found' error occurs.

Since in my RACC template I often use mfopen() to simulate pfnLoadFileForMe(), the files I am looking for with mfopen() must be actual files, and thus, NOT bundled inside a PAK file. That's why you have to extract the contents of your PAK files into your MOD directory. You can then delete the PAK file, it won't prevent the game to run, since all the files will have been extracted and the engine will still be able to find them.

But because of the order by which the engine searches for the files, you have to make sure that the files you will extract from your PAK file won't overwrite files that have the same name. Indeed, when you install an upgrade to Half-Life or any mod, all the upgrade does is installing newer version of files in the real directory structure, and not updating the PAK file. It still works, because the engine looks for actual files before starting to mess with the PAK files, and it saves people from downloading a 200 megabyte PAK file each time an upgrade is released.

Thus, in order to extract your PAK file safely (with a program such as Wally, QPedII or PakExplorer), I advise you to backup all your files in the MOD directory, THEN extract the PAK file, THEN copy back the files you've backed up onto their original location, overwriting if needed the files that were in the PAK file (since they are updated versions of these files).

Is it okay this time ? :)

That worked but maybe we should add checking in pak files because I'm sure most people who use the bot have reinstalled cs since theyve gotten it lol.
