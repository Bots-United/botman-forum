When I compiled my MOD a short time ago, it gave me an error complaining about an undefined reference to CCrowbar::SwingAgain() in the export file created.  It did not complain like this earlier, and no, I did not make any changes to the crowbar between the last successful/failed compile (I am using MingW32).  I commented out the EXPORT in the declaration line of SwingAgain(), and it compiled correctly.  What is the purpose of __declspec(dllexport) (the #define for EXPORT), and was it OK to comment it out?

BTW, how can I create my own export file, and would this help me in this case?

Like you said, the declspec(dllexport) keyword is used to tell the compiler to export this function from the DLL.

If you are running in Microsoft Visual C++ debug mode, Valve has added some prototypes to the functions that can be exported to make sure they are valid at runtime (thus preventing a crash for those that aren't valid).  Since you aren't using Microsoft Visual C++, changing this to not export this function won't cause you any problems.

But if I get VC++, do I need to uncomment the EXPORT in order to prevent problems?

No, you don't need to uncomment it to get things to function.  You can uncomment it if you want to run it in Debug mode and have it catch places where you forgot to export a function that the engine is trying to call.
