Now I used to code small databases and data conversion programs in C for DOS..and I understand the concept behind OOP and classes.

But the SDK is so confusing....I was looking the SHOTGUN.CPP to try just get understanding how everything works and it shows alot of precache commands for the W_SHOTGUN.MDL and others for the sounds...now I compiled just a plain MP.DLL and CLIENT.DLL and the guns are there the sounds are working but I can not find these files it refers to anywhere on my system...strange??
Tell me I'm crazy.

So I tried to change the models name to replace the shotgun with my model ( model is in the models DIR...I did make the W_ P_ and V_ and change the name everywhere in the file).
gettting API errors when trying to load the game now.
Can someone explain how exactly this happens.
where is it getting the models from?

Thanks to anyone,

have you looked inside the pak files, too? hl stores a lot of its files inside this pak files and you'll find some extracting programms all over the web :) this v_ and p_ stuff is i think about the different modelsof weapons when so carries them and sees them in his hands on his screen and when so is seeing this player from elsewhere

Thank You very much my friend...that must be were it is getting the files from.

I fixed the API error....and I'm not telling how.....

( well ok....I had deleted the MP.DLL file and started over with a fresh copy of the source code...when I compiled the MP.DLL I didn't put the copy command to put the file in the DLLs DIR...HA HA..what a moron :-)

Thanks again @$3.1415rin.
