ok, I am trying to find out how to make a player walk on a wall or ceiling by making an entity, lets call the enity func_walkable
if you have a wall and make it a func_walkable, you will walk on it as if its the floor, and your "view" will also turn.
how

You'll need to modify the physics code in the pm_shared folder of the SDK.

For rotating the view, look at the v_CalcXXX functions in view.cpp of the cl_dll folder (especially V_CalcRefDef and V_CalcRoll).
