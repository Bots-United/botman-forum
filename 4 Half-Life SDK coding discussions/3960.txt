In file triggers.cpp :


void CBaseTrigger :: MultiTouch( CBaseEntity *pOther )
{
      entvars_t      *pevToucher;

      pevToucher = pOther->pev;

///new
edict_t *pentPlayer = FIND_CLIENT_IN_PVS(edict());
CBasePlayer *pPlayer = NULL;

pPlayer = GetClassPtr( (CBasePlayer *)VARS(pentPlayer));
      
if       (pPlayer->HasWeapons()==TRUE))   
{
      UTIL_ClientPrintAll( HUD_PRINTCENTER, "YES");
}
else
{
  UTIL_ClientPrintAll( HUD_PRINTCENTER, "NO");
}
///new



Why always display  "NO" ?

Why use FIND_CLIENT_IN_PVS? Are you trying to retieve the player that touched the trigger? In this case it would be pOther/pevToucher and you haven't used it in the function.

what does FindClientInPVS do anyway? Do you know where I can find reference (even little) on it ?

Find's clients in the entities Potential Visible Set.  The PVS would be any clients that are potentially visible (based on the VIS information from the map file).

You can search through the SDK source code for places where FIND_CLIENT_IN_PVS() is used (mostly for monster AI).

There's also an engine function for finding entities in the PVS (pfnEntitiesInPVS) which can be called via UTIL_EntitiesInPVS() if you want to find entities other than clients.

Rafph, like cheesemonster said, if you are trying to do something with the player who touched a trigger, just use the pevToucher in your GetClassPtr() function to get the CBasePlayer class of the player who touched this trigger.  Using "edict()" with FIND_CLIENT_IN_PVS() would use the edict of the trigger which probably doesn't even HAVE a potentially visible set.
