I originally converted my SDK 2.0 sourcecode so that it would work with Borland C++ using botmans directions, but I just got Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and I need to know how to change it back so I can compile it with MSVC++.

Also, since I'm using SDK 2.0, will people with the latest patches be able to play (I can't update my version of Half-Life for some reason. During the update for giving TFC new models and stuff it stopped halfway through it and now I can't upgrade my version of Half-Life, anyway I can fix this problem too? Lol)?

The code you converted for Borland or MingW32 should work just fine with the Microsoft Compiler.  If you're getting any errors compiling stuff with MSVC, just post the error and a few lines of source code surrounding where the error is occuring.

SDK 2.0, SDK 2.1 and SDK 2.2 are all compatible with the latest version of Half-Life 1.1.0.8.  SDK 2.1 added model animation blending (not needed if you aren't using it).  SDK 2.2 added HLTV and voice communication support (again, not needed if you aren't using it).  You can build your MOD using SDK 2.0 and it will work with anyone using the latest Half-Life release.

You can probably fix your Half-Life update problem by uninstalling Half-Life, deleting the Half-Life folder (to remove unwanted leftover files), then re-installing Half-Life from your CD and updating to the latest version.  It only take me about 15 or 20 minutes to do this and I seem to have to do it every 3 or 4 months.

Alright, thanks for answering my questions. I think I figured out the problem;

I need the Microsoft Visual C++ workspace file for server side, and I need a makefile that works with Microsoft Visual C++. Could you please send me these files? I can modify them as needed.

client.dll - 6 error(s), 1 warning(s)




I have no clue why I'm getting those errors. Please remember that I'm new to client.dll coding and have never used Microsoft Visual C++ before, so don't bite my head off :)

If anyone has the server-side MSVC++ makefile or the .dsw file for the serverside, could you please send it to me or paste the text from in it up here? I would really appreciate it.

I exported the makefile and dependencies file onto..

http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pat.murphy/cl_dll.mak

http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pat.murphy/cl_dll.dep


..if you can make sense of em!

Btw my Cl_dll folder is in..

You should download the SDK 2.0 or 2.1 release from fileplanet.com and use the .dsw file from it.  Don't use the SDK 2.2 .dsw file since many of the source file names have changed (when Valve moved all the weapons clientside).

Post lines 224, 225 and 226 from your util.h file (where the error is ocurring).  Please don't post the entire util.h file.

code:

{
      g_engfuncs.pfnAngleVectors( vecAngles, p_vForward, p_vRight, p_vUp );
}



There is 224, 225, and 226. I'm not sure if I added that part to it or not, heh. I need to start commenting where I add new code :P

Thanks, but I guess I didn't explain my self very well.
I need both of those files but for the Serverside workspace.

Thanks anyways though :)

It's from this...
code:
inline void UTIL_MakeVectorsPrivate( const Vector &vecAngles,
                                     float *p_vForward, float *p_vRight, float *p_vUp )
{
      g_engfuncs.pfnAngleVectors( vecAngles, p_vForward, p_vRight, p_vUp );
}

...it looks like you haven't included util_vector.h since it has a method to convert from Vector to float pointer...
code:
operator const float *() const { return &x; }
// Vectors will now automatically convert to float * when needed

...try including util_vector.h before dlls\util.h gets included and see if that fixes the problem.
