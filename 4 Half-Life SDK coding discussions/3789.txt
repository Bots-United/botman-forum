c:\> cd \Borland 
c:\Borland> BCC.BAT then i change it like he says to this c:\Borland> cd "\sierra\counter-strike\sdk\source code\dlls" so i end up with 

C:\Windows> c:

When you start the MS-DOS window, you will be in the C:\Windows directory by default.

You FIRST need to change to the Borland directory (whereever you install Borland).  On my machine it's "C:\Borland".  If you installed the Borland compiler in the C:\Borland directory then you will need to enter this command...

C:\Windows> cd c:\borland

This will put you in the C:\Borland directory.  You then need to run the BCC.BAT file that you created...

C:\Borland> bcc.bat

This should set up the MS-DOS environment for the Borland directory (if you assigned the correct path to the Borland "bin" directory in the BCC.BAT file).

Then you need to change to the directory where you installed the SDK.  I would recommand NOT installing the SDK inside the Half-Life or CSTRIKE directories.  Let's say you installed the SDK in "C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\SDK".  You would need to change to "C:\SIERRA\HAlf-Life\SDK\Source Code\dlls" to run the makefile, so you would enter this command...

C:\Borland> cd "c:\sierra\half-life\sdk\source code\dlls"

(you need the double quotes for Win95/Win98 since they won't handle the space in the directory name between "source" and "code" properly without the double quotes at the beginning and end of the full directory path.

You should now be in the "C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\SDK\Source Code\dlls" directory.  You can then run the "make" command to build the DLL file...

C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\SDK\Source Code\dlls> make

This will build the DLL and copy it to whereever your MOD directory is inside the Half-Life folder (assuming that you modified the makefile to match the name of your MOD directory).
