I creating a mod (not a big one) and I got this problem.

I wanna make the shield....to a kind of "energy-Shield". "Translated", it means, that I don't wanna loose my health until the Shield has been depleted.

Can someone help.

In the TakeDamage() function, just check to see if the player has any sheild remaining and if so, don't do any damage (just return from the function).

I would say: decrease the shield instead, uh?
...else a shielded player would be invincible

That may be the intent.  The sheild may last for X seconds making that player invulnerable during that time.  Many games have an "invincability" power up that keeps the player from being damaged.

In the CBasePlayer class of your MOD client dll(correct me if the name of the class is wrong), there is a TakeDamage() function that gets called whenever a player gets inflicted damage. This function obviously is in charge of decreasing the player's health value (in the player entity entvars_t structure). You could modify the line in the TakeDamage() function that actually decreases the player's health to take in account a possible shield the player could have.

If you want to use the 'armor' field as your shield, I think the CBasePlayer::TakeDamage() process armor variation first before attempting to decrease the player's health value. You could just add a 'return' at this point when the armor gets decreased if the armor value is not 0.

By the way what do you mean with a 'copy/paste tutorial'?

With a Copy/paste tutorial I mean somthing lik for example this:


1st open mp5.cpp and go down to primary fire.

Next find this code
m_flNextPrimaryAttack = UTIL_WeaponTimeBase() + 0.1; 

Ok now look at the #''s at the end these repersent the delay (in sectionds) untill the next fire lets change it to 

m_flNextPrimaryAttack = UTIL_WeaponTimeBase() + 0.05; 

Now it fires at twice the speed of a normal mp5!!!

Now look for this code

vecDir = m_pPlayer->FireBulletsPlayer( 1, vecSrc, vecAiming, VECTOR_CONE_6DEGREES, 8192, BULLET_PLAYER_MP5, 2, 0, m_pPlayer->pev, m_pPlayer->random_seed ); 

You will notice there is 2 sets of this code, one is for multi player and one is for single player so edit bolth of them.

I will explain what most of this meens, the first number in the "( )"''s is a number "1" this number repersents how many bullets is fired each time its fired. Next is the vec stuff dont bother with this. Next comes the vector cone, this is how large of a cone the bullets fire in. "8192" is how loud the sound of the gun shot is. bullet_player_mp5 is the type of bullet it fires. you can find this in multiplayer_gamerules.cpp if you want to change the damage of the bullet. The rest i dont know about.

Goto the number 1 in the "( )"''s 
Lets change this to "2" so now it fires 2 bullets and still only uses 1 ammo!
So now we have 4 times the fireing speed of the normal MP5

But thats alittle unfair so lets make it fire over a really large area. Our choices are

VECTOR_CONE_1DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_2DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_3DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_4DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_5DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_6DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_7DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_8DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_9DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_10DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_15DEGREES
VECTOR_CONE_20DEGREES

The bigger the # the bigger the cone so lets change our defult VECTOR_CONE_6DEGREES
To VECTOR_CONE_15DEGREES 




OF course u don't have to make THAT big...:)

If you don't understand any of the Half-Life SDK source code, you will probably want to read through a few more tutorials until you begin to understand how things work in the SDK.

Very few people are going to create a detailed tutorial for you just because you ask them to.  You will learn more by figuring things out for yourself.  Look through the SDK source code to see how the armor works (search for "armor").  Look through the SDK source code to see things that use timers (if your energy sheild uses these), like the wall mounted health chargers or HEV chargers for example.  If you ask "How do I do X?", you'll usually just get a text response saying "Copy the so-and-so from the SDK and change it like this...", then they might provide a line or two of code but in most cases will only give you a text description of what to change.

You may find more "willing participants" on the Wavelength coding forum at planethalflife.com/wavelength.

If you want the armor to work normally, but want it to absorb all damage until depleted, you could just change this line in player.cpp:

#define ARMOR_RATIO 0.2

change to:

#define ARMOR_RATIO 0.0
