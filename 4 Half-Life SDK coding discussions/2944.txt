I'm not sure how to do this because I'm a n00bie programmer. 

I've seen POD do something like this... Every time the server swiches to a new level about 3 minutes after the level began a message in the middle of the screen saying this server is using POD and so on...

I want to do something like this... I've seen at Pink's tut...

how to print messages to clients. I want to do a

UTIL_ClientPrintAll( HUD_PRINTCENTER,"Welcome to my server!\n" );

Something like that. Can some one please help me?

Thanks for your time.

You can set a timer by creating a global float variable then setting it to the time when you want to send the message.  Check if the time has been reached in StartFrame() by comparing it to gpGlobals->time and then send the message to all players (look at the UTIL_HostSay() function in the util.cpp of the HPB bot source as an example of sending text to all players).
