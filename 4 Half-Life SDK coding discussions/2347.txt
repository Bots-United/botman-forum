i have made ALL nevessary changes in botmans changes.txt, all files are properly stored yet i get the following error

error.airtank.cpp:41: `dllexport' was not declared in this scope
airtank.cpp:41: syntax error before `void'
C:\MINGW32\BIN\MAKE.EXE: *** [airtank.o] Error 1

whats really funny is that theres not even the word "void" on line 41 in the airtank.cpp. I'm thinking with the new SDK, there could be some more nesesary changes that need to be made with miingw32, but not totally sure.  any help would be nice....

This is from the changes.txt file from mingsdk.zip...
code:
   In cbase.h:

      CHANGE (at line 55):

         #define EXPORT _declspec( dllexport )

      TO:

         #define EXPORT __declspec( dllexport )

You probably didn't add the extra underscore to _declspec.
