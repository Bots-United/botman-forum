My hlds.exe crashes about 1 out of 10 times while 'Downloading Security Module from Speakeasy.net'.  I had not really used the hlds much before starting to code my plugin.  Is this a common occurance or is it likely that my plugin is causing it?  I never have any problem with a non dedicated server.  

It seems to be very random, and it happens before the log file starts so its been tough to debug.

The unmodified dedicated server should almost NEVER crash.  If your server is crashing, it's probably something that you are doing to cause this.

Delete this line in liblist.gam:
secure "1"

I was just tinkering with some stuff last night and noticed that code I added to botmans HPB_bot in:

code:

void GameDLLInit( void )
{
  


is exec'ed after it says downloading from speakeasy but BEFORE it says download complete. Whatever the exact wording is I don't have on hand but you should get the point. So I suspect its something your doing in your addon code. I doubt that disabling VAC (secure "0" in liblist.gam) is going to correct your problem unless your creating a game mod of course... Even then I would suspect it just wouldn't find the secure module for that mod and would fail to be in secure mode...
