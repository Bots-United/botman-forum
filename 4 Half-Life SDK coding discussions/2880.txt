First I just want to thank botman for making it possible to build both server dll and client dll with Borland C++ :D I hate using MSVC++, it's a real pain in the ass, so now that I can compile both dlls with Borland, I'm using that instead :)

Now, my problem;

I've been using SDK 2.0 to build my mod. I haven't really changed anything client-side so that won't be a problem, but for server side, is there much I'll have to change from my old source to porting to sdk 2.2, will I have to redo the whole thing? Are there any major new changes in 2.2?

Unfortunetly server side and client side go hand-in-hand.  You won't be able to use the client from SDK 2.2 with the server from SDK 2.0 (the client side weapon prediction stuff will be all messed up).

It might be easier keep your MOD at SDK 2.0 using the changes that I made to the client side code and using my NoVGUI.dll file.  All of the patches for the client directory will begin with cl_dll_.  You can use those .diff files to see what was changed (the line number will be first, followed by 'a' for add or 'c' for change, then lines with '<' are the old code, lines with '>' are the new code.

You can go through these files one-by-one and manually change the client source code in SDK 2.0 to support similar modifications.

Then use the stuff at the end of the cl_dll_cdll_int.cpp.diff file to load the NoVGUI.dll file and initialize the display (by calling the InitDisplay function inside it).

Unless you have made hundreds of changes to the SDK 2.0 source code, it might be easier just to scrap all of them, start with a fresh SDK 2.2, make the patches, test the unmodified SDK 2.2 out, then cut-and-paste your SDK 2.0 MOD changes into the new SDK 2.2 source code files.

I'm not doing that, I guess I said something wrong in my post, I'm changing everything to SDK 2.2 now.

I actually already made all the changes succesfuly, I figured it out, thanks for the help anyways though :)
