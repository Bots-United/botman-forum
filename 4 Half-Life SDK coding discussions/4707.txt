this may sound dumb, but I am kinda of a newb to coding,(aka, I cant make up my own code, I use tutorials and help from forums)

any way, what is a particle engine? and what does it do/control?

sorry if the question sounds stupid, I just wanted to know what it is.

A particle engine controls the movement of particles.

The classic example is making a realistic flame thrower.  If you make each tiny speck of flame become a particle, you can make a large moving flame by giving those particles velocity (for movement), color (for visual effects), and collision detection (so they bump into each other and/or items in the world).

Another example of a particle system might be making realistic rain in a level.  In this case the particles would be somewhat bigger, but would still have velocity, color and collision.

You just have to make an engine that loops through each of these particles during every video frame and updates their position, and color and remove them after some period of time (the particle lifetime).

If you search on www.google.com for "particle system demo" or something similar, you can probably find lots of examples of simple particle engines.
