whenever im playing a game, i get an error with explosions, such as with the xbow and the rpg, especially when i kill myself. its something like "cannot find write_predist" (sorry... my console has been replaced by the SP HL loading screen)

does anybody know how to fix this error? it will really affect my mod if i dont fix it.

You are trying to send a network message to something that is not a client.  See this thread...
