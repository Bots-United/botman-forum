You must code the bot <b>yourself</b>, there are many people who have asked similar questions before, I suggest using search.

Think about it! To buy a weapon a bot must use the command "buy" followed by "menuselect X" where X is the category number of the menu with the gun to buy, then another "menuselect Y" where Y is the number of the gun.

i.e. "buy", then "menuselect 1", then "menuselect 6" will buy a desert eagle. Hint, to make bots use these commands, see botmans TEXT file that comes with the source about <b>FakeClientCommand</b>

So you have to figure out a way to do this (believe me it is <b>easy!</b>) It just takes a while to type it all in and find the correct menu selections for weapons.

I doubt anyone will give their code away if they have worked on it for ages but found it really easy, so I think you'll be able to do it yourself. Botman would say the same! He should give you hints on how to do the coding on your own as it is much better to learn it than to copy / paste and call it your own! You'll find similar things easier to understand and easier to do if you manage to do it yourself!;D
