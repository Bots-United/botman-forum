Hi everyone!
I have entity, based from CFuncTrackTrain (CBaseEntity) and I want it to have "StartOn" option.

for example if I know state (ON or Off), how can I turn entity On or OFF suring spawning...

if (State=true)
 //toggle on
else
 //toggle off

What do you mean by "turn entity On or OFF"?  Do you want to not display the entity?  pev->flags |= EF_NODRAW;  Do you not want the entity to collide with other objects?  Use SetSize() to change it to a point entity size (1x1x1 unit).

You're going to have to be a little more specific about what you want.

He might also mean he wants the train or whatever to be USED (on) or NOT USED (off)

yes, this is exactly what I want.
I have a train entity and it is spawns "inactive" - not moving.

I want to make spawnflag something like "Start On", but don't know how to toggle entity "On" on spawning...

Thanks a lot for reply :)

Many of the effects in the effects.cpp file have a STARTON/STARTOFF flag in the pev->spawnflags variable.

Usually the entity sets up a Use() function that gets called when something wants to turn it on or off.  Note that you can call the Use() function from the code and it doesn't require the player to actually USE the entity.

The entities in effects.cpp tend to use ShouldToggle() to check if they should be toggled on or off and use m_state to keep track of whether they are currently on or off.  See those entities for some examples.
