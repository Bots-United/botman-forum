Is it possible to code a mod so it can use .mp3's instead of .wavs for weapon and ambience sounds? For <b>Half-Life: Earthbound (http://hleb.empty-rift.com)</b> we have songs (Ripped from the SNES game, Earthbound) that we'd like to have playing in certain areas of maps and in battles n such but all together the songs are huge! Please help!

Implement a MP3 player in the client DLL... or just record the sound files to mono, 8 bit, 22 kHz. Players don't usually pay attention to the quality of the music when there's challenging action ongoing.

The "They Hunger III" single player MOD has a final music when you finish the game, it's just a low-quality wav file but it renders well enough for anyone not to notice it eventually.

Most people use FMOD to implement MP3 players into their client code...

I know I know im not talking about an in-game mp3 player. I want to use .mp3s instead of .wavs in the sound folder.

Then the answer is: natively, no.

Well, not exactly.  You can play any audio format for sounds within the game on the client, you just have to take the responsibilty of handling all the low level sound functions (opening the file, playing the file, closing the file, etc.) and, of course, you can't use the Half-Life engine sound functions to do this.

That's where FMOD comes in, you link it in with your DLL and when it comes time to play an MP3 file instead of a .wav sound, you queue up the file in FMOD and it takes care of opening the file, playing the file, and closing the file (with a little guidance from you to do these things).

I wasn't talking about implementing an MP3 player that is controlled by the person playing the game.  I just meant that if you want to play MP3 sounds in the game, you should use FMOD rather than rolling your own MP3 decoded.

I'm asking the question for him, because I'm just curious:
Can FMOD handle run-time volume and pitch modifications on the queued sound files ?

I suppose his goal is to make some sort of EMIT_SOUND_DYN2() that would play MP3s.

I would imagine that you can control the volume, but adjusting the pitch of an MP3 sound file probably won't make sense (at least not as far as FMOD is concerned).

To adjust the pitch, you'd probably have to use some "outside" code that can do real-time pitch adjustment.  Use google.com to search for "SOX audio utilities" to get some source code that can do pitch adjustment.  Just merge that into your audio output stream and there you go.
