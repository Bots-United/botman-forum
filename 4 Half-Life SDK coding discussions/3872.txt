In a Metamod dll for counter strike,
is there an easy way to force the model selection of human players? For example I would like to force all human players connecting to the server to use model #2 for both Ts and CTs.

Would this be done in 
ClientPutInServer () ?
{
   // if human connecting
   // force skin to #2 
}

You can force a client to change models by issuing the ClientCommand()...

ClientCommand(pEdict, "model whatever_model_you_want\n");

...This will cause the model to change on the client and the server will get notified of this change in the ClientUserInfoChanged() function.

If the client attempts to manually change the model back, the server will again get notified in ClientUserInfoChanged() and you can examine the "model" field of the infobuffer string.  If this model is not what you want it to be, use ClientCommand() again to change the model.

Great thanks but for 
"whatever_model_you_want" would I use the file name of the model or just the base name?

If for example if I wanted the CT #2 GSG-9 skin would I use: "gsg9.mdl" or "gsg9"??

I think it's "gsg9" since in the infobuffer the model is stored without its full path (i.e. "SET_CLIENT_KEY_VALUE (clientIndex, infobuffer, "model", "gordon");")
