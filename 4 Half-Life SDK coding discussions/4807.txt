Would you please tell me where I can find HL SDK v1.0 Source code?
Thanks.

Try some of these links...

You'll have to run Half-Life version 1.0.1.5 or lower for SDK 1.0 (I'm pretty sure SDK 2.0 came out with the HL 1.0.1.6 client update and the engine changed).  I hope you've got an older CD with the game on it.

Thanks, botman, I've got it!
However, I guess that SDK v2.x is for Half-Life 1.1.x.x and SDK 1.x is for 1.0.x.x. So we should use SDK 1.0 in HL 1.0.1.6
