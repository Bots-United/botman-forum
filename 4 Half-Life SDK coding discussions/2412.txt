I need a _good_ method of stopping clients running the tf_weapon_<whatever> command, if you catch it in ClientCommand it catches it when a player presses 1,2 etc. But if they type it into the console directly to my horror I discovered it bypassed it completly. Even changing the v.weapons had no effect on the direct console command. Anyone got an idea on how to block this? I thought of seeing what v.viewmodel the player had but this is unreliable (weapons like auto/sniperrifle have the same model).

I know some people have done weapon banning, I'm just interested in what methods you used.
