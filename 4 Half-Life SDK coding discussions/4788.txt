hi all 
is there any unique id for each bot to differenciate it from another bot of the same class.

thanks in advance

They will each have a unique name, but they won't have a unique WONid (if that's what you mean by 'id').

You can though differenciate players (and thus bots) by their user ID (player entity index). If what you want is to keep track of the bot on which your program takes an action, either store a pointer to it, or just remember its entity index.
