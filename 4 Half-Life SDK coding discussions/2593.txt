There's lot o posts like this although I know the search aint that great :(

Basically you need to tell the bots to use the " buy" command to open the buy menu (only when they are in buyzones or havn't bought anything yet or out of money)

The bots will also need to open the weapon selection menu (i.e pistols/sub machine guns) Also they will need to select what gun they want after that.

You can let the bots use the commands by using FakeClientCommand

Of course, you would want the bots to choose what weapon they want to buy. I would set up a table that holds the cost for each weapon and also hold all of the menu selections needed to buy them.

You can then use that table to go through each weapon until it finds that most costworthy weapon the bot can afford (i.e the best weapon)

You'll also need to hold something that tells if the bot CAN buy that weapon i.e. are they in the right team to buy it? Since aTerrorist can only buy AK's and CTs can only buy m4a1's.

Once it finds it you could then use the FakeClientCommand to buy that weapon, Yu'll need about three FakeClientCommands. One for "buy" , the other for the weapon selection ("menuselect x") where x is the number to select that weapon menu (remember the numbers here should be characters/strings) and the the gun they want to buy.

You may want to check VGUI network messages to find if a buy menu has appered, and THEN use the fakeclientcommands. This is not needed but makes the bots buy more realisticly.
