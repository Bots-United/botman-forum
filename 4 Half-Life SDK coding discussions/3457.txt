Well, I made an entity out of the tripmine sourcecode. I made it so it isn't really a weapon, and you can't hold as a weapon.
So I tried to make a command that would call CTripmine :: PrimaryAttack
But for some reason it won't work, the game doesn't give an error that says the command doesn't exist, but it won't place the tripmine either :

So any idea on how to do this?

Where are you calling the command and what is the code for the command.
