Hello,

Just a quick question:

I have made (tried) a new weapon, and all works well except, it does not display a bullet decal. You can shoot other entities and they would react as normal. IE: Player2 would die, etc..

If i face a wall and shoot, the wall doesn't have any holes in it :S

What could i use (UTIL_TraceLine maybe? I'm not sure about this so i'll leave that up to you to decide) to determine where the decal should be. I've tried other code from the Glock but i'm not sure what code there creates the decal.


Any help on making the decal would be great

Thanks in advance

Simon

If you could, maybe paste a full Pistols code (not the hl_wpn_glock) and then point out the decal creation code for me to see.

Thanks again

Take a look at cl_dll\ev_hldm.cpp at the EV_HLDM_GunshotDecalTrace() function and the EV_HLDM_DecalGunshot() function.

I will look thanks botman. Since my MOD is only Multiplayer (I only wanted the standard SDK) I hoped it would all be in mp.dll

I've seen alot of "Blaster" and "Super Shotgun" Tutorials, and they all have there own projectiles, and their decals are made in the mp.dll blaster.cpp and sshotgun.cpp files..

Thing is I don't know what part of "their" code creates the decals. An Explanation of that was sorta what i was after, but i will have a look anyway, 

thanks botman :)

And maybe an explanation of this is also required [sm]:S[/sm]

I am still getting the hang of "Half-Life Programming". I know C++ fairly well, but do you think you could give me an example of the GunShotDecalTrace() Funtion

Thanks

On the client, gEngfuncs.pEfxAPI->R_DecalShoot() is the function that creates a decal.  It takes the decal texture index, an entity index (from the decal traceline), a model index (if needed), a 3D world coordinate, and optional flags.  See the common\r_efx.h header file for the function prototypes for the pEfxAPI functions.

I can't really give you much more help than this.  You'll have to look at the examples in the SDK that use these functions to know what parameters to pass to the engine (and how to obtain those parameters).

You can also use the UTIL_DecalTrace() function found in the dlls\util.cpp file, if you want to generate the decal from the server (this will be slower than doing it on the client).  UTIL_DecalTrace() takes the result of a UTIL_Traceline() call and the index number of the decal that you want to create (this decal must be in the decals.wad file).

Again, there are examples of UTIL_DecalTrace() being used in the SDK source code, just search for them to see how it should be called.
