Ok, this might be a dumb question, but I surfed a lot of MOD tutorial sites but didn't find any info on this one yet.

How do I change the loading background  image. (The one you get when you e.g. connect to a multiplayer game). I doubt it's in the code, so my message might be a bit out of place :/ Sorry about that.

Thanks alot!

It's in a WAD file, can't remember the name. There is info on it in the full SDK.
