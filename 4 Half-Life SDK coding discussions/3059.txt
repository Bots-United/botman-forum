Hi all,

I am new to the forum and new to the SDK so forgive me if this is the millionth time someone asks what I am going to ask:

Can someone explain (in a very general way) how can monsters be added to a mod?
I have downloaded the Full SDK, I know how to program in C++.

What I am trying to do is to have population wandering around besides the normal hostages. Kind of R6 Urban Operations.

Thank you very much for your help.

If your talking about adding monsters into the map (which is what I think you're saying) then you have to edit the map. Try botman's stripper2 for this or if strippy2 doesn't support the mod you're doing try ripent. Also note that mp_allowmonsters 1   must be on.

I think he's trying to create a Single Player MOD that contains new monsters.

The best example I can think of is on the hlsdk2 website...

There's very few Half-Life websites with details on modifying the Half-Life monsters.  You're pretty much on your own on this one.

Thank you, but I may have to explain you what I want to do:

I want to allow 'monsters' in counter-strike. I am interested in Multi-Player not Single. Those 'monsters' will mimick normal population, wandering around and maybe take cover if they see terrorists. All this besides normal hostages.

Do you think this is feasible? Or CS doesn't allow for such a thing?

If it is not possible to use CS (as a base for the mod) what would it be better to look at? TFC? HL?

Thank you again.

It is VERY difficult to add entities to other MODs that don't already support those entities.  It's not impossible.  The monster plugin for metamod that I'm currently working on does this for TFC and Counter-Strike and will eventually allow you to spawn monsters from the Half-Life single player game in those MODs.

That sounds cool botman...

Does it actually work at the moment? :p

I've got snarks that can be spawned in TFC and CS.  They run around and attack you and reduce your health (and kill you) and you can shoot at them with the standard weapons in those MODs.

I've got bullsquids and headcrabs and zombies spawning, but they don't run around (since the single player AI uses the graph nodes).  If you shoot at them they will turn to face your direction and make the pain sounds, but that's about all they do right now.

I started working on this back in February, but got side tracked with HPB bot stuff and the Half-Life 1.1.0.9 update, but I'll get back to working on the monster plugin over the next couple of weekends.

botman do you think after your done adding monsters in, you could add stuff like teleports if the mod doesn't have them?

I'm not sure that many people would just want to add teleporters to a MOD that doesn't support them.  Which MOD doesn't support teleporters?

That was just an example, if the mod doesn't support some thing cool can you add it?

Example:

func_train
Helicopters
xen_trees
Other types of xen_ things

I'll think of more... Also when you get around to adding humans (scientist, barney) will you add the gman? I think he'll be a good target :)

With enough time and effort you could probably create just about anything in a MOD.

I do plan to add the military grunts, scientists, g-man, barney and ninja assassin babes to the monster plugin.  Hopefully I'll get some time to work on it this weekend.  Maybe I'll get enough done to release a beta version in the next few weeks.

I've got functioning grunts in TFC, they do pretty much everything except throw grenades.

If you are interested the screenshot page featuring it is here.

I've got grunts that throw grenades, so NYAH!  ;D

The only problem is that I've modified the AI schedules somewhat and every once in a while sparks appear over their heads (the spark shower is used by the AI code to indicate when a schedule has failed, like trying to find cover when there isn't any way to find any cover because of no info_nodes).
