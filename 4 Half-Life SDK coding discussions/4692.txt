I just want the player not to be affected by gravity, without having to change the global gravity.

Alright, in player.cpp under the player spawn "void CBasePlayer::Spawn( void )"
a lot of variables in the player structure are set, one of them being the gravity.
I've tried changing this to 0 and get no result, the player is still affected by gravity... so I figure it's the movetype, I change that to MOVETYPE_FLY and still nothing. I can only assume these things are just initialized by the spawn function but are later determined by outside criteria... but hell if I can find them, a simple search through mp.dll returns sparse mentions of gravity, most of them not dealing with the player.
Maybe I don't quite understand what these definitions are used for, and maybe I'm not even looking in the right place. 

Any help would be great.

All of the physics (including gravity) is handled in the pm_shared folder .c files.  The physics is run on both the server and the client (it gets built into both DLL using the same code) since the client needs to simulate what's happening on the server.

You'll need to make your changes in the pm_shared .c code and rebuild both the server and the client.
