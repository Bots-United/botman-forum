I am trying to declare a global variable that will be used in both client and server dlls, but I am not sure where to declare it.

Aha, I suspect that's one of the cases where you'll need the weird Win32 stuff like GLOBAL_ALLOC and GLOBAL_LOCK... But I don't know for sure, better ask someone else (OK, I stop spamming!)

There is NO SUCH THING as a global variable that's available to the client AND the server.  The client and the server run on separate machines.  You can't have a single variable that's available to both.

If you want to have a variable that's CALLED the same thing on both the client and the server, you can put in somewhere in the pm_shared code since this is included in the server DLL and the client DLL, but writing a value to this variable on the server WON'T show up on the client and vice-versa.

mh, I think the guy wanted to know a method to share variables between DLLs but LOCALLY, kinda like we share variables between source files using the 'extern' keyword... I don't think he wanted his variable to be sent through the network wire :)

I suspect that by "server DLL" he meant "game DLL", simply that...

thats correct Pierre-Marie Baty. I am sorry if i have confused you by saying server dll instead of game dll.

You can do this by placing the variable in a shared data segment.

In the link optons for both projects add in something like this:

/section:MyAppsDS,rws 

MyAppsDS can be any name.

Now define your variable(s) inside of the shared data segment like this.

// put window handle in its own data segment, and share it with all instances
// this requires /section:MyAppsDS,rws in the project options

#pragma data_seg( "MyAppsDS" )
HWND g_hMainWnd = 0;
#pragma data_seg()
