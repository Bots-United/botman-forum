hi again

is it possible to implement the single player save feature into MP , like if you were playing a "couter-terrorism mod with various guns and money" and wanted to save your 'character'. 
and then the file could be saved in a directory and loaded each time you go online?

you can make your own proc for this. For example 
void SaveToFile(*char szFileName);


and write there code to implement file saving
for example (as it should be in Delphi);

blockwrite(file, players_model_fname, sizeof(players_model_fname));
blockwrite(file, players_weapons_count,sizeof(players_weapons_count));
blockwrite(file,weapon_index1,4);
etc...

You would probably do better to use something like MySQL on the server and store the player's information using the WONid as the key for the SQL record.

the way hoax says it, it is saved on the clients computer, but the way botman says it (the best way) the info will be stored on the server, and it will work with wonids
