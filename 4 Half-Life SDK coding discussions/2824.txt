Hi everybody, I have a few questions about some stuff:

1) The code references things like m_pPlayer and m_rgAmmo all the time - where do I find their definitions?

2) How do I set a client's movement speed?

3) Does anyone know a mod team that release their source code with the mod?

<edit>
4) What's an edict?

5) How do you check the passage of time?
</edit>

Thanks very much everybody

1) The code references things like m_pPlayer and m_rgAmmo all the time - where do I find their definitions?


m_pPlayer has a definition of the player in CBasePlayerItem

(class CBasePlayerItem : public CBaseAnimating)

CBasePlayerWeapon is a class of CBasePlayerItem

m_rgAmmo is in the class (class CWeaponBox : public CBaseEntity)

These are both found in weapons.h

2) How do I set a client's movement speed?

I dunno how to do it for one player, its probably easy, for the whole server though check out movevars.

3) Does anyone know a mod team that release their source code with the mod?

Check planethalflife.com mods page for "jailbreak open source", i think its released the source because its called "...open source" :)

4) What's an edict?

A thing :) like a monster, player, light, explosion. everything except walls really :) The source uses the term (CBasePlayer/CBaseMonster)->edict() for the "entvars" properties of an edict.

5) How do you check the passage of time?

gpGlobals->time is the time passed in the game.

It has to be for one person =<

So an edict is basically an entity (in Worldcraft terms)?
In a post by Botman (I forget which one) he refers to something 'having an edict' - how does that work?

5) How do you check the passage of time?

gpGlobals->time is the time passed in the game.

In seconds?

Thanks very much!

4) Yeah sorta. Having an edict may mean something having an edict_t pointer to it or something. (Like pContainingEntity pointer in CBasePlayer->pev)

5) Yep

Ok...  that I didn't understand at all...  dumbass explanation?

"btw, is there some reason why I'm not getting many replies?"

Most of the questions you are asking are pretty basic stuff.  You might want to start by reading through many of the tutorials on Half-Life coding websites.  This will help you to understand how things work in the SDK.  See my MOD FAQ web page for URLs to these websites (links on those sites will lead you to others).

Also, for generic Half-Life coding questions you'll get much better responses by posting on the dynamic.gamespy.com/~wavelength/ib/ikonboard.cgiWavelength coding forum.
