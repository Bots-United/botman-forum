Each weapon has a specific index in the HUD. The weapon code should contain its Slot numbers, Weapon index, ammo and all of that. You should have in weapons.h:

code:


#define WEAPON_NONE                        0
#define WEAPON_CROWBAR                  1
#define      WEAPON_GLOCK                  2
#define WEAPON_PYTHON                  3
#define WEAPON_MP5                        4
#define WEAPON_CHAINGUN                  5
#define WEAPON_CROSSBOW                  6
#define WEAPON_SHOTGUN                  7
#define WEAPON_RPG                        8
#define WEAPON_GAUSS                  9
#define WEAPON_EGON                        10
#define WEAPON_HORNETGUN            11
#define WEAPON_HANDGRENADE            12
#define WEAPON_TRIPMINE                  13
#define      WEAPON_SATCHEL                  14
#define      WEAPON_SNARK                  15




You can add extras in there like:

code:


#define WEAPON_SUPER_COOL_WIZZBANG_GUN  16




The weapon slots and indexes are also there, and you just need to add your weapons name and add an index there :D


Hope this helped

Do a case insensitive search the SDK source code (cl_dll and dlls folders) for "slot".  You'll find lots of places where it's used and this will give you the code that needs to be changed.

Also note that in the config.cfg file you will need to add a bind for slot6, slot7, slot8, and slot9 since the only thing in there by default is...
code:
bind "1" "slot1"
bind "2" "slot2"
bind "3" "slot3"
bind "4" "slot4"
bind "5" "slot5"

I believe they are

code:


m_iSlot;
m_iPosition;




:)
