Sorry for the off topic post but I have searched everywhere for this.

I want to create a script that does the following: 

rcon pb "addbot 10 2 1 CT" 

My problem is how do you get the script to send the quotes as part of the command? 

Bind "a" "rcon pb "addbot 10 2 1 CT" " 
Doesn't work.

You shouldn't need the quotes in the middle.

rcon "pb addbot 10 2 1 CT"

...should work.

Both HPB and POD bot act differently with / without the quotes.
With the quotes both act as expected but without the quotes
both POD and HPB bot ignore the mp_autoteambalance setting and balance the teams,
sort of.

For example:
On a dedicated CS server with 
mp_limitteams 0
mp_autoteambalance 0

I joined the CT team and was the only player to start.
Typing:
rcon HPB_bot "addbot 2 1 CTBot 5"
rcon HPB_bot "addbot 2 1 CTBot 5"
rcon HPB_bot "addbot 2 1 CTBot 5"

Gave me three CT bots.


I joined the CT team and was the only player to start.
Typing the command without the quotes:
rcon HPB_bot addbot 2 1 CTBot 5
rcon HPB_bot addbot 2 1 CTBot 5
rcon HPB_bot addbot 2 1 CTBot 5       
                              
gave me three T bots!

Typing                              
rcon HPB_bot addbot 2 1 CTBot 5       
once more gave me a CT bot.


POD has almost identical behavior.
But it seems to alternate between 
adding a t or ct bot every other command.
    
      
So that is why I was trying to find out how to add quotes as part of 
a script. The command doesn't work correctly without the quotes regardless
if it typed in to the console directly or sent by a script.

What this means is you cannot use the addbot command from a script (unless you can have the " character as part of the script.)

In case you don't know: for most bots that were based on botman's template, bot server commands are not real commands the bot DLL would have registered using REG_SVR_COMMAND(), but instead it's just a CVAR containing a string that gets blankened out each frame. The bot DLL checks this CVAR, and in case it's not void (a string has been set in), it executes the command that's in using SERVER_COMMAND(). Ugly, but simple. That could be one of the reasons why some bots' commands are touchy with quotes. Dunno if that helps to work out something around...

You should be putting the quote marks around the WHOLE string of text to make is appear as a single command.  The first quote should appear after the 'rcon' command and the second quote should appear at the end of the line, like this...

rcon "HPB_bot addbot 2 1 CTBot 5"

botman

Either way I still cannot create a script that 
does an addbot command because the quotes need to be sent as part of the command.

So the first question remains.
(I have asked this question in several of the main forums and not received an answer. I have searched all the main CS scripting sites and not found an answer.)

1) how do you create scripts that SEND the quote character to the server AS PART OF THE COMMAND?

2) Another way to phrase this question using an example.  How would I create an addbot script for HPB bot? All I want it to do is create a script that does the equivalent of 

rcon "HPB_bot addbot 2 1 CTBot 5" 

I am just about ready to create an addbot command as part of a metamod utility I am creating, since it seems like this cannot be done via a script...

All of this applies to Counter Strike.
Thanks.
