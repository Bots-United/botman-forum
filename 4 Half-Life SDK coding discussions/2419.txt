Couldn't get GiveFnptrsToDll is an export problem with that function.

If you are using MingW32 make SURE you copy the GiveFnpt.dat file into the dlls directory before running make to build the mp.dll file (use "make clean", then "make" to rebuild everything after copying the GiveFnpt.dat file).

If you are using the Borland compiler, make SURE you have the bcc_mp.def file in the dlls directory before running make to build the mp.dll file.

It's probably having problems with the .def file.  Use "make clean" then "make" to rebuild everything.  If that doesn't work then you might want to uninstall everything and start over (perhaps one of your files are missing or corrupted).  GO SLOW and READ the directions VERY CAREFULLY.

Yep, make clean will remove the object files (.o), the def file (.def) and the DLL file (.dll).

Then if you run "make" it should (hopefull) build the DLL.

FYI, If you are running this on Win2000, other people have reported problems with MingW32 on Win2k.  I don't have Win2K so I can't help you there.  If you can find a copy of Win95 or Win98 you might want to reformat your hard drive and load one of those instead.
