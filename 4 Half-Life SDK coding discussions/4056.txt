Did you try e-mailing the coder for WormsHL?

Did you understand what I explained you by email ?
"menuselect" is not always the necessary ClientCommand for selecting an option in the VGUI menu. It can be whatever other ClientCommand as well (such as "jointeam", "buy", or whatever).
Just monitor player ClientCommands and have the bots send the same ones as soon as they receive the "VGUIMenu" network message (or whatever usermsg this MOD uses for VGUI menu display).

BTW. I received an email from you, but its content was empty. Since I doubt this was on purpose, you might want to send it back again.

Thanks, here is the content of my precedent mail.

I met them (wormshl coders), and i am looking for the source code of their mod. (No menuselect).

They didn't put any other command for jointeam or change skin ! These functions are not monitored by the VGUI but coded into.

I can't do anything without using VGUI commands (and without changing a lot of their source code).

PM i just look at your/my reply thanks
