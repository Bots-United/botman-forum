Just "give" them the suit to start off with.  That's what deathmatch does.

Huh ? I understood he wanted just the contrary ?

If you're writting a MOD, don't give your players any stuff when they start off, else if you're writting a plugin DLL, use the player_weaponstrip entity on the player's spawn point.

yer m8, i understand just giving them the hev suit, but blue shift works around an armor based health-thingie, not a hev suit, then theres re programming all of the blabble that is said when the HEV suit is picked up :S wouldnt it be easier making a VGUI HUD? but the thing is, i aint no C++ programmer, so i will need to follow some tutorial, unless sum is so kind to help me along with this mod? programming wise! :D cheers
