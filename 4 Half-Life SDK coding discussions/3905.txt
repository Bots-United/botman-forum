Is there a way to create sub class distinctions?
example;  scout--->scout_a

Sure, just inherit from CBasePlayer...
code:
class CScout : public CBasePlayer
{
   // scout specific stuff here
};

class CMedic : public CBasePlayer
{
   // medic specific stuff here
};

class CSoldier : public CBasePlayer
{
   // soldier specific stuff here
};

I think I see the error of my question. With that in mind I will come clean with the meat of my entire problem and hopefully you will see it in your heart to help me.  I am looking to make a multiplayer phantasy roll playing mod. As far as the class structure question i posted earlier, my query was directed at using the class system as a character creation process.  An example of what i mean is along the lines of;  you pick a mage, then body type, (model).  I am trying to have 7 different classes for players to pick ie; fighter, mage, cleric, thief, ranger, necromancer, beast.  The next step from those choices are the different player models.
Like this; fighter-->good_large  
           fighter-->good_medium
           fighter-->good_small
           fighter-->neutral_large  
           fighter-->neutral_medium
           fighter-->neutral_small
           fighter-->evil_large  
           fighter-->evil_medium
           fighter-->evil_small
           mage-->good_large  
           mage-->good_medium
           mage-->good_small
           mage-->neutral_large  
           mage-->neutral_medium
           mage-->neutral_small
           mage-->evil_large  
           mage-->evil_medium
           mage-->evil_small
           cleric-->good_large  
           cleric-->good_medium
           cleric-->good_small
           cleric-->neutral_large  
           cleric-->neutral_medium
           cleric-->neutral_small
           cleric-->evil_large  
           cleric-->evil_medium
           cleric-->evil_small
           thief-->good_large  
           thief-->good_medium
           thief-->good_small
           thief-->neutral_large  
           thief-->neutral_medium
           thief-->neutral_small
           thief-->evil_large  
           thief-->evil_medium
           thief-->evil_small
           ranger-->good_large  
           ranger-->good_medium
           ranger-->good_small
           ranger-->neutral_large  
           ranger-->neutral_medium
           ranger-->neutral_small
           ranger-->evil_large  
           ranger-->evil_medium
           ranger-->evil_small
           necromancer-->good_large  
           necromancer-->good_medium
           necromancer-->good_small
           necromancer-->neutral_large  
           necromancer-->neutral_medium
           necromancer-->neutral_small
           necromancer-->evil_large  
           necromancer-->evil_medium
           necromancer-->evil_small
           beast-->good_large  
           beast-->good_medium
           beast-->good_small
           beast-->neutral_large  
           beast-->neutral_medium
           beast-->neutral_small
           beast-->evil_large  
           beast-->evil_medium
           beast-->evil_small           The reason i said class because i am trying to do this mod with no real "teams".  I also need to find out how to use the player's name to save the game. In saving the game i mean with the use of a save command in the console or binded to a key.  The information i am trying to save is class, model, weapons, armor, health, items, money, and overall kills/deaths. The only other thing i can think of is, how to have the gui come up only on a new player name or a changeclass comand in the console or binded to a key once the character has been saved.  i would appreciate any help. I have everything else about my mod figured out except for these crucial snags.  Thank you much for your time and effort.

If your "large", "medium" and "small" are player sizes (i.e. effect the bounding box size), you will not be able to support ducking (which is probably okay) because the Half-Life engine will only support 4 hulls sizes (one of those being a "point" hull, or traceline which is a single point in size).

You can create a small player model, a medium player model and a large player model each with a different bounding box size (you'll also have to change the hulls.txt file used to compile the map when doing this, see Zoner's Half-Life tools for details).

Each player model can have multiple skins (or body groups).  Take a look at the scientist's head or the human military grunt bodies as an example of a single model having different "bodies".  This requires different body groups in the model's .qc file.  There should be some Half-Life modeling tutorial websites that talk about different body groups (use www.google.com to find them).

i see what you are saying.  i am not attempting to scale the whole model.  and is also not really pertaining to my question.  
1.  i need to have a class gui come up when the player joins with a new name or uses the change class command, (in reference to the save feature below).
2.  i need the gui to say;
fighter
mage
cleric
thief
ranger
necromancer
beast
3.  from any of those selections i need a gui to include  9 different class specific model types so if the player picks fighter they will have a second choice of fighter specific models;
model 1
model 2
model 3
model 4
model 5
model 6
model 7
model 8
model 9
4.  i am also trying to find out how to have a multiplayer save function that works ingame with the command "save"  with the info to be saved using the players name. i would like it to save;
class
model
armor
money
health
weapons
items
kills
deaths
the loading of a character is to be done when ever you join server or use a "changename" command. naturaly i would like the gui to only appear when a player name does not match a save file or when the change class function is used.  i  am certain these are coding questions.  i am trying to build a mod with player character growth.  i appreciate any help you afford me.
i feel this whole save thing is possible because of the way hl already uses it in custom.  for 2 if you could just give me an example of how to do a gui with the choices of; 
fighter
mage
and for 3 the choices of;
fighter-->, (chosen in the first gui)
model 1, (fighter specific model)
model 2, (fighter specific model)
mage-->, (chosen in the first gui)
model 1, (mage specific model)
model 2, (mage specific model)
i can do the work of repeating the processes to include everything else.  i have done the tutorial online about the gui but i am trying to not have teams for a choice just classes and then thier respective models.

There are various VGUI coding tutorials on Half-Life coding websites.  Try using www.google.com to search for "half-life vgui tutorial" or something similar.
