Hi
I have tested several HL/CS bots (HPB, TeamBot, PMBot, ...) with Visual C++ and I've got a problem.
When I launch HL with CS mod from Visual C++, the game perform several StartFrame and then exit properly as if I typed 'exit' in the console ...
I cannot debug CS bot from Visual !!
There is no problem with other mods like Valve deathmath or TeamFortress, everything is ok, debugging is possible.
Is it normal ??
where am I wrong ?

Thx
loïc

It is like that although I dunno why :-(

I'd suggest debugging through a dedicated server (using HLDS) and then connecting to it through your local machine.

There are more posts about this in the bot developer forum but forgot where they are! :(

I can give you a solution that works for me.
It is tested on about 22 mods including counter strike.

1. go to project->settings and select the DEBUG tab.
2. in the executable part - browse for your hl.exe
3. working directory - your halflife dir (not the mod dir)
4. program arguments looks like this:
hl.exe -game cstrike -console +sv_lan 1 +maxplayers 20 -toconsole -sw +map de_dust.bsp

the -sw part will make hl run in a window and that should stop the problem you mentioned.

as I said, your hl will run in a window, making it easy to debug or whatever you need to do.

debugging HLDS with CS is possible. It is enough to work !!

thx
