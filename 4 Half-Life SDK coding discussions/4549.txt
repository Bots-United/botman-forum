What can i do with version-conflict of HL.EXE and MP.DLL? An old EXE doesn't support a new DLL and vice versa. Should i distribute several DLLs for my MOD?

There is ALWAYS only one up-to-date version of the Half-Life executable (hl.exe).

You should always make your MOD, bots, plugins, whatever support the most recent release of hl.exe.  Whether you support older releases of the game (and older releases of the SDK) is completely up to you.  Most people ONLY support the most up-to-date version of hl.exe.
