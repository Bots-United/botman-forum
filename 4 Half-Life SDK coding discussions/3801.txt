I'm trying to make some weapons while I learn c++, I finally got my sniperrifle to compile with no errors but when I type give weapon_sniperrifle in my console it gives me an error saying sv_modelindex model models/sniperrifle.mdl not precached.

PRECACHE_MODEL("models/sniperrifle.mdl");

Should work but doesn't, any ideas?

Yes I did that, but still nothing.
Maybe I'll start smaller, thx for your help though.
