hi all
i made some changes to the swing function in CCrowbar entity and rebuilt hl.dll. Even after replacing the old hl.dll with the new one, i am not able to see the changes i made. but i am able to see changes that i made to other functions like ActivateButton.

thanks

Are you building BOTH the server DLL and the client DLL?  If not, you won't see any animation changes.

The server doesn't actually swing the crowbar, the client does.

Are your changes in the pm_shared folder?  If so, rebuild the client DLL and try it again.

sorry about the confusion. what i meant was hl.dll. I am making changes to crowbar.cpp file in C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\SDK\Single-Player Source\dlls folder.
