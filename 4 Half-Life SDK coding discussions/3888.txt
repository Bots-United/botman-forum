This is really odd... When I used sdk 2.3 and visual c++ 6 I could add weapons with no problem.
To get the old scoreboard I got the 2.2 sdk and the novgui patches along with the Borland compiler. I made my .cpp file for the weapon, precached it in weapons.cpp and added it to weapons.h but when I go into the game and type...


developer 2
give weapon_bio

it says... NULL ENT in givenameditem

I reload the map with developer 2 on and at the top it says... 

Cannot create entity weapon_bio and
Cannot create entity building_sentry (something else that isnt working)

Its probably something stupid im overlooking but I've never had this trouble before.

Are you building the DLL with the Borland compiler?

If so you need to add new entities to the bcc_mp.def (or bcc_hl.def) linker definition file.

The Borland compiler will export functions with a leading underscore in the name and the Half-Life engine won't be able to find them (i.e. weapon_shotgun becomes _weapon_shotgun).  See the end of the ReadMe.txt file included with the SDK 2.2 patches about using the Borland compiler.

If you have the MSVC compiler, you should just use it instead.

Ok, I'll try that...
Im not using the MS compiler because it is the introductory edition and since Im using a server and a client dll I have to click on that annoying screen twice. Thanks for the help.
