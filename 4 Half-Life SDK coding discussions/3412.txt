Subject: Running HL not-maximized!

I changed some settings in hl.dsw.
ALT + F7->Debug and set Paramenters to:
-game frontline -developer -console -sw

It will run Half-Life not maximized, how do I remove it? (I even tried to reinstall my Half-Life).

In one of the menus (Video Settings, I think) is a check box for running in windowed mode (it only appears when you have developer set).  Uncheck it and it will run in full screen mode.

or remove -sw from your commandline ...

when developing under Win9x, sw mode is often the only thing to do if you don't want a bug in your code to mess up the whole OS because of the bad OpenGL implementation. For example, if I play in GL mode, I am unable to switch to the code and back to the game, the computer freezes. Shitty hardware ? dunno...

btw, congratulations for your bot Johannes, the aiming is awesome ! (apart from some bugs left) how did you do it ?

I often also debug in software mode, that loads faster and hasnt this (NVidida?) opengl bug.

*looking up my 'old' sources ... *

quite simple ...
code:

current = pEdict->v.v_angle.x;
      
      ideal = pEdict->v.idealpitch;
      
      float a=f_AMomentum,idealSpeed,c=f_ASpeed,aNow;
      
      idealSpeed = (ideal - current);
      idealSpeed = idealSpeed*c;
      aNow = exp(log(a) * g_msecval / 50.f);
      fViewSpeedPitch = fViewSpeedPitch*aNow + idealSpeed*(1.f-aNow);      // a+b=1, etwa a = 0.8, b=0.2
      
      current += fViewSpeedPitch * (g_msecval/50.f);

first it was *guesswhose* - yes, you are right, once again tobias' idea. I already knew this momentum stuff from neural nets, but somehow i havnt had the idea to use that with the view too ...
i'm not sure if i'm right with the frame stuff, but I hope so. at least it's working, although it's not working with really low fps ( << 10 )

Got it working with mine, looks like that (slightly tuned)
code:

   pBot->v_aim_speed.y = pBot->v_aim_speed.y * exp (log (0.7) * pBot->msecval / 50)
                         + v_deviation.y * 0.1 * (1 - exp (log (0.35) * pBot->msecval / 50));
   pBot->v_aim_speed.x = pBot->v_aim_speed.x * exp (log (0.7) * pBot->msecval / 50)
                         + v_deviation.x * 0.1 * (1 - exp (log (0.35) * pBot->msecval / 50));

   // move the aim cursor
   pBot->pEdict->v.v_angle = UTIL_WrapAngles (pBot->pEdict->v.v_angle
                                              + Vector (pBot->v_aim_speed.x * (pBot->msecval / 50),
                                                        pBot->v_aim_speed.y * (pBot->msecval / 50),
                                                        0) * aim_speed_factor); 


...and guess what ? Remember Paulo-La-Frite aimbug fix ? It was about inverting v_angle.x after the body angles were set... well, this bug fix is actually itself a bug ! In fact it was a counter-measure to correct a bug someone did earlier (TheFatal or botman, don't know) in the bot framework. I had to get rid of it, else my bots' pitch was oscillating increasingly to infinity !!!
