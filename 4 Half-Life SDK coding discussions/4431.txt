Hi :)

I have tried to set an temp entity (TE_BEAMFOLLOW) on a spectator to show other players, where are all specs flying at the moment, but the beam can be seen only by other spectators and not by alive players. If i set it on an alive player, all are able to see a beam.
Another tempents like TE_PLAYERATTACHMENT work  the same way.

I guess the engine acts that way but i would glad understand why.

I think the engine works this way: only the positions of the players are updated by the server for all players, so every player in the session has the current position of player, who are alive. The positions of the dead players are only updated for other dead players...

I'm not sure this is what you want, if it works for TFC, or how it's done, or http://amxmod.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=83378.
