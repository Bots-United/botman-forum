Subject: a question for my mod... about weapon spawn point

I want to make for example, on the spawn point of the egon gun, a random spawn between the egon and the rpg... or else, a cicling spawn point (first spawn egon, next rpg, next egon.. etc).

If anyone wanna tell me... thank you!

Just do multiple spawn points (one for the weapon you want) at the same location, and in your code only allow the weapon to spawn if no other one is at that same location (you can easily get a pointer to these entities by issuing a FIND_ENTITY_IN_SPHERE within a low radius around your spawn point).
