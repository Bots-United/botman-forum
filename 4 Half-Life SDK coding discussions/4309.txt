I was wondering if there was any copyright stuff I need to worry about before releasing a singleplayer mod just for other peoples enjoyment (not for sale). like for instance say I create a mod based on a movie, or a show, and i use sounds from the movie or models representing the characters, is this copyright infringement? or do i need permission from somebody to do this?

you should always get permission.

BUT... Most people don't and in the majority of the cases nothing happens.

Ask permission by email (etc) state it's a mod, non-money making in anyway, and make it out as it won't effect their sales. 
If they don't reply then in the readme appologies and say you tried to get permission.

Or the sod it approach is just do it. It's non money making and the worst that could happen is they demand you stop the mod (insidence where someone made a monkey island shareware game and LUCAS Arts told them to pack it in) and the only loss is your teams time.

Good luck

the mod is based on a show from the 70's and it only ran a few years. i wouldnt even know who to contact to get permission now. ill have to do some more research i guess
