Common Problems....

Another common issue is getting client 100 error no client present, i havnt seen what's causing this error but i belive that its caused by a similar error by people misplacing the code into a different file than supposed to, if anyone finds out what mistake they made to get this error, please notify me and tell me what you did wrong and how you fixed it.....

Usually when you get the "Not present on client" error you have used a different case (or slightly different name) for the name of the network message.  For example using...

REG_USER_MSG("TeamNames", -1);

...on the server and using...

HOOK_MESSAGE(Teamnames);

...on the client (notice the 'n' isn't uppercase).

Check your message names on the server and client and make sure they match EXACTLY.

in player.cpp

line 234 

you see

gmsgTeamNames = REG_USER_MSG( "TeamNames", -1 );

just mark it as comment //

like this
//gmsgTeamNames = REG_USER_MSG( "TeamNames", -1 );

now it should work and work with your teamnames.

it has something to do i think with sending the TeamNames message to the clients. cuz this there are 2 gmsg's that got sended to a client and the client doesn't know how to handle, so it better to disable the first one. so it uses your code!

Also see this website that finalizes the tuturial:
http://elife.5u.com/teamstutorialsdk22.html

hope this will help you

well ignore this. i found out the problem. dont make your team names to long :) team 2's name was to long so it caused it to not match up in PlayerSpawn(). so to all of u that might fall into the same problem later checkout the length of the names. i think it cant be more then like 15 chars.

Network message names (like the "TeamNames" shown in the above example) can be no longer than 12 characters.  Anything over that will cause the engine to return 0 for the network message ID value (from REG_USER_MSG).  0 is an invalid network message ID.
