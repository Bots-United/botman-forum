I usually work things out for myself eventually but I just thought I'd post anyway -

I've setup a new action called leap

+leap
-leap

in the client dll, but the compiler says my definition IN_LEAP is not defined. I can't seem to find where all the others are defined (IN_JUMP etc) to edit this value to make sure it all works... any ideas where the key flags are defined?
