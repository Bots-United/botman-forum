i don't think it's possible or of any use for that matter if it is possible.. single-player has a story-board and can be saved for each chapter, like saving player and/or entities positions and health and stuff. usually each chapter begins with a new map. while multiplayer games.. what's there to save ? saving gamestate is client-side, and it is not appropriate to save the same game for each clients connecting on a multiplayer game, also wasting download time during connecting to the server to make sure every clients have the same game.

It is still possible though, to implement and use a "third-party" save/restore manager, that would work server-side only. For example, a MOD that would feature sorta role-play ala Might and Magic, could let a player save its equipment, health, mana, magic and so on, and have him to load it upon connection.

all i really need to know is how to save client side in multiplayer game play.  if someone can figure out how to bypass the no save clause in mp mode please tell me.  if there is an external save program that can be used in conjuntion i would be greatfull to know.  i have figured out how to bypass the unwanted info like position and crap with the CRestore class, (so it dont load) but what i really need is how to "trick" the game
into letting it save.  with some of the stuff i have seen on this sight, i just thought if i could find the answer it would be here.  the name of the party that gives me the answer will be included in the mod credits if they want.

you can load in multiplayer and it forces the load map.  you make a struct to filter out any instances of unwanted load data ie anything you dont want to point to the CRestore class.  the save is a function that buffers the data then writes the data to a file.  the only real problem is the argument in the source code that disables the save/autosave. i can not find it but there must be one for it to be disabled, ie "cant save in multiplayer games".
