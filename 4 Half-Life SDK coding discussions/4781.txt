hi all
I have added a piece of code in "void CBaseMonster :: MonsterInit ( void )" to record system time when a moster is spawned. when i tried t oprint out "pev->classname" & "pev->model", they were large integers. are they memory locations for the actual classnam and model? or some thing?

thanks in advance.

they are offsets in memory from a list of strings held in gpGlobals->pStringBase, no need to know that though, you can get the string of it from STRING(pev->classname) or STRING(pev->model) etc.

For speed purposes, Half-Life uses a "string table", i.e. an array in memory where all the constant strings are stored, and to which they are accessed and written to only by their pointer. It's the string_t typedef you see here and there.

There are macros that must be used to get to the original string from its pointer, and vice-versa. Look for the usage of STRING(), MAKE_STRING() and ALLOC_STRING().
