I seem to get an Invalid DLL warning and then Half-Life crashes. I have not modified the sdk, I am using Borland 5.5, I followed Botman's read me file to a "T", I must add I am using a registered Half-Life game straight out of the box. I add that cause maybe I just need the latest update? I have tried for one solid week but no success. I created a back up copy of everything like Botman recommended so I am sure one of you smart puppies can help me out easily :) Oh and Botman you rock ;)

You probably do need to update. The later engine updates might have some new functions that are not in the older ones.

Hmmm .....wondering if I must build the client.dll as well? I have searched every page here in this forum and I am beginning to think I must build the client as well. Providing the information I read was correct the weapons are held in the client. What boggles me is what in the hell does that have to do with an invalid dll message. Botman .... your services please :)
I will download the update tonight but I will not install it till Botman replies for fear I will screw it all up ;)

Further research into the tfc folder smashes that idea of the client. Tfc has only one dll and that is tfc.dll, Yet CS has a client.dll and a mp.dll. Oh my I am getting dizzy ........

You need to upgrade. If you don't have a client dll in your mod's directory, it will use the one in the valve folder. Since yours is out of date, it won't work.
