I've compiled client.dll from SDK2.2 and inserted it into my MOD. My mod has HL.DLL written on Borland C++ from SDK2.0. When the game starts (after console appeared) it crashes - windows desktop appears and nothing... What should I do?

You will need to build the client DLL and the server DLL (mp.dll or hl.dll) with the SAME version of the SDK.

I didn't think there was any changes with exports in the game/server dll for sdk 2.0 to sdk 2.2

There are differences in the ways that weapons are handled (since SDK 2.2 has all of the weapons predicted client side).
