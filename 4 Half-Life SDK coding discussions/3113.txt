Well, I always get this error since I have added a new weapon. I don't know why it says that, because to my knowledge, my code is completely correct. Any suggestions on how to get rid of it?

You must be spawning the weapon over and over and over, using up all the edicts.  Double check your code to make sure you're not spawning something more than once.
