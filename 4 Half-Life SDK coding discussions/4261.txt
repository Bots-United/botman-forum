Ok, while digging in the SDK I found these:

#define RGB_YELLOWISH 0x00FFA000 //255,160,0
#define RGB_REDISH 0x00FF1010 //255,160,0

Surely the last to numbers of red can't be 160 and 0. What are the actual values? Is it a 10?
Because right now I'm messing the colour system a little and I would like to try something new. Thanks in advance.

Maybe it's on purpose... it says not "red", but "redish" :)

Hi

It seems the comments are wrong:
YELLOWISH is 255 (FF), 160 (A0), 0 (00)
REDISH is 255 (FF), 16 (10), 16 (10)

The first byte of the 4 is probably the alpha component (transparency), hence
redish: 0x00ffa000 (alpha 0, red 255, green 160, blue 0)
yellowish: 0x00ff1010 (alpha 0, red 255, green 16, blue 16)
