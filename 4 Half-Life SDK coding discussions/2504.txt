There are three maps in the mods maps folder..but when starting a game there are no maps listed to start.

I did make sure that the inline function expansion was disabled and tried take some of the maps fromthe vavle directory but it just does not display any.

Any Idea's?

If these are custom maps you'll need to make sure that you specify a player spawn entity in the liblist.gam file and that there is at least one of these entities in the map .bsp file.  For example, Half-Life deathmatch has this in the liblist.gam file...

mpentity "info_player_deathmatch"

...and the multiplayer spawn points are "info_player_deathmatch".
