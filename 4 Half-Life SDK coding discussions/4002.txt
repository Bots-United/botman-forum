I want to remove a few weapons from half-life completely. I tried and the whole thing had a fit. I removed the weapons from weapons.h and weapons.cpp and any refrence I found in gamerules.cpp but when I complied I got errors from all over. For example one was airtank.cpp over removing the granade.... Can anyone shed some light on this for me?

Sure, we can try to help, but with that much info it won't be easy though.

You'd better post the error messages from the compiler (if the build log is very long, just post the last lines), and a bunch of lines from the .cpp files the errors refer to, and we'll see what we can get.
