I was wondering if there was anybody here who has a little bit of time to give me a hand with my HL-MOD Add-on. I'm making a program to run in unison with the client-side of Half-Life multiplayer.  I only have 2 specific concerns. Feel free to email me at deadpath@punkassfraggers.com, or AIM me at PAFDeadPath, or post in these forums. ANY help at ALL will be most graciously appreciated.
Thank you for your time...

Well, it would surely help if you posted your "two specific concerns" here and maybe one can give you a hand :)

Ok, I'm making an Add-On for HL Mods. I'm using VC++ 6.0, and I need to integrate with the client side HL engine to access both the IP address being played at, and the current map name. I've never used the HL-SDK before, and was wondering if there was somebody who could help me through it.
