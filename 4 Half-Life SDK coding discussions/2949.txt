Sorry for being so annoying :/

But I'm lost on Borland compiling :(

I have done everything, made all the changes. Make the bat file BCC.BAT

I run the bat file but I don't get what to do next...

Stuff from your readme...

C:\Windows> D:
D:\> cd \Borland
D:\Borland> BCC.BAT

...Now change to the dlls directory where you installed the Valve SDK...

D:\Borland> cd "\Half-Life\SDK\Source Code\dlls"

(notice the double quotes in the above command, they are necessary!!!)

...then run "make" (without quotes) to build the DLL file..

D:\Half-Life\SDK\Source Code\dlls> make


Where do I put this? I tried putting it in MS-Dos but it doesn't do anything.

Please help.

Thanks for your time.

What sort of SDK have you got ? Mine has no space in the name "SourceCode"...
Open a dos box, change directory to the directory where you installed your SDK, and issue a "cd SourceCode\dlls", then make.

The BCC.BAT file sets up the PATH environment variable so that MS-DOS can find the Borland applications (like make and bcc).

After setting up the PATH environment, you change to the directory where the SDK source code was installed to (that's what the "cd" MS-DOS command does).

Once you are in the SDK dlls folder, you run "make" (without the quotes) to build the DLL file from the SDK source code.

"Where do I put this?"

You just type those lines in on the keyboard and press the ENTER key.  :)

If you are getting some kind of error message, you should post the error message here and someone will help you figure out what is going wrong.

Thanks botman & Pierre-Marie Baty for your help.
I got it working :)

But I also have a few more questions about the mp.dll

I want to change a model and a few sounds for a MPlayer gun. Since the gun is preached clients will download it if they don't have it right?

What happens if they got sv_allowdownload 0

Will they have problems? 

Also rcon is a MPlayer command right? Do you know which file it is located in? I'm thinking of changing it around.

Thanks for your help.

You should use www.planethalflife.com/wavelength coding forum for general MOD coding questions (you'll get many more responses there than here).

You can't change the "rcon" command since it's internal in the Half-Life engine (just like you can't change the "kick" command or the "map" command).  You don't have access to this code, so you can't change it.
