Hi. Where would I need to look in order to block rcon commands? Is this even possible?

Thanks :)

There is no generic engine interface for intercepting rcon console commands.

The engine will intercept many of the rcon commands and the game DLL will never see them.  Examples are "kick", "map", "status", etc.

The MOD game DLL can register other console commands using the pfnAddServerCommand() function.  You could insert your DLL between the engine and the game DLL (similar to the way the HPB bot does or metamod does) and when you see a game DLL register a console command, redirect that to your own code (i.e. the engine calls your code first, then your code calls the game DLL code).  When a command is issued that you want to block, simply let the engine call your function, but don't call the game DLL version of this function.
