Is it possible in one of botmans great bots to give the bots set waypoint, and have them stand there, until a player comes near, then run to next waypoint and repeat the same?

    Thanks

yeah it's pretty simple :)

Maybe you dhould write this in the bot developer forum (Instead of this one as it is mainly for SDK probss/solutions n stuff ;))
