Hi wow you get alota q's so ill make this fast umm well i have played a few matches on a server where people were being pretty rude (its my mod soo i was pissed i could not do anything)well i stopped updating them so there out of the loop but just in case i wanna make a secret command for my eyes only in the client.cpp so i can kick people even though im a client and not a host... ya sounds a lil power hungry but all that hard work i suppose i should have some controll wile others had fun this guy was ruining it and i want the mod to be as fun as possibel so check this out

else if (FStrEq(pcmd, "secret_kick" ))
      {
            GetClassPtr((CBasePlayer *)pev)->?????????();
      }

i know that kick is a host command cant find a trace of it in the code so i dont know how i would execute the command hey all thnx for reading this far :D hope to hear from you guys thnx

Use...

SERVER_COMMAND("whatever_server_command_you_want_here\n");

...make sure you don't forget the '\n' at the end.  So for kick it would be...

SERVER_COMMAND("kick Player1\n");
