well, I'm trying to make a command to change models in tfc, but I seem to keep failing.
I have tried it a few ways, but none of them seem to work, and one just crashes hl completely.
Can anyone here give me some advice?

The only command i know is 'model "model's name"'.
So to change to a medic, it's 'model medic'.
But I think that would be impossible though, the models are sort of 'locked. So you can't change them unless you change class.

yeah, that's what I want to do. Make a new command which would allow to use custom models.

you could cheat and use the same method as ChickenMod uses : fade out your player model so that it becomes invisible and no clipping, and create a new entity with the model you want to use just in place of that player. A bit complicated, especially for the movements, but it would work and everyone would be fooled.

yeah, but how can I make the model have my current weapon attached to it? and make it do the same animations as I would be supposed to?

hmmm... well, you'd have to create a bot in fact. Not quite what you want, or is it ?

nope :)
but I've seen it in a few serverside mods, and I doubt they make the player model dissappear and create a new model at its origin.
