Is there any possibility I could search through all private data of a player/bot? Example, I know that I'm looking for a classname of value 0x01daa10c (from pEdict->pvPrivateData + 0x????????) And I just need to find it!!! Is there anyway to do this?

Sure, just create a byte pointer in memory, recast it as the size you want and examine memory one address at a time...
code:
unsigned char *p;
 
p = whatever_address_you_want_here;
 
for (int index=0; index < number_of_bytes_you_want_to_search; index++)
{
   if (*(int *)p == int_to_search_for)
   {
      printf("found int at %08x\n", p);
   }
 
   if (*(float *)p == float_to_search_for)
   {
      printf("found float at %08x\n", p);
   }

   p++;  // increment the pointer
}

ok thats great!

Just an annoying prob, Ive not really messed about with mem locations a lot so what kind of value goes in 'p' ?

e.g. p = 0x00000658; is invalid

and whenever I try to put in somthing like

p = 04cd1a5d; that is invalid too

p will need to point to addresses that you have mapped to your process address space (otherwise you'll get an "access violation" error).

You can set p = pvPrivateData;
