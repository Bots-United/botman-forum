You could use fopen() to open the file, read until you find the line with "SPACE" and then parse that input to see what it's bound to, but that doesn't mean that someone didn't manually bind it to some other key using the console after the config.cfg file was executed.

There's no way that I'm aware of to determine which keys are bound to certain functions and you shouldn't care.  You code should only be concerned with "+jump" or "-jump" and react to those.  It shouldn't care whether the jump key is bound to "SPACE", "CTRL", "ENTER", F5, "PGDN" or any other key.
