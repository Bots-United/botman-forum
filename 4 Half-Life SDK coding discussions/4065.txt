I havent seen anything about this, Im looking for help on how to get the server to call a command in the game, ie, a client command

If you want to arbitrarily force a client to execute a command, you can use the server-sided clientcommand in g_engfuncs

code:

// make the player whose edict_t is pPlayerEdict execute the "command" clientcommand
(g_engfuncs.pfnClientCommand) (pPlayerEdict, "command\n");



If you want to run a SERVER command, i.e, a command as if you were typing it in the SERVER console, you can use the function for that purpose

code:

// execute the "command" server command on the server
SERVER_COMMAND ("command\n");



In both cases, don't forget to terminate the command line with a newline character (\n).

Documentation about engine and gamedll functions can be found in my RACC template source code here:
