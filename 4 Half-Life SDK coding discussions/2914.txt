Hi,
 
I would like to add a new input stream to HL via a camera that does some tracking. Initially I would be happy to just be able to walk around in HL given some body gestures that my tracker supports. But after spending some time with HL SDK I realize that I would greatly appreciate some more guidelines. 

I guess one alternative would be to open a socket and then use CL_CreateMove to initiate the movements in HL. Unfortunately have I not been able to decode how to actually use the CL_CreateMove command. Anyone that used this command or have an alternative suggestion?

On the other hand it seems to be a bit silly to open a new socket (even it seems to work) and I guess that it would be better to use the networking package and catch the messages from my camera via ConnectionlessPacket().  But here am I even further away from a solution. First - is it possible to talk to a single-user HL engine using this approach? Or do I need to initiate a multi-user environment? Secondly – any security issues to be particular concern about?

thanxs,
konrad

If you have a Windows API for the device you are using you can just use those functions to read data from the device.  You would probably want to modify inputw32.cpp and input.cpp in the client DLL source code to convert this device's input into something movement related in Half-Life.
