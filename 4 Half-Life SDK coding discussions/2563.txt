1. UTIL_TraceLine() and UTIL_FindEntityInSphere() probably take the most CPU time.  Do as few of these as you possibly can.  You might want to have a timer (i.e. float last_time = 0.0) and use the timer so that you don't do something during every single frame...
code:
if (last_time < gpGlobals->time)
{
   // update check time to 1/10th of a second from now
   last_time = gpGlobals->time + 0.1;
 
   // do the CPU expensive stuff here...

}

2. Read the ReadMe.txt file that comes with the HPB bot template source code.

3. The HPB bot template source code will already support a bot randomly wandering around in a level that has no waypoints.
