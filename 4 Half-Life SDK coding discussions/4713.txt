I want to know how to make cl_rate settings i choose(ex: 1000) to stay like default and not be modified every time i enter an game to 9999(game default).
So, i have to modify some dll to make my preffered cl_rate value default game value but i dont know which dll and how can i edit&compile him correctly.

If someone would be so nice to handle me an already modified dll with cl_rate 1000 it would be great.
If not at least some clueslike: which dll should i edit&stuff
thx
