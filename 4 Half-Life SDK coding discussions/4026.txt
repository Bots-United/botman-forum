Blame me for being an idiot but how do I add .cpp and .h files to the hl.dsw?

Edit: Adding these files so that the compiler recognises them and compiles it. I know right-click the folder, choose add files yadah, yadah. But that is not what I'm looking for.

The proper way to add or remove files from the project, is to open the .dsw (or .dsp) file, then click on the "Source Files" or "Header Files" folder (depending on whether you are adding .cpp files or .h files), then click on "Add Files to Folder...", then click on the files you want to add in the dialog box.

If you want to remove something, just click on the filename and press the "Delete" key.

To create a new file that doesn't exist yet, click on "File->New" in the Visual Studio main menu.

Using the Visual Studio interface to add or remove files will make sure that they get added or remove properly from all build configurations (Release, Debug, Profile, etc.).  You can add or remove them manually by opening the .dsp file in a text editor, but you HAVE to know what you are doing so that it gets added or remove from ALL projects.

Thanks. I would also like to know which files are actually compiled into a .dll file in the .dsp.

For example, when I add the hltv.cpp to the source folder in the hl.dsp, the compiler doesn't seem to notice it. So I would like to know if it is actually added in the .dsp.

Thanks in advance.

Any file that is in the project will be compiled into the .dll file.

You can verify this by looking in the Debug or Release folder for the .obj file that corresponds to the .cpp file.  If you delete the .obj file and build the .dll file (or .exe file), MSVC will build the .obj file again before creating the .dll file (or .exe file).
