each file in the project has "#included" files defined at the beginning. why does it matter what order they are in? example: i am trying to get the grunts to follow you if you used them but if i have it as:
#include      "defaultai.h"
#include      "scripted.h"
#include      "extdll.h"
#include      "plane.h"
#include      "util.h"
#include      "cbase.h"
#include      "monsters.h"
#include      "schedule.h"
#include      "animation.h"
#include      "squadmonster.h"
#include      "weapons.h"
#include      "talkmonster.h"
#include      "soundent.h"
#include      "effects.h"
#include      "customentity.h"

it gives me 2 compile errors, but if i put
"#include defaultai.h" in any other place in order ill end up with 59 errors. can anyone explain this to me? thanks

Some header files are dependant on others,
say you have a type called myType declared in mytype.h

In another header file you have a function that takes one argument of the myType type.

If you include the function header file first the compiler won't know what myType is and you will get an error.

Look at some of the other files for the proper include order.

Put extdll.h at the top and then cbase.h. you should put more general header files at the top like these that dont depend on anything that you are including below it.
