I am looking to build a program that can generate statistics off TFC demos.  I have downloaded the HL 2.2 SDK, but found almost nothing dealing with the format of .dem files.

Does anyone know where I could find a document detailing the syntax or the actual code used to write to demos?

Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks.

Chances are, its in the engine code.

The demo file data is essentialy captured network packets stored in a file.  The Half-Life network protocol is not documented anywhere.  It is also encrypted using Blowfish encryption.  Since the demo file data derives from the network packet data, it also is not documented anywhere.

Well if it is encrypted, there is no point in trying find the documentation.  I do not plan on sifting through HL using a hex editor to try and find the key.  

*Shakes fist at Bruce Schneier and his Blowfish algorithm*...actually I loved his Secrets and Lies book along with his well known Applied Cryptography.

Thanks for the useful info botman.  Much appreciated.  I will send you a nice X-mas basket or something :D
