Did you change any of the code related to picking up items (i.e. did you modify things so that only one team can pick up certain items)???

Search for "GiveNamedItem" (I think it's in multiplay_gamerules.cpp, but I don't remember exactly).  You'll see where players are given the "weapon_9mmhandgun" and "weapon_crowbar".

I haven't tried to compile SDK 2.2 with the MingW32 compiler, but since Valve made all of the HLDM weapons client side in SDK 2.2 the code is definitely much different.  The only features that Valve added was the voice communication support and HLTV.  Voice communications only requires 2 new functions in the engine\eiface.h file to control it.  HLTV doesn't require any MOD changes.  Therefore, you don't really need SDK 2.2 if you are using MingW32.  The only thing you need to change is engine\eiface.h and you will have support for voice communication.  (i.e. there's no need to upgrade to SDK 2.2 if you are using MingW32).
