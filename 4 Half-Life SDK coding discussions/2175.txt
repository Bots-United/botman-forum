It's not in the SDK.  Valve left it out.

Send an e-mail to Harry Teasley (het) at Valve (the e-mail addresses are on the "people" page at www.valvesoftware.com) to see if you can get the missing player peristence stuff from the SDK.

You might also want to e-mail David "Nighthawk" Flor (at opera.redeemedsoft.com/index.htmThe Opera web site) and get the player persistence files from him, since he's the only one that has done anything with them.

If you just want to build SDK 2.1 and don't need the player persistence files then see question #32 in the planethalflife.com/botman/MOD_FAQ.shtmlMOD FAQ
