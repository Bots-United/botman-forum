I was just wondering if its possible to edit the edict_s and entvars_s structures (most interested in altering the latter), for ex, removing the health field. I want to remove things like that that all entities dont share since it just wastes space (and my mod doesnt need some of them like teleport_time), but figured it might not work if I removed everything but what all entities have in common since the HL engine itself access the entvars_s structure in calls to trace_line and the like. Also, if anybody has successfully deleted/moved any fields in the entvars_s structure, would you please reply with which fields you have moved/deleted?

All of the entvars are held in progdefs.h

but If you remove any of the "fields" ion the structure then a lot of things won't work.

What are you trying to do with it?

Or you could always make up your own structure with what you need and grab the values from entvars_s or whatever.


If you're trying to save memory because you think that entvars_s variables take up a lot of memory (as there is a lot of things in it) It doesn't unless you make it a pointer (which you probably do anyway) If its a point then its just pointing to where an entvar_s structure is stored. I think you've already known that anyway! :p

You can not change any of the header files in the engine subdirectory.  The Half-Life engine was built using these same include files and these structures MUST remain this same size otherwise the engine will crash.

I figured as much (that you cant change them) but I figured maybe it was the kinda thing where the engine was compiled using only the absolute minimum fields (like origin and model index) and any fields after a certain point could be removed (since the engine only takes pointers to the struct).

I just wanted to clean it up some. I'm a programmer stuck in "MS-DOS Mode" and I cant stand to see ANY memory wasted. Its stupid to store the field of view for every object when only monsters and players need to store it. Same with gravity. Doors dont need gravity. The comment for friction says it applies only to entities with movetype set to MOVETYPE_BOUNCE. So why store it for everything?

Also, I was wondering if its possible to edit the information about each movetype, I think movetypes are handled by the MOD and not the engine, correct? I looked around and found some stuff in pm_shared.cpp but I'm not sure if thats what actually calculates movement or not (I was too tired to look around too much)


I want to strip the SDK down to its bare minimum(most likely leaving in entities like func_door, or maybe not. I could always code them myself using the sdk as a reference =-) and then start coding my mod, as I think that would be the easiest thing to do since I want to change a lot of things. I want to make the physics a little more realistic, fix a lot of things those "Undone" comments say, and then make my own mod on top of it =-)

Also, do you know of a tutorial on making a grappling hook for the hl engine? There used to be hundreds of them for quake 1 and 2 but I guess nobody in HL wanted a hook? I've got one somewhat working but I dont know how to get the client-side dll to compile, because it spawns a bolt when fired and links the bolt to the player when an entity-based beam, but the crossbow's bolt isnt defined in the client dll (removed using #ifdef) and when I add it things like UTIL_Spark and UTIL_BubbleTrail arent defined.

Basically you cannot edit any of the structures in header files that comes with Valve's HL SDK. If you do then I doubt it will work.

I've never heard of removing field from structures... I don't think you can do that. What you put in is what you get out.
