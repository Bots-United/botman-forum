ok i was thinking how could i increase the size of a half life map? then it hit me what if i shink the player?? is this possible well i know it would have something to do witht he view and kinda thinking like well maybe i could use some examples from the crouching code like when he crouches he gets smaller so maybe change the code that says he is this tall and make him much smaller and decreas the speed he moves kind like if a mouse were to cross a room naturaly it would beat an ant but if the ant move the same speed they would tie so we want the new small versoin to walk slower as to simulate being small. so can anyone here help my vigure what parts of certain codes i need to edit to

A. make the player smaller (not a modeling q)
B. make it so he moves slower 

thanks for reading i hope i get some response thanks ps.botman can you help me with my hud queation?

well i have got some response from the nice folks at half life rally on this he said he scaled down the hull size in hlcsg i never though of that i was trying to make the players eye in view.cpp lower than shrink the models. now i still have to shrink the models but hey its worth it if you can make the tini half life maps nuch bigger

say am i not liked here or somthin? i never get ant q's answered but other people do... 

oh well i have pretty much given up on the whole hud thing scince no respons but when i was looking i figured out a cool littel trick with hud prit

ok this is kinda a tutorial but try not to post it on hl programming or anything oh well here ya go say you want it so each time you pick up a gun or deploy it will pring UZI SMG in the middle of your screen the main fuction is called hu print
this

ClientPrint(m_pPlayer->pev, HUD_PRINTCENTER, "GUN NAME");

ok so lets start by making it so when you deploy the gun it says it name so go to the BOOL Cglock18::Deploy( ) function and add it to the very top right above 
// pev->body = 1;
      return DefaultDeploy( "models/v_glock18.mdl", "models/p_glock18.mdl", glock18_DRAW, "mp5" );

so it should look like this

{
ClientPrint(m_pPlayer->pev, HUD_PRINTCENTER, "GLOCK 18");
      // pev->body = 1;
      return DefaultDeploy( "models/v_glock18.mdl", "models/p_glock18.mdl", glock18_DRAW, "mp5" );

}

ok now go down to the reload function void Cglock18::Reload( void )

add this ClientPrint(m_pPlayer->pev, HUD_PRINTCENTER, "RELOADING....."); below             iResult = DefaultReload( 18, glock18_RELOAD, 1.5 ); so it should look like this

{
      int iResult;

      if (m_iClip == 0)
            iResult = DefaultReload( 17, glock18_RELOAD, 1.5 );
      else
            iResult = DefaultReload( 18, glock18_RELOAD, 1.5 );

ClientPrint(m_pPlayer->pev, HUD_PRINTCENTER, "RELOADING.....");

      if (iResult)
      {
            m_flTimeWeaponIdle = gpGlobals->time + RANDOM_FLOAT ( 10, 15 );
      }
}

and there ya go now when you deploy your gun it will say the name of it in the middle of the screen and when you reload it will say reloading... well now you cant say i just ask for stuff all the time (= once again all i ask is not to repost this tut no credit needed pssst hud question?
