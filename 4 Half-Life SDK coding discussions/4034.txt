Hello,


I am just interested in how the v.velocity works.

I am actually trying to do something like the slap command in AdminMOD, because i found this useful to pull troublesome players into line. (Or people who constantly camp)

I want to be able to use a console command, like this

slap playername damage


that slaps the player with that name and does that ammount of damage. Or, i would use the players "number". EG

vote 213

I hope anyone who reads this understands, and could give me an idea of how i could implement this..


Thanks in advance

The velocity is the current vector speed of an entity. For example, if you want to check how fast a player is moving, you can do:
code:

//edict_t *pPlayer;
float f_player_speed = pPlayer->v.velocity.Length();


I don't think it can be used to inflict damage to players, except maybe for fall damage. But since I don't know how AdminMod's slap command works, I might be mistaken.

thank PM,

Its ok, the Health part i could do, i just need a simple slap command, the syntax doesnt really matter. I'm not certain however to how the velocity can be changed,

any info on how the velocity can be changed would be helpful.. :)

IE: - + / * which directions they would make it go and how i should implement it 

Sorry if this is an annoying question...

The velocity is stored as a 3D vector. Each of the x, y, z components of this vector describe the amount of deviation relative to each of the map's axises.

For example, a velocity of (0, 0, 1) would make your player move right upwards by 1 unit. A velocity of (1, 1, 0) would make your player move diagonally by sqrt(2) units.

ah, ok...

(you can probably tell ive been refreshing IE like mad to get your reply :D

Could you tell me how to take an argument from the console that is the players name and use it to change that players velocity??

sort of like this

code:

else if (FStrEq(pcmd, "slap"))
{
    //arg1 will be the players name i want to slap
    //how could i write code to slap the player
    //whos name is arg1 ??
    //then i would change their velocity
}



Basically, i would do this in the console

slap JoeJoe

I want to find JoeJoe's edict and change his velocity, but im not sure how to get his edict and not everyone elses...

Think you could help me??


Thanks in advance

An example of mine, you have to modify it though. But you should understand what it does.
code:

         if (strcmp (pcmd, "botorder") == 0)
         {
            if ((arg1 != NULL) && (*arg1 != 0) && (arg2 != NULL) && (*arg2 != 0))
               for (int i = 0; i < MaxClientsOnServer (); i++)
                  if (strcmp (arg1, NetnameOf (bots[i].pEntity)) == 0)
                  {
                     ServerConsole_printf ("BOT %s executes command %s\n", NetnameOf (bots[i].pEntity), arg2);
                     FakeClientCommand (bots[i].pEntity, arg2);
                     break;
                  }
            return;
         }


Hint: for getting player entities instead, modify this using the INDEXENT() macro instead.

Use this I made for my bot :)

Input part of the name of the player as the parameter and you get out the edict.

code:

edict_t *UTIL_FindPlayerByTruncName ( const char *name )
{
      edict_t *pent = NULL;
      edict_t *best_edict = NULL;

      short int best_matched = 999;

      short int i;

      for( i = 1; i <= gpGlobals->maxClients; i ++ )
      {
            pent = INDEXENT(i);
            
            if( pent != NULL )
            {
                  if( pent->v.netname )
                  {
                        int length = strlen(name);                                     
                        
                        char arg_lwr[80];
                        char pent_lwr[80];
                        
                        strcpy(arg_lwr,name);
                        strcpy(pent_lwr,STRING(pent->v.netname));
                        
                        strlow(arg_lwr);
                        strlow(pent_lwr);
                        
                        if( strncmp( arg_lwr,pent_lwr,length) == 0 )
                        {
                              length = strlen(pent_lwr);

                              if ( length < best_matched )
                              {
                                    best_matched = length;
                                    best_edict = pent;
                              }                        
                        }
                  }
            }
      }

      return best_edict;
}
