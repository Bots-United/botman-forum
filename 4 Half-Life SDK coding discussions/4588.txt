i have made weapon changes and added new ones too, but i wanted to test if everything wrks. i followed the tutorial on how to compile your mp and client dlls, but cant find mp.dsw and client.dsw. instead i find mp and client.dsp, and when i try to open them, they just create .vcp files. can anybody help me with this problem?

.dsw stands for "Developer Studio Workspace". These files are created when you open a .dsp file (Developer Studio Project) by Visual Studio. You need Microsoft Visual Studio to open these files. But perhaps there is a new format for project files with the recently arrived Visual Studio .NET

I suppose it's not a problem, if you can still open the project file with the MSVC editor...

Im using vstudio.net and its basically the same thing as 6.0.  Just open the dsp or dsw files or whatever and build them... It'll build the dll files for you.  if you build it, they will come...
