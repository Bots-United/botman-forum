I was wondering about the .fgd files. Does the .fgd file determine what the game can load (monsters and etc.)? If not what file holds the code for the monsters? The .dll? 

What is the .fgd for? And can you simply cut&paste from other .fgd files into the one your gona use for map editing?


thanx....ALOT!

The .fgd file is used by worldcraft :
1) to allow you to put entities into your map and edit their values easily.
2) to let worldcraft know what entities you have available.

If you didn't have a .fgd, you'd probably be typing the entity names out manually, and referring to some reference guide for the entity variable names, etc.

So if I added entities to the .fgd file it wouldn't add them to the game?

P.S. thanx mongo

No, it would not.  If the entites don't already exist in the game DLL code (for example monsters in single player Half-Life using hl.dll), you would not be able to create them by simply adding an entity to a map.
