hello!

if i had a complete mod working under windows with all the sources, how would i compile a linux-dedicated-server for this mod? 
just upload the sources to my linux-shell and compile them? 
would i need some major code-changes?
how would i get the make-file for the linux compiler?

thx in advance

There is a makefile for Linux included with the SDK.

When you transfer all the source code to Linux make sure to FTP the files in ASCII mode (not binary mode) so that FTP will convert carriage return / linefeed to newline.  Or, run do2unix on the files once you get them to your Linux box (if not using FTP).

You will need the gcc compiler installed on your Linux box, and that should give you 'make' installed as well.

Modify the makefile to suit the names of the source code files you have in your MOD and run 'make' to build the shared library (.so file).

If you have any problems, just post the error messages you are getting here.

thx for the quick answer.

am i right that the server is just the "mp.dll" (windows) or the "cs_i386.so" (linux) file (example cs) and some ressources like maps etc?

how much of the sourcecode would i need? (because i want to compile a server for mod-project wich is not mine and i don't think that they will hand out more code to me than needed)

Yes, the only thing different between the Linux dedicated server and the Windows dedicated server is the DLL (or shared library) in the dlls directory of the MOD.  The maps are exactly the same.  The sounds are exactly the same.  The models are exactly the same.  Even the client.dll file is exactly the same (not actually run on the Linux server, but MUST be there to verify the player has exactly the same client.dll file as the server, hence no client cheating).

You will need ALL of the source code used to build the Windows dedicated server (the DLL file in the dlls folder) in order to build the Linux shared library.  If you aren't the one that created this MOD then you will not be able to create a Linux version of the MOD (since you won't have the source code).
