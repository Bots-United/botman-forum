ive created some new weapons that use the "firebullet" for the primary fire. but the problem is that when i fire no sound, weapon animation, or decal shows up. but if i shoot at a player and such they will still take damage. i looked at the code in other weapons using firebullet and no weapon animation is defined in it, so i figured it was defined elsewhere depending on the weapon type. but ive been searching for some time now and have been unable to find it, ive even looked through the client dll with no luck. if anyone could please help me with the firing problem id be very aprieciative. thanks
