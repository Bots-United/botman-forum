hello im trying to put this 



UTIL_ScreenFade( m_pPlayer, Vector(0,0,0), 2, 0.5, 128, FFADE_IN );
(also included #include "shake.h" )

into my sniper rifle the mp.dll compiles fine but when I compile the client.dll i keep on getting an error:

crossbow.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "void __cdecl UTIL_ScreenFade(class CBaseEntity *,class Vector const &,float,float,int,int)" (?UTIL_ScreenFade@@YAXPAVCBaseEntity@@ABVVector@@MMHH@Z)
C:\hl\cempta\cl_dll\client.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals

(also im new to this so take it easy on me)

LNK prefixed errors are link errors. It means it cannot link a certain statement to where it needs to be. This can mean:

a) You haven't included a libry to your project
(Project >> Add Existing File >> All Files)

b) You haven't included the correct header file. (Which doesn't seem likely)


Or, as it looks to me, you have made a new gun, but copied the code from crossbow.cpp. If this is the case, most of the functions that you would need have a body within crossbow.cpp. This isn't allowed, so you must delete any code that you have doubled up on.

(Functions, or variables in the same procedure)

Hope this helps in any way
