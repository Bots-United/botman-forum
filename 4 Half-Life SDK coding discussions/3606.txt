well this really doesnt have to do much with coding, well it kinda does. :P  i couldnt find anyone on this anywhere so i decided, i should ask BOTMAN! he is a smart guy, maybe he will know. :) anyway here goes..

well im making a mod, and im trying to make a new HUD which tells how many hit points and/or armor points you have left.. similar to mods such as counter-strike, firearms, and dod.. i was going to do this with sprites, but sprites use indexed color thus making it imposable to have your text (such as how many hit points are left) somewhat transparent (say 60% opacity) while also having the same text's background transparent.. how would i go about doing this.. thanks.

You would need to make a sprite using sprgen with the SDK and give it ten frames I think (By editing the .qc file) The ten frames should have your numbers 0 to 9 I think :) Oh your BMPs should be 256 colours and have a the last colour (or is the the first colour?) in the pallete to be the background.

When you draw the sprite ingame you'd code it in the client.dll

See botmans RADAR tutorial, he uses sprites for his radar and the code to draw them is in there, pretty easy to find out :) (Well if you have a decent IQ ;))

It's not clear whether you are trying to draw transparent (alpha) sprites or are trying to draw sprites that are not transparent (i.e. black background).

You can do the transparency just using the alpha channel.  Most sprites are draw with a alpha transparency (which you can adjust anywhere from 0=totally transparent to 255=not at all transparent).

If you are trying to draw a black background, you should use a mask for the image you are trying to draw.  Look on some image editing websites (like tutorials for Photoshop or Paintshop) to understand better what a mask is.  It's basicaly an outline of the image you want that's all black.  You draw the solid black sprite first (not using alpha channel), then draw the image you want to display.  The black will wipe out anything that would normally be behind the image so that you image will stand out better against whatever it is drawn on.
