Lo there.

I was wondering if someone knows how Counter-strike nows what weapon is inside a weaponbox. Weaponbox being the entity that has the model that you can see on the ground. The weaponbox isn't the actual weapon entity itself which you will hold when you run over the weaponbox to pick it up. The weaponbox will get removed from engine as I understand when you do this, but the "containing" weapon ent will go to your hands. You can look at the weapon entity's owner to see that it's a weaponbox as it has a high entity number. Ie weaponbox has ent. number 105, the real weapon ent has ent number 103 and looking at 103's owner, it will say 105 as long as no one picks it up.
But I can't find a way to "extract" the weapon ent from the weaponbox on the floor. I've looked through all of the members in the entvars struct and haven't found anything linking a weaponbox to a specific weapon ent... how do they do it?

I thought about making code to manually pick that weapon ent up, so I would kill the weaponbox, which is the easy part, but then I need to find the weapon ent number, and equip a player with that.

A workaround would be to search all entities for the right classname (f.e. weapon_m4a1 for a colt), and try to match its owner against the weaponbox ent number, kill the weaponbox, and equip the player with this weapon ent. But I guess it's too much work :-\

If I understand right, you want to force a player to remotely "pick up" a weaponbox, right ?

Just call DispatchTouch() on it with the entity of the player you want to equip with...

As for knowing which weapon is "inside" the weaponbox, I guess the model of the weaponbox says it all... Else have you tried looking at the entity's infobuffer ?

Well yes, but no, not really. I just want to be able to make a user pick up more weapons in CS. I'm able to detect the touching of entities, where a player who already has a primary weapon, walks over a weaponbox containing a primary weapon. I could easily kill the weaponbox, and give the user a NEW weapon of the same TYPE as what the model of the weaponbox told me, but it wouldn't be the same weapon, which isn't really right. Besides, the old weapon would still be there if I didn't delete it (which could be done by that workaround I wrote of).

Besides that, I'm not sure I know what an entity's infobuffer is, or how to retrieve it and check its value. :-\

An infobuffer is typically a character string attached to an entity, that holds "extraordinary" data under the form of key/value pairs. There are functions to read and set an entity's infobuffer, but you're left to parse the string and read from it.
