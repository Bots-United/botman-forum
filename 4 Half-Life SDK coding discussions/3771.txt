Yes, it's been out for about a month.

You might want to subscribe to some of Valve's e-mail lists (like hlcoders) and you'll get notified the day that it's released...

I'm not going to provide a list of patches for SDK 2.3 using Borland or MinGW.

The SDK 2.3 right out of the box probably won't compile cleanly with Borland or MinGW (I haven't downloaded 2.3 so I can't tell you for sure, but it's a pretty safe bet).

If you want to know what has changed in the SDKs, you will need to download SDK 2.2 and SDK 2.3, install them both in a separate directory, then use a diff tool (like BeyondCompare from www.scootersoftware.com) to compare the source code files between the UNMODIFIED SDK 2.2 and SDK 2.3.  Once you have a list of what source code was changed, you can cut-and-paste that from the SDK 2.3 source code directly into the patched SDK 2.2 source code and try compiling it (you will effectively have a patched SDK 2.3 source code).  You will undoubtably get some compiler errors with the newly pasted source code.  Just clean up these errors and you should be good to go.

If you aren't trying to make a MOD for public release, it probably isn't worth trying to upgrade to SDK 2.3.  If you ARE planning on making a MOD for public release, then you should go ahead and purchase MSVC from some place like ebay.com where you can get it for around $50 US.

Thanx Botman,
I have MSVC, but it won't work.
I posted that with info in the C problems board, but no-ones responded :(

Maybe you need to try uninstalling and reinstalling MSVC.

If that doesn't fix it, reformat your hard disk, reinstall Windows, install MSVC and try again.

I've never heard of anyone with a clean install of Windows and a clean install of a good copy of MSVC ever having problems building the default (unmodified) SDK.
