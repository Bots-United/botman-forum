I know this may not exactly be the type of question you guys are looking for to answer but I have a rather simple question to ask.  How do you guys digest the SDK to the point of understanding it?  I have looked long and hard at this thing for the longest time, an I am having trouble understanding how things are linked together and how certain things work.  What did you do to understand everything?  Does it come from experience with C++ or from hours of trial and error?  I am just developing my C++ skills, but I find it very hard to understand.  What can I do to get over this?

Having a strong C++ background helps a lot.  Valve uses inheritance fairly heavily in the SDK.  Understanding how classes inherit functions and variables from other classes helps to understand how something works.

If you spend more time becoming familiar with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) you will begin to understand the SDK much more easily.

You can cut-and-paste stuff from SDK coding tutorials all day long, but if you don't understand WHAT you are doing and WHY you are doing it you really aren't learning anything (i.e. you can't take the knowledge you gained from a tutorial and quickly apply that information to some else that's similar but different).

I would guess that it would take a person who's fairly strong in C++ at least 3 or 4 months to get a pretty good grip on how most of the stuff in the Valve SDK really works.  I've been working with it for 2 years and there's still stuff that I don't understand (the monster AI for one), mostly due to not having enough time to grind through the code to figure out how things work.
