Just a quick thing, i cant figure out how to print a message to the HUD, using hudtextparms_t but writing it to all clients. I also wish for it to accept all arguments to the printmsg command :S

Iv'e tried, but failed, here is something ive tried.



        else if (FStrEq(pcmd, "printmsg"))
        {

            //Declaration of string to be printed
            char message[100];

              hudtextparms_t message_params;
                                     message_params.x = -1;
                  message_params.y = 0.4;
                  message_params.effect = 3;
                  message_params.r1 = 0;
                  message_params.g1 = 255;
                  message_params.b1 = 0;
                  message_params.a1 = 1;
                  message_params.r2 = RANDOM_LONG(0,255);
                  message_params.g2 = RANDOM_LONG(0,255);
                  message_params.b2 = RANDOM_LONG(0,255);
                  message_params.a2 = 1;
                  message_params.fadeinTime = 1.0;
                  message_params.fadeoutTime = 1.0;
                  message_params.holdTime = 10;
                  message_params.fxTime = 20;
                  message_params.channel = 1;
                  
                                    strcpy( message, arg1 );
                                    strcat( message, arg2 );
                  
                  strcat( message, arg3 );
                                    strcat( message, arg4 );
                                    UTIL_HudMessage( pPlayer, message_params, message );              

                  return;
        }


And, could someone please explain how Half-Life reads the WRITE_BYTE() and WRITE_SHORT(), because I do not fully understand it

Thanks in advance

MessageBegin(), WriteByte(), WriteShort(), and all the rest of the WriteStuff() until MessageEnd() are meant to tell the engine (either the server engine or any local client engine) to build a network packet to send to the server (or back to a client), containing the specified data.

Once the network subsystem layer of the engine receives a MessageBegin(), it is somewhat "triggered" into a "message reception state", and should only be (and is) taken out when MessageEnd() is received (unless for MSG_ONE_UNRELIABLE type packets the engine is allowed to discard). Meanwhile, the engine catches every WriteStuff() it receives and build the packet inside a buffer. When MessageEnd() is received, this buffer is validated, its content is interpreted and the resulting action can be taken (display stuff, update entity position or whatever).

That's why in your code, you mustn't do anything special with the engine or the game DLL that would cause either of them to send a new packet while a packet is being received. One common example is when botman intercepts bot message in the bot_client.cpp file of his HPB_bot. Functions in this file are called everytime a WriteSomething() is called so that they build the message content back. If in any of these functions, for whatever reason, you'd like to print a message on the screen, let's say "debug mode: caught packet NNN", the function call you will be issuing by the engine side MUST NOT make it send a packet (and it will, if you intend to display this text on the HUD). If you do that, the game will crash with a "MSG_something: New message started when MESSAGE_END not sent yet" error message.

Great care has to be taken, when catching messages, to do strict minimal stuff in between. In your case, it shouldn't be a problem, since UTIL_HudMessage() drops all its stuff at once on the network. If ever you get trouble with this function, here's mine you can alter that does basically the same thing:
code:

         // send the welcome message to this client
         // do not use the engine macros here (such as MESSAGE_BEGIN, WRITE_BYTE etc.) since we
         // have to hook these messages too as if they were coming from outside the bot DLL...
         pfnMessageBegin (MSG_ONE_UNRELIABLE, SVC_TEMPENTITY, NULL, pClient);
         pfnWriteByte (TE_TEXTMESSAGE);
         pfnWriteByte (1); // channel
         pfnWriteShort (-8192); // x coordinates * 8192
         pfnWriteShort (-8192); // y coordinates * 8192
         pfnWriteByte (0); // effect (fade in/out)
         pfnWriteByte (255); // initial RED
         pfnWriteByte (255); // initial GREEN
         pfnWriteByte (255); // initial BLUE
         pfnWriteByte (1); // initial ALPHA
         pfnWriteByte (255); // effect RED
         pfnWriteByte (255); // effect GREEN
         pfnWriteByte (255); // effect BLUE
         pfnWriteByte (1); // effect ALPHA
         pfnWriteShort (256); // fade-in time in seconds * 256
         pfnWriteShort (512); // fade-out time in seconds * 256
         pfnWriteShort (256); // hold time in seconds * 256
         pfnWriteString (RACC_WELCOMETEXT); // send welcome message
         pfnMessageEnd (); // end

Thanks once again Pierre, but a few things just quickly


I'm using Visual Studio.NET so I cant copy and paste the errors (that I know of :S).

pClient isn't declared, although I think it should be entvars_t

pfnWriteByte and all the rest of the pfn don't work :S


What should I declare these as?


Thanks in advance

Ok, I have fixed everything but pClient.

I do not wish to try declaring this as i dont want to do something wrong :S.

g_engfuncs is where pfnWriteByte WriteShort etc are :)

What should I declare pClient as?

Thanks in advance

Of course, what I posted needs some tweaking.

Right, pfnMessageBegin() and the others come from the g_engfuncs enginefuncs_t structure. Commonly used macros you can use as shortcuts are MESSAGE_BEGIN(), WRITE_BYTE(), and so on.

Then if you look at the pfnMessageBegin prototype, you will figure out that pClient is a player entity, i.e an edict_t pointer. Just replace my pClient with your pPlayer and you should be done with it.
