i'm attempting to convert my 2.1 based code to 2.3 so i used BEyondCompare to marvelous effect on mose of the interesting files. but as far as i can tell there are gaping holse in the code. after searching over and over through the source-only release i find these porblems:

some maths libs headers are rearranged and not included porperly

nowhere in the code are some essential new header files included (like hltv.h!) meaning it appears ti be impossible to compile!

some HLTV code uses Overview_ engfuncs that dont even exist!

someone explain this to me?! either:

1. my distribution is a fucked one (from valve-erc)

2. i copied things over other thigns and buggered it up while trying to be clever in beyondcompare

3. it's shit

!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

There are some .cpp files (and .h files?) included that aren't used in the build of the DLLs.  These are examples or unfinished works that Valve didn't bother to exclude.

Don't assume that all of the .cpp files in the SDK are supposed to compile.  Use the list of files in the .dsp file to determine which .cpp files are meant to be part of the DLL and which are not.

ok, going over it again ith Beyond Compare and it's starting to make more sense, i'm copying over the spectator code mainly but it integrates somewhat with the HLTV stuff, which is still looking a bit scary! the main thing i havent figured out entirely yet is the voicemanager which is my main priority. i'll let you know how it compiles and if it runs at all tonight!
