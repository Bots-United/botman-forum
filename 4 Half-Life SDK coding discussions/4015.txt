What's the difference between gpGlobals->Time and UTIL->WeaponTimeBase or something like that?

These two are giving me problems with my mod by screwing up the animations and making the gun unusable for the first minute of a new map in Single-player.

I'm using SDK 2.3.

All I know is that gpGlobals->time holds the amount of time passed in seconds from the beginning of the map.

UTIL_WeaponTimeBase has something to do with the time of the next attack or something

UTIL_WeaponTimeBase() is used to handle time on the client.  Using gpGlobals->time on the client won't work.  When Valve extracted out the player physics stuff from the engine into the client code, the created the UTIL_WeaponTimeBase() function that will work on both the server and the client.  Since some of the code is shared between the server and the client, you need to have a way to allow both of them to have a common function that references the current time.

If you are doing a MOD with a server and client DLL, you need to use UTIL_WeaponTimeBase().  If you are just doing a server side MOD, just stick to using gpGlobals->time.

So that's what both of these do. Thanks Botman, I have a clearer picture now.

i reccomend you hunt around the code for "usedecrement" or something to that effect. what it enables you to do is use the length of time as a count down. so if your reload anim is 2 seconds long you set the timer to 2 seconds and in 2 seconds time it is reduced to zero, regardles of the actual time of the map, very handy and less brain ache involved.
