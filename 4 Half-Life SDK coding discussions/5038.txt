hi ppl,
i dunno if this is the rite place for askin this question but here goes ...
i am trying to write a half life BSP renderer i am a complete noob and this is my very first attempt at anything like this so i am just begining to understand the BSP .... i have done most of the basic stuff .... a huge thanx to botman for his BSP tools that helped me alot in this process ....
the problem that i am facing rite now is water .... how do i detect and properly render animating water .... all that i know rite now is that in some maps water is represented by func_water ..... 
also i need to know how to detect if the player is in the water or not ..... so that the rendering can be modified accordingly ....
plz help me i have been stuck with this for quite some time now ....
thanx in advance,
enygmyx.

Download the Quake I source code (use www.google.com to search for "q1source.zip" to find download sites) and take a look at the source code that Quake used for rendering water effects.

i have both the quake1 and quake2 source code (can't understand a thing for now though) with me ... i wanted to know if rendering etc of water in half life is more similar to quake1 or quake2 ? .... 
another thing that wud be gr8 is if u cud point me where to look in the huge amount of code for  water related stuff....
also if someone cud explain the prefixes that Id use for every file and function(e.g. there will be multiple files with same name except fr the prefix like cl_ents and sv_ents etc similarly with functions) that wud make things a lot easier...
thanks in advance,
enygmyx.

I don't know much about the Quake source code, although I suspect Half-Life is much closer to QuakeII than Quake ; anyway for the prefixes:
-the cl_ prefix is for the files that make part of the client part of the game only.
-the sv_ prefix is for the files that make part of the server part of the game only.

See this about QuakeI vs. QuakeII...

http://collective.valve-erc.com/index.php?go=q1_or_q2

...it's mostly QuakeI with colored lighting, decals, skeletal animation and C++ instead of QuakeC.  The rendering system, lightmaps and BSP format are almost identical to QuakeI.

Search the QuakeI source code for "R_DrawWaterSurfaces" to find the function that draws water.  Also search for "EmitWaterPolys".  In fact, just search ALL the .h and .c files for "water" and you should quickly find everything you are looking for.
