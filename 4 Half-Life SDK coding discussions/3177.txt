Can't you just edit the splash.bmp and the changes should be noticeable on the title screen?
Well, I added some text to my splash.bmp but when I load up CS its all garbled up looking. The whole screen except for the options is messed up. Why didn't it work?

Make sure you saved the file with the exact same format as the original. That is, 640x480 bitmap, same bit depth, same palette, no compression.
