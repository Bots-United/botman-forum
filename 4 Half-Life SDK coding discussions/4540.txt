BUCKET FIX W000t!

Ok all here is the scoop. Open up your client side work space and look for this in ammo.cpp or ammohistory.cpp I forget but its at the bottom just comment out as seen below laters Airsoftasa.


                           if ( p && fastSwitch ) // check for fast weapon switch mode
            {
                  // if fast weapon switch is on, then weapons can be selected in a single keypress
                  // but only if there is only one item in the bucket
                  WEAPON *p2 = GetNextActivePos( p->iSlot, p->iSlotPos );
                  //if ( !p2 )
                  //{      // only one active item in bucket, so change directly to weapon
                        //ServerCmd( p->szName );
                        //g_weaponselect = p->iId;
                        //return;
                  //}

whats wrong with setting hud_fastswitch to 0? You might as well give players the choice.

I wouldn't call that a "fix" as such.

Velocities above 2000 cause problems with the default physics/collision code.

If you need it to go that fast, just make it an instant hit weapon (like the 9mm, MP5, shotgun, etc.).

well the bucket fix is for borland users doing novgui i believe i have a prob with no hud pic apearing so i just altered that code now it apears each time i select a weapon. Man the crossbow bolt thing sux i need for the bolt to go faster as to simulate an airsoft bb going faster with an upgrade oh well ait ty all laterz.

That behaviour is by design, set hud_fastswitch to 0 with unmodified code and it will work as you want it to, the game automatially gets out the weapon if its the only weapon the player has in that bucket.
