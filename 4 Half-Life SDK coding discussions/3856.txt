im making a single player mod that sort of side scrolls. i need help to stop the player rotating but still allowing him to aim his weapon up and down. ive looked in in_camera.cpp and a quick look in view.cpp but to no avail :(  any ideas?

the rotating of a player is the y axis, all you need to do is keep the Y angles of a player constant. The X axis is the look up / down angles.

If you need a little help with the camera, have a look here

Probably this is engine internals. I never found a way for the engine not to take in account a user's input.

Force pPlayerEdict->v.v_angle.y = 0 at the end of each frame.

cl_dll/input.cpp
cl_dll/input32.cpp

in there you'll find the client's munging of keyboard/mouse and joystick input, if you want to reign supreme over the player's turning ability try taking control of the bits that say::


gEngfuncs.SetViewAngles( (float *)cmd->viewangles );

(or something similar)
you could make you're own vec3_t to store the angles you want in... the y rotation is the players yaw and you can usually just do:

anyvector[YAW] = 0.0;

to make it 0!
