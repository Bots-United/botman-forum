I made a code for new weapon and it works correctly, but I can not select it in the HUD, when I take another weapon. What is the problem?
And also I can't set the crosshair for new weapon. Can somebody help me?

if you want the new weapon to show in the HUD that is on client side.

anther thing you could do is make them start with the weapon.
