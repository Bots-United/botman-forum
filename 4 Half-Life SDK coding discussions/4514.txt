ok i would like it when you join a class it will do the command with out the client knowing

code:

else if ( FStrEq( pcmd, "soldier" ))
{
/////////////////////////////
command here? how<<<<<<------
////////////////////////////
pPlayer->pev->deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNABLE;
pPlayer->Spawn();
pPlayer->GiveNamedItem( "weapon_crossbow" );
pPlayer->GiveAmmo( AMMO_CROSSBOWCLIP_GIVE, "bolts", BOLT_MAX_CARRY );
pPlayer->GiveNamedItem( "weapon_9mmhandgun" );

g_engfuncs.pfnSetClientKeyValue( pPlayer->entindex(), g_engfuncs.pfnGetInfoKeyBuffer( pPlayer->edict() ), "model", "hgrunt" );
pPlayer->pev->armorvalue=20;
g_engfuncs.pfnSetClientMaxspeed( ENT( pPlayer->pev ), 700);
ClientPrint(pPlayer->pev, HUD_PRINTTALK, "You are now a scared soldier.");
pPlayer->Spawn();
}

WHAT command do you want?

Just use the SERVER_COMMAND() macro to execute a command on the server or use CLIENT_COMMAND() to execute a command on the client.

or use CLIENT_COMMAND() to execute a command on the client.



...unless it's a bot.

You can't issue time-based commands (such as +forward and -forward; +back; +hook) through an arbitrary ClientCommand. These commands have to be passed through the player entity's v.button bitmap.

Set the pev->buttons field to IN_DUCK to make them duck.

You'll have to keep setting this EVERY frame to make sure they keep ducking (for as long as you want them to).  If you just set it once, it will get cleared out again on the next frame.

StartFrame() is probably the best place to put this.

id recommend doing it on the clientside, should not be difficult to accomplish
