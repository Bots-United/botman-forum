but HERE!

When it say: click on "File" then "Open Workspace" and browse to the directory where you installed the SDK. Browse to the "dlls" folder and select the mp.dsw workspace file.

Exactly Here, select the mp.dsw.

That should have said "mp.dsp", not "mp.dsw".

There will be an "mp.dsp" file for the Standard SDK.

There will be an "hl.dsp" file for the Full SDK.

Open which ever one of those you find in your SDK 'dlls' folder.

When you open the .dsp file, Visual Studio will create the .dsw (workspace) file.  From then on you can just click on the .dsw (workspace) file to open your project.
