hello :)
k,here's a question: i've been playing around with
botman's netprobe a bit. i've been trying to make
it able to connect to another server without
leaving hl. example: the player says "netprobe:
connect x.x.x.x:port" in hl, netprobe catches that
packet, doesn't pass it to the server but connects
to another server instead. i dumped tons of client
-server traffic but i can't figure out how that
packet is supposed to look like.

any help appreciated :)

The packets on Internet servers are encrypted.  The engine used to send LAN network traffic unencrypted, but according to someone on the alt.games.half-life.editing newsgroup they aren't sent RAW with the current 1.1.0.7 Half-Life engine.  When I was able to view the raw LAN packets I noticed that there is a sequence number in the packets (when you connect to a server they start at 1 and go up from there, each packet to the server gets the next number).

You will not be able to simply stop sending packets to one server and start sending packets to a different server because there is some setup/caching stuff that take place when a player connect to a server.  Things like custom sounds, player decals and other entities are downloaded from the new server and precached on the client side.  If you disconnect from one server and connect to another server you will have to go through this setup phase with the new server.

Trying to do this through NetProbe isn't really necessary anyway.  In the console you can type "disconnect" to disconnect from the current server, then "connent IP" to connect to another server at the specific IP address.  Then engine will then go through all the setup stuff necessary and you will be connected to the new server.

Thanks a lot for your reply :)

I know that the packets are encrypted, just thought there's some description of the protocol somewhere, oh well...

And the precaching etc wouldn't be a problem, i can Alt-Tab to NetProbe, set a different ip to another server and disconnect/reconnect HL to localhost. I just wanted to bypass the Alt-Tab part somehow ;) Would be nice to have a proxy for HL like quizmo for qw.

Anyway, thanks a lot.
