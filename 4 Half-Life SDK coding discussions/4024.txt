bah, been working out some "auto entity reset" code that resets entities during an intermission to how they started the map. now i already know that WC / VHE wont work with spawnflags greater than 2048. so i made 2048 my "reset" flag, global to all entities. next in the DispatchSpawn function i checked for this flag so i could create a linked list of my ents that wanted to be reset. and? those entities would be "inhibited" .. .ARGH! turns out after about 3 hours of head scratching that it was spawnflag 2048 ITSELF that was causing the problem, and now it works fine using flag 1024!!!!!!

like how about hull sizes being hard coded in the engine code so u cant make small players :P

Actually, the hull sizes aren't hard coded into the engine...

well i knew about the hulls text, but does it allow me to use 2 different hull sizes for teams?

They did it in NS im sure..

also - how do you get ur maps to compile with the new hull sizes?

I've looked in NS dir and there is a nshulls.txt file... I'll have a scan thru the MP code for hulls.txt....

There a 4 hulls available (although one is the "point" hull which really can't be changed, leaving you with 3).

You can assign one hull size to one team and another hull size to another team, leaving you one left for other stuff.

You can't do something like have a "standing" hull for one team, a "ducking" hull for that team, a different "standing" hull for the second team and a different "ducking" hull for the second team.  This is 4 hulls and you don't have that many to work with (unless you make both of the ducking hulls one and the same).

When you compile the maps, you specify the "-hull" as a command line parameter to the compile tools (see that tutorial I linked to).  If you change the hull sizes, you HAVE to recompile all the maps that use those hull sizes.

He can maybe figure a trick, though, like for example, decide that the ducking hull of the tallest players will be the same as the normal hull of the smallest players...

This might work, with sufficient acrobacy in the dll code...

Nah I got it, thanks a lot, I modded the hulls text to include 3 hulls and recompiled my maps. I only need 3 hulls (one for one team and two for the other)

thx :D

UMMM well have you guys ever seen half life rally??? that should answer your hull size q. just get the tdk track developing kit there are some neat tricks they used in making the players smaller so the maps got bigger cool stuff check it out.
