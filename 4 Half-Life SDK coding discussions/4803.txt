something like..
code:

int i; 

edict_t *pEntity = NULL;
int iFlags;

// start from the list of entities after the clients. 
for ( i = 1; i <= gpGlobals->maxEntities; i ++ ) 
{ 
   pEntity = INDEXENT(i); 
   if ( ( pEntity == NULL ) <<OR>> FNullEnt(pEntity) )
     continue;
   iFlags = pEntity->v.flags;
   if ( iFlags & FL_MONSTER ) // is monster
   {
        // do stuff if monster
   }
   else if ( iFlags & FL_CLIENT ) // is player
   {
        // do stuff client
   }
}

i guess if the entity is already dead or null it is skipping.

it skips entities that aren't used... rarely all entities are used by HL unless you want the laggiest experience...

Just FNullEnt() alone is enough, as the NULL pointer check is the first check FNullEnt() does.
