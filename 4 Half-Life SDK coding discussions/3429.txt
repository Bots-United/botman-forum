I want to make a player control a monster by facing it and using a command. Currently I have made the code to set up the player spectate position on control the monsters angles. The trouble is to get the monster to use certain animations and attack/jump. I can get the monster to move but doesn't look very good if the monster doesnt actaully look as though its walking...

I need to ask how I might be able to use animations or access the CBaseMonster class properly within botman's template. I'm again wondering how botman managed to get CBaseEntity stuff working with the template becuase I seem to get some functions working (e.g. Killed funtion)

If anyone can help me here :p

Weren't your previous RCbots already able to control the monsters using the transforms ? Maybe you should ask specifically the Rocket Crowbar authors to see how they get a player to control a monster. Personally I tried to access some CBaseStuff inside Botman's template a few time ago but I had to include a lot of stuff and I couldn't manage to get it to do what I wanted. I gave up. Wish you better luck than me :)

The author did it by making their own transform code, i.e their own monsters. :/ Makes it difficult to just take control of any monster for me tho :( I wanna do this so I can "transform" into anything rather than just some of the monsters. I just want the monster to do the basic things like that already come with the monster (default attacks etc, but controlled by the player) I've asked the author and waiting a reply though :P

I think the problem is that we only have the CBaseEntity pointer in the template code. The derived classes can be different from mod to mod, so we have to no real chance to call certain functions unless we get the sources. We already had this problem some time ago with the doors/elevators ...
