hi all
i am trying to record the time at which a bot dies. for this purpose i have added some code to void CBaseMonster :: MonsterInitDead( void ) function, but i am not able to record anything. i also tried to record the bot's death in void CBaseMonster :: Killed( entvars_t *pevAttacker, int iGib ) function but no luck. please let me know if these places are correct for recording bot's death.

thanks in advance

i placed the code in int CBaseMonster :: TakeDamage( entvars_t *pevInflictor, entvars_t *pevAttacker, float flDamage, int bitsDamageType ) function and it seems to work.

thanks for your time.
