hi i'm making a simple deathmatch mod
with metroid/samus style.
ok i'd imagine this would be tought to do.
but how could i start by coding the same
rolling phys seen in metroid prime
for game cube.
i'll elaborate. the ball can be controled
with the arrow keys and really rolls.
now i'm not looking for weight in one part
of the ball just a simple way to do the rolling.
and i have no clue where to start.
if any one has any sugguestions like 'DON'T BOTHER". i'd love to hear some feed back.
thanx

The pm_shared directory of the SDK contains all of the physics code.

When you press on the forward, back, left or right key, this pm_shared code will modify your player's velocity based on the direction you are moving.

PM_PlayerMove() in pm_shared.c is the best place to start looking at the player movement code.

so where could i find some sort of yaw or axis
part? or would i have to add that in?

Are you trying to make a 3D game or a side scroller?

If you are trying to make a side scroller, then all of your maps will only have an X and Z direction (where Y would be a very thin area just wide enough for a player) or a Y and Z direction (where X would be just wide enough for a player).

Assuming you're trying to do a 2D side scroller and you go with the X and Z approach, you would just need to keep the playing facing the +X or -X direction (when they turn, they turn 180 degrees).

All of this can be found in the pm_shared physics code.  If you're not willing to look for things on your own and try to understand things on your own, there's not much more I can do for you.

If you have specific questions about what a specific pm_physics function does, you can post that question and maybe someone can help you, but just saying "What do I need to change to do XYZ" probably won't get you much of a response.

I think hes talking about in the stle of metroid prime. When you morph, it throws you into 3rd person with the morph ball. Then you can move it around on the ground.
