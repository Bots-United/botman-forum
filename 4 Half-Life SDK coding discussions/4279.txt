Yooo. I've been trying to figure out where Will Day's trace_plugin logs to for the last hour.... lol ::sigh::

Any ideas?

"Yooo". They are standard engine logs, that go in the .log files in your logs/ subdirectory - provided the according log parameters are enabled.

YOOO! Hmm, strange... I wasn't getting anything but the normal logs in there. I had:

log on
mp_logmessages 1
mp_logfile 1
mp_logdetail 4

Aha, figured out the problem. I was trying to trace ClientCommand, but it looks like the trace_plugin only logs every 1 second. I had to turn on unlimited logging to be able to get any output.
