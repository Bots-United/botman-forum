Am I losing out on anything major by using one of the free C++ compilers (mingw32) instead of MS Visual C++?

I apologize for the stupid newbie discussion, but none to worry, they will not last long :)

Did a bit more reading, and found out that you cannot compile the client DLL without MSV :(

Ah well. How large a chunk would that take out of my wallet?

I think that depends on whether you buy it directly from Microsoft or get a copy off of e-bay.com.

Say direct from microsoft, paying retail. I take it that would be a serious chunk of change.

You can get the Professional Edition of Visual Studio for only $1,079 US.  You can get the Enterprise Edition for only $1,619 US.  See the following web page for the details...

Suffice to say: eep

Is there any other way to get that client dll compiled then? Or is it totally dependent on MSV?

So far nobody has come up with a way of building the client DLL without using Microsoft Visual C++.

Well, crap. No biggie though, I took a look on ebay and a few are willing to part with their copies of MSV for pretty cheap :)

Hi,

my friend told me that he has Visual Studio and that he will let me have it for a mere 16mb Vid. card! Yes a lot of money value for a 16mb vid card! But one question, I think he has a imported version (something like that). Language is american but it is imported. Will it work for my Win2k? 


P.S. I can't WAIT to get it!!! Visual Basic, C++, Foxpro, Java, argh!
