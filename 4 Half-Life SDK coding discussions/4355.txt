When a client updates a CVar, like name or model, how does it get passed to the server so all the other clients are updated? In the case of the model, a player changes model type, the information is passed to server and if I have that model, it will display.

thanks in advance

There are several types of CVAR. Some of them only deal with the server, some of them are valid both on the server and the client, some of them are client-side only, and some of them can be set on the server while superceding those of the clients.

Only a naming convention can allow you to distinguish some of them. For example, most of the client side CVARs begin with "cl_". But it all depends on the programmer as he's totally free to choose whatever name he wants for his CVAR.

The "rules" that can be applied on a CVAR are defined when you declare your CVAR.
code:

cvar_t mycvar = {"mycvar", "1", FCVAR_EXTDLL};


defines a CVAR that is set by an external DLL (such as a metamod plugin). You can change FCVAR_EXTDLL to one of the many CVAR types that exist. Some will hide your CVAR (for password-like functionality), some will prevent your CVAR from being seen by the clients, some will prevent your clients from setting it, etc.

Look where cvar_t is defined.

For things like "model" and "name", the client will pass this information to the engine.  The engine will call ClientUserInfoChanged() with the edict of the client who changed something.

You can get the infobuffer to see what fields were changed.  Counter-Strike, for example, checks the "model" field to see if the player has switched to a model that they aren't allowed to use for that team.  If so, it switches the model back on them to what it used to be.
