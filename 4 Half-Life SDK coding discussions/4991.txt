we used single-player Half-Life source code to develop a multi-player LAN game. I am able to record different events caused by the players, but not able to differentiate them. All the players have classname "player" and donot have any targetname. how can we differentiate between the players? Can we use IP address of the machine for this purpose? if so where should I change?

thanks

This isn't a "Problem with botman's bots" question.  I'm moving it to "Half-Life SDK coding questions" where it belongs.

Use netname, not classname.

thanks Pierre-Marie Baty. netname is blank for player and "(null)" for other entities. for netname to contain valid string do we have to make any changes in the code?

thanks

code:
char player_name[32];

strcpy(player_name, STRING(pev->netname));


Did you forget the STRING() macro?
