Hi.

I've got the SDK 2.3 and compiled it, but there appear to be a couple of problems which I can't sort out.

One is that when a player is killed, if they move their view while on the ground (ie before going in to deathcam) the corpse on the ground moves accordingly.

The other is that when swinging the crowbar at a corpse (and, I assume, a live player) once a hit is scored it swings again about a tenth of a second later with obvious, messy, consequences.

Any ideas on how to fix either of these would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Andrew.

That happen on the original HL (the auto-crowbar sometimes, the rotating corpse always)... not only on SDK 2.2 and 2.3.
