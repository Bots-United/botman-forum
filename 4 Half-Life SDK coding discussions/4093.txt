ok i have done everything to get the max weapons up to the number i want just one problem left.  for weapons 33 and 34, (just the number i am up to in the weapons right now), it is bringing up fake hud slots for 1, crowbar, and 2, glock, (i figure 35 will fake 3 and so on).  Does any one know how to fix this problem?  Thank you for your time and effort.

There is a simple reason.

Weapons are stored as an integer bitmap in the player entities. This means, that each weapon has a bit attributed to it in the "weapons" variable of the player's entvars. And since weapons is an integer (i.e, stored upon 4 bytes in memory), and that one byte is made of 8 bits, you can have 4 x 8 = 32 weapons maximum...

This is true, of course, if you use the "normal" way for storing weapons in Half-Life, i.e using the method I described. Some other MOD makers circumvent this limitation by a trick, and store weapons elsewhere. After all, it's up to you to decide where you want to store your weapons...

that sounds like it makes sense my question would then be how to keep it from showing those fake hud images? sounds kinda like you think i cant raise the max weapons but i have. they are over-max fully working weapons except fake hud images. thank you for your time and effort

That's just what I say. You can add as many weapon classes as you want, but in the end the game will be confused about their ID numbers. That's the reason why you see the HUD slots starting back at zero for weapons above 32.

Is there a small example someone could give to work around this?  thank you for your time and effort.

ok i found the int weapons; entry in entity_state.h and in progdefs.h Also cd->weapons = ent->v.weapons; seems important i tried using an argument to point to another bit mask but did not have any luck.  I wil keep trying but appreciate any and all help. also i was wondering if i could make a second id to replace the id it gets confused on like the fake hud slot?  i think the last idea sounds the easiest.  thank you for your time and effort.

Instead of keeping the weapons in the player entity structure, store the weapons elsewhere. In the CBasePlayer class, for example. And instead of storing an integer bitmap, store a "long" or a "quad". Or better, define a boolean structure that you could extend every time you add a new weapon. Have a search in your MOD source code, including the client DLL, to find where the weapons variable of an entity structure is used, and replace it so as it points to your custom weapon structure.

i was under the impression that int is the same as long int, unsingned int, long unsigned int.  i have never heard of a quad though.  does not register like a c++ keyword, and not in my c++ bible. i commented out the int weapons; to see where the errors were but am very unsure how to use it.  could i just take the  int weapons; and change it to something other than a bitmap?  or how did they do it in the first place? i mean i use int usually to describe a number 1 though an amount i will never reach, lol.  basically i am trying to figure out the steps it took to use a bitmap so i can change it to another method.  is their bitmap method ,"0,1" for a bool effect?thank you for you time and effort.

i am really trying to not reinvent the wheel.  screwin around with our source and i cant find what to do. i have crammed my brain with all kinds of useless information.  since nothing is working i tried to extend the bitmap to two integers so when one limit was reached the other would pick up to atleast give a 64 weapon max but it looked like a toddler had gotten a hold of the keyboard when i started the game.  still will keep trying 24/7 unless at work or i finally pass out from sleep dep.  It is such a sweet mod i cant give up.  i really do appreciate the help i have gotten so far.

Forget about hacking the entity structure. You'd strongly better not to, since the layout of such a structure is fixed by the engine itself.

Store your player weapons elsewhere, that's what I am saying since the beginning !

i am listening to you but by simply saying to store the weapons some where else doesnt mean much to me.  infact this question is not answered anywhere.  ive infact  been trying to do what you said with no success.  the way your descibing the process also makes me think maybe you have not really done it before.  nothing very exact just some concept.  well either way i appreciate your help thank you for your time and effort.

In short, you are saying that I don't know what I'm talking about. Okay.

You have to figure things on your own a little, dude, don't expect people to write the code for you. Also instead of saying "it doesn't work" it would probably be more helpful to tell WHAT exactly does not work, and WHERE exactly your problem is.

Now sorry, you're on your own.

i hear ya it is just so frustrating.  i dont want the code i know that is a no no.  i just cant understand what you mean by storing them somewhere else.  i am guessing that being stored in an int bit mask means that the compiler makes the adress in the memory under the int name "weapons" and that it is like you said 4 bytes or 32 bits big.  i have been working hard as the only coder on our mod.  i started about 2 months ago from scratch, (no prior programing knowledge). i did my own class and team structure figured out my own way to make the weapons and have them work perfectly in the mod while starting from the models the modeler made. how to get the monsters deaths count properly in the game.  a cam clip that actually works to very specific requests<-alot of crap.  and all kinds of little desired changes and tweaks overall.  i definately did not mean to offend and never asked for you to write the code for me.  just wanted an example of some sort to figure out what you are saying to me.  it does not make sense to me because i have found nothing in alot of literature ,(online c++ classes, c++ tuts, and my c++ bible book),  that has a quad or bit masks.  i have on the other hand seen how to adress things to the memory with 0xff stuff but not the "bitmap" thing at all.  it seems that the problem is like you say it is getting confused on the id of the weapons.  i would really like an insight on what you are explaning so i can fix it.  alas you are angry because i put "the way your descibing the process also makes me think maybe you have not really done it before".  this is not a very rational reason to get mad, since i only said from what i have been told i am forced to make a decision about its validity.  with that said i thank you for your effort in trying to help me anyway.

The 'int' used to store the weapon bit flag is 32 bits.  One of these bits is used by the HEV suit (WEAPON_SUIT), so you have 31 bits left to store a flag for each weapon.

The m_rgpPlayerItems[] array is used on the server to store the pointers to weapon classes (each slot in this array is reserved for a specific weapon).

The weapon information that's sent to the client (the ItemInfo structure), stores the weapon ID in the iId field).

The client stores the weapons as bits in the HUD m_iWeaponBits array.

Most of the changes required to support more than 31 weapons will be on the client side.  You should be able to comment out the m_iWeaponBits field and rebuild the client to find all the places that need to change.

Maybe that will help you figure out what you need to change.

(P.S. fix the shift key on your keyboard.)

Actually, you can quite easily change the maximum weapons to 45 with very little code.
Im not sure why 45 is the magic number. I've tried many different values but 45 is the only one that works.



On the server side, go into cdll_dll.h and change MAX_WEAPONS to 45.

In weapons.h change MAX_WEAPONS to 45.

Now recompile BOTH the server dll and client dll. And there you go.

Anyone know why this works? I find it odd that 45 is the only number besides 32 that works.
