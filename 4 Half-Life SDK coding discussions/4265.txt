Hey botman. I am wonking with some ppl to make an airsoft mod. airsoft is sorta like paint ball ne way.I am basing the gun off of the crossbow.I have been working to make the ball that now shoots from the crossbow to bounce off of a wall and fall to the ground. I kinda got it but somtimes the ball would float up walls really wierd stuff. what i wanted to know was can ya help point me in the right direction i want the ball to shoot kinda like the m203 shot from the mp5 but i want it to bounce off the walls and then fall on the ground. thnx for reading see ya.

Why not starting with the grenade code ? I think paintballs can be assimilated to grenades in some way, at least for the trajectory. All you'll have to do is to add a check on the paintball (grenade) so that when it DispatchTouch()es someone, the guy gets hurt.
