I have created an item which increases the maximum ammo capacity the player can carry. However, when I tried this: 

int CAK47::GetItemInfo(ItemInfo *p) 
{ 
  p->pszName = STRING(pev->classname); 
  p->pszAmmo1 = "762Nato"; 
  if ( m_pPlayer->m_fBackpack == TRUE)//if player has the backpack 
  { 
    p->iMaxAmmo1 = _762MM_MAXCARRY2; //180 max carry ammo 
  else ( m_pPlayer->m_fBackpack == FALSE)//if player doesn't have the backpack 
  { 
    p->iMaxAmmo1 = _762MM_MAXCARRY; //90 max carry ammo 
  } 
  p->pszAmmo2 = NULL; 
  p->iMaxAmmo2 = -1; 
  p->iMaxClip = AK47_MAX_CLIP; 
  p->iSlot = 3; 
  p->iPosition = 0; 
  p->iFlags = 0; 
  p->iId = m_iId = WEAPON_AK47; 
  p->iWeight = AK47_WEIGHT; 

  return 1; 
} 

Half-Life crashes when I load the game. Is this the correct way? Or is there another way? Thank you

:).  I would also just put "else{dowhatever;}" instead of "else(whatever){dowhatever;}", like I did in example above.

Oh yeah, forgot the '}' while typing the code into this forum. But it seems whatever code I enter to this area, HL always crash when I start it up.

Hmm, maybe it has something to do with having a '_' in front of the max ammo name. It wouldn't give an error about that while compiling so that may be it. Instead (since those type of things cant start with a number) just rename it MAXCARRY_762MM and see if it works.

Not exactly. Valve also defined a few values using the '_'. The reason the underscore was added is because the compiler would get errors if you are defining numbers to numbers e.g. 

#define 57  200

Definitions like these will cause errors.

Now back to my question, thank you.

Try removing the "if" statement temporarily.

Where does GetItemInfo() get called from?  Do you know for CERTAIN that m_pPlayer will always be non-NULL when this function is called?

- I assume Botman here is asking where is this function being called. Well, it's being called in the ak47.cpp

Do you know for CERTAIN that m_pPlayer will always be non-NULL when this function is called?
- Oh, that answers a few things. But what is the correct way to do this?

Something like...
code:
if (m_pPlayer != NULL)
{
   // do stuff with m_pPlayer here
}
else
{
   ClientPrintf(blah, blah, blah, "Tried to use NULL m_pPlayer!!!");
}

Ok, I'll try that and see if it works. Thanks!
