i am using the weapon from counter-strike and in thirdperson view the muzzle flash is at the attachment where the shells eject, how do i make the muzzle flash to be at the second attachment or where in the code can i find the bit to figure out how to get the location of any attachments?

Muzzle flashes are usually compiled into the model.  You would need the original .qc file and the sources for the models to recompile them.

hmm, i know the muzzle flash for first person is compiled into the models qc file but is that the same muzzle flash origin for third-person view?

I noticed there are to sprites muzzleflash1.spr, muzzleflash2.spr(or something) in the sprites dir... 

And cant you decompile models using Milkshape if you need to edit them?
