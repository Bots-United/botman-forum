Okay, Have you seen Dev C++? It's IDE.
Find it on Google.
It's a good compiler and I hope the source code files might be modified for it mabye..

But, since it's not I was trying to compile the SDK using MinGW. But my .Bat file kept saying out of enviroment space. It has the right path in it and everything though. So what could this mean?

If anybody knows and is around at the momment please reply..

Modified-> ( This just occured to me that it might not have to do directly with my computer.
Mabye if somebody could make the .bat file and host it. With the dir being C:\MingGW. It might work because it was a problem with my coding or notpad, etc. )

"But my .Bat file kept saying out of enviroment space."

Add this to the end of your C:\config.sys file (it's just a text file, open it with Notepad)...
code:
shell = C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /p /e:2048

...that will give you 2048 bytes of environment space (the default is 512 I think).

Save the file, then reboot your computer and run the .bat file again.

Thanks, that gave me the enviroment space and began MINGW.bat. But as I am compiling my crossbow.o is giving error 1.

It was a problem in the c++ code.
Of crossbow.cpp.. Something in the void of firesniperbolt.

? I was scanning through the earlier posts in this page and I found millions others identical to mine. In one you said to use 2.0 if using MinGW..

So is that what I must do? I don't want to get to serious in this modding yet. Just change weapons, etc. I've been reseraching how to.

Nope, that's the airtank problem.
So.. I must update it again up to 2.2....
Then there is the same crossbow error. It says void firesniperbolt error.........
