Can you take sceenshots from a server? I.e. I'd like to be able to take a screenshot from a point in the game automatically within the server... It's hard to explain.

For example, If my "player logger" program notices something dodgy, could I take an IMAGE screenshot (bmp/tga) from where I want to observe it?

If you can understand what im talking about then, help me hehe :)

You can't take a screen shot from a dedicated server, since the dedicated server has no "camera" from which to take a screen shot from.

You can send the "snapshot" command to a client to force the client to take a screen shot (via the CLIENT_COMMAND function), but you don't have any way to transfer this file from the client to the server.  If the server is running a listenserver then you don't have to worry about that since the client and the server are on the same machine (of course this won't work on normal Linux servers).

If you want to allow the dedicated server to take screen shots, perhaps you can take my BSP tools and integrate the BSP viewer into your code.  This will allow you to create a "virtual" OpenGL display where you can position the camera anywhere you want, then save the rendered video frame to a file.  This was something that I had meant to implement eventually in the BSP viewer but haven't had time to add this feature to it yet.  Of course, you won't see any of the client side effects (like beams, wall hacks, etc.) that might be used by cheaters to track player positions.
