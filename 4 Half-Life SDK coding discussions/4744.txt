I am building a CS game launcher and I have been struggling with something.

Can anyone tell me how to detect if there is a LAN game?

Try checking the "sv_lan" CVAR variable.  It should always by "1" for a LAN game.

Right.  That I understand.  What I am trying to figure out is how to detect if there is already a LAN game running somewhere on the network.  Essentially, the equivilant of going into CS and clicking 'Play on LAN'.  CS then checks for all LAN games to which I have access, and lists them.  That is the step I am trying to duplicate.  I assume its something like testing different network ips across a standard set of ports.  But I am not sure what I would be checking for.  Does anyone know an easy way to do this?

Sorry for not explaining myself better in my original question.

Send out an IP broadcast packet to the default server port and wait for 3-5 seconds to see if any hosts respond.

Broadcasts will be limited to the LAN and won't propagate out to the Internet even if there is a Internet connection.

You can search on www.google.com for examples of sending IP packets using a broadcast packet (try searching for "windows socket broadcast packet" or something similar).
