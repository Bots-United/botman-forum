You would probably be better off doing a non-VGUI menu than getting into VGUI right away. Just remember that when you do a ShowMenu that the command that is coming back when they select something is "menuselect X", where X is what they chose. Take a look at this for some help: http://hlpp.telefragged.com/tuts/finalmenu.htm

Actually the command could be anything else, provided the gamedll on the server interprets it as such. You could, for example, code your gamedll and your client DLL to send messages that would be called "DaFùckinBuyMenuOfHell" and clients would send back clientcommands that would be "gimmethatstuff X", or anything else. Even, sending back a clientcommand is not necessarily the only way to do it. The client could as well send another network message, that the gamedll would interpret as a buy menu action. It's all up to the programmer.
