Isn't it in the game engine or something?

See the PM_Jump() function in pm_shared\pm_shared.c (this is used by both the server DLL and the client DLL).

Isn't it another way ? I remind of some servers that had a kind of "Matrix jump mode", I believe it must be a Metamod plugin... If you can do it this way, you won't have to compile a specific server neither client DLL.

Matrix mode is easy to do, you don't need Admin Mod / Metamod to do it. It changes something in sv_airsomething kind of like sv_gravity etc...

the command is sv_airaccelerate -15 for "Matrix jumping"
