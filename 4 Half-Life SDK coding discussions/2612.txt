Okay, i already found on another forum howto make a snark "cam"
code:

      if( bCameSnark == false)
      {
              
            SET_VIEW (m_pPlayer->edict(), pSqueak->edict());
         bCameSnark = true;
      }else{
            
            SET_VIEW (m_pPlayer->edict(), m_pPlayer->edict());
            bCameSnark = false;
      } 





work's fine, but ONE problem...
when i have 2 entity's of a snark spawned
it sets  the view in some odd area of the snarks

so does anyone have an idea how can i make it only toggel the view of ONE snark....?

You would have to add a variable to the CBasePlayer class to store the snark that you wanted to use for that player.

Let's say a player spawns a snark and you wanted that player to view from that snark.  When the snark is thrown by the player, just store a pointer to the snark entity (from the Create function) in that player's CBasePlayer class variable (let's call it pSnark), then somewhere in the player.cpp file you would have a function to SET_VIEW to the pSnark entity...
code:
if (pSnark != NULL)
   SET_VIEW(edict(), pSnark->edict());
