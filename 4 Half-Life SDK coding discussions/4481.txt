ok can somone help me out i would like the snarks not to follow the owner. I see how they do it in the beegun thing

code:

=========================================================
// ID's Hornet as their owner
//=========================================================
int CHornet::Classify ( void )
{

      if ( pev->owner && pev->owner->v.flags & FL_CLIENT)
      {
            return CLASS_PLAYER_BIOWEAPON;
      }

      return      CLASS_ALIEN_BIOWEAPON;
}

      return CLASS_ALIEN_BIOWEAPON;

that not how hornets identify their owner, if you notice, it is possible to make hornets attack their owner by running whilst shooting, I dont think they have a check.

Basically add something to the snarks like:

if(m_hEnemy != pev->owner)
   attack( );

it was not code ot copy and paste, the idea is you do it yourself, what I wrote was the basic idea. Override the function that returns the relationship between the snark and the player, and retrun "R_NO" if its the owner. Its trivial to do.
