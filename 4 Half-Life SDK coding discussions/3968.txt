In the entvars_t structure the maximum health is the 'pev->max_health' field.  This is often times set in the Spawn() function for that entity.

before asking questions like these, you SHOULD look through the members of the entity structure, as the variable you are looking for is probably in there

why is it that when i set the max armor in weapons.h

#define MAX_NORMAL_BATTERY 200

i can get up to 200 with batteries but i cannot with a HEV suit charger?

Maybe because the HEV suit charger code does not take in account this value and sticks to 100 as maximum. Look in the HEV suit charger code for the place where the charger is denied to work.

PS. Try to do a little search on your own. You ask many many questions you could work out by yourself with a minimum amount of work. One day people will get tired of helping you.
