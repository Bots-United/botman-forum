I finally got a copy of ms C++ 6.0 (standard). I was reading your "The unofficial Half-Life MOD FAQ" where it says ". How do I build the mp.dll file for multiplayer MODs?". It tells me to open my sdk/dlls/mp.dsw file. We'll, I don't have that file in my folder. I have SDK 2.2 Full but no .dsw file. What could the problem be?

The Full SDK has hl.dsp (open it).  The Standard SDK has mp.dsp (which you don't have).

Cool. Thanx. That whole .dsp/.dsw thing threw me off a bit
