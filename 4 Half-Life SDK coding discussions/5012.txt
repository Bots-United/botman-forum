Hi, I've hit a little snag. Im wondering if any of you guys have a solution for me (other wise I may have to post on the hlcoding list). I need to get a player's current team in counter-strike without using their model to get the team. Mods like TFC has pev->team as their team, counter-strike does not seem to have the same, any ideas?

The team is stored somewhere in the pvPrivateData block (search this forum for "pvPrivateData").  You'll have to identify which byte (or int) is used to store the team value yourself (unless someone else volunteers this information).  You can probably do this fairly easily by dumping the block, changing teams, then dumping the block again to see what changed.

Why can't you use the player's model?

My server supports custom player models, so I cant tell which team a person is on when they change their model (I'm trying to set up color maps like TFC).

Ok, I figured out how to get it to work. I caught the client index in the ScoreInfo message and the team number and stored it in pev->team variable.

Now this is a good idea ! Can I borrow it for my bots ?

Sure, you want me to post the code for getting the team from client messages?

if you're intersted to do it without messages, you might wonna try to play around with pvPrivateData...

code:

(in ClientCommand)
int srch = atoi(CMD_ARGV(1));
            float fsrch = atof(CMD_ARGV(2));
            CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, UTIL_VarArgs("Looking for (int) %d in your player private data...\n", srch));
            CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, UTIL_VarArgs("Looking for (float) %f in your player private data...\n", fsrch));
            CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, UTIL_VarArgs("Looking for (string) %s in your player private data...\n", CMD_ARGV(3)));
            unsigned char *p;   
            p = (unsigned char *)GET_PRIVATE(pEntity); 
            for (int index = 0; p && index < 1000; index++)
            {
                  if (*(int*)p == srch)
                        CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, UTIL_VarArgs("The value of (int) %d was found at address %p, which is offset %d\n", srch, p, index));
                  else if (fsrch && *(float*)p == fsrch)
                        CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, UTIL_VarArgs("The value of (float) %f was found at address %p, which is offset %d\n", fsrch, p, index));
                  else if (CMD_ARGV(3) && *(char *)p && FStrEq((char *)p, CMD_ARGV(3)))
                        CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, UTIL_VarArgs("The value of (char) %s was found at address %p, which is offset %d\n", CMD_ARGV(3), p, index));
                  p++;
            }
            CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, UTIL_VarArgs("Done!\n"));



Feel free to change it...
(the string only uses the 3rd value... no spaces)
trace <int> <float> <string>
