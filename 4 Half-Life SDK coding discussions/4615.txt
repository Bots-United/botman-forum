i have followed a tutorial on how to make semi-auto weapons, found at planet half-life.com (http://www.planethalflife.com/hlprogramming/tutorial.asp?i=25)
 i followed it and found that it worked great, but when u hold on to the trigger, it doesnt stop firing, and doesnt use up any ammo. does anyone know the fix for this? here's the code:

void CGlock::PrimaryAttack( void )
{
//Start Presscode
if(! ( m_pPlayer->m_afButtonPressed & IN_ATTACK ) )
return;
// Well this is the function for that 1 pres 1 shoot etc 

GlockFire( 0.1, 0.15, TRUE );
//End Presscode

the shotgun is "automatic" too, because if u hold down the trigger, it will always fire continuously, not semi-automatically. I am trying to make a pistol so that clicking fires once, so to fire again u have to let go and click again.
