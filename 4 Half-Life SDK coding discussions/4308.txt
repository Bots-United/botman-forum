If theres already a thread, then my appologies, can I have the link?

On the start of a new round I need all the entities removed, decals, and sounds half way through playing to go. I can implement it myself I just need the code to loop through and remove entities.

Thanks!

try...

code:


int i;

// make i begin above where players are stored, so you dont kill players from the engine.
for ( i = gpGlobals->maxClients + 1; i <= gpGlobals->maxEntities; i++ )
{
   if ( want_to_destroy )
   {
     INDEXENT(i)->v.flags = FL_KILLME;
   }
}

It crashes, does it only work on the lastest SDK?

Doesn't like:
INDEXENT(ANY_VALUE)->v.flags = FL_KILLME;

Are you trying to destroy ALL entities or are you checking the classname field to only destroy the ones you want?

To remove decals (since they aren't entities), you can set the the mp_decal cvar down to 1, wait a second, and then set it back to the default value.

Normal, I guess Cheesy wrote this in a rush ;)
Try
code:

edict_t *pEntity;
int i;

// make i begin above where players are stored, so you dont kill players from the engine.
for ( i = gpGlobals->maxClients + 1; i <= gpGlobals->maxEntities; i++ )
{
  pEntity = INDEXENT (i); // link a pointer to entity #i

  if (FNullEnt (pEntity))
    continue; // reliability check, not all entity slots are always taken

  if (want_to_destroy)
    pEntity->v.flags |= FL_KILLME;
}


Should work a lil better.

Thanks so much!

Playing with this new nugget of information all day!

I can't come to a method of making sure that only entites that are not in the map disappear.

What I mean is, I want the weapon that belongs to the map to stay and the one the player drops at death to disappear.

The only meathod I can think of is very messy coding.
