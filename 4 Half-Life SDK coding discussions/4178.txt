Subject: Cloning new Barney for single player mod ... Help!
--------------------------------------------------

Firstly ... I've got Half-Life v1110, Hammer3.4, HL ModelViewer, Milkshape, botman's patched full SDK2.2, and I am compiling DLLs with Borland C++ 5.5, thanks to botman's great instructions.

I'm working on a new plot-driven single player mod and I am wanting to add a new unique Barney-based character, in addition to the old Barney we know and love. For now I just want to get him to do general Barney stuff, but look different. I'll add custom sounds and actions later on.

I've successfully created a newly skinned Barney model called "barneyred.mdl". It views fine in HLMV. I can add it to my maps in Hammer as a "monster_generic" - it shows up in my mod when I do that.

I've also edited my FGD file and got it set up as "monster_barneyred", and can add it as an entity in Hammer like that. However, it just doesn't appear in my mod when I run the map. 

Obviously, I've created a new CPP file called "barneyred.cpp" and amended by hand all references to "barney" to read "barneyred" etc. I've also followed tutorials elsewhere to amend other related files, though I can't recall which ones because I didn't make any notes (doh!)

I did follow the chumtoad tutorial at http://planethalflife.com/hlsdk2/sdk/new_monster_chumtoad.htm but I still couldn't get it to work.

My HL.DLL seems to compile okay, but my new Barney 'Red' Calhoun character just doesn't appear in my mod when playing. It's driving me bonkers!

I guess what I need to know is EXACTLY what DLL source files I need to amend for my new Barney, and how it all relates. There must be more than just adding the "barneyred" references alondside the normal "barney" ones. I'm sure I'm missing something somewhere.

I'm a professional web developer by trade but an absolute beginner at game modding and C++ coding. I've got a fairly good brain in my head and I've been getting on really well going from making crappy hollow blocks in Hammer to compiling modified dlls in just a few days!!! So please don't let my noob status put you off helping me out here.

Also, can anybody tell me why 'Chapter Title Message' in Map Properties doesn't work? All my other in-game triggered messages do. I point it to MAP01TITLE and I have a MAP01TITLE message in the 'titles.txt' in my mod root directory.

Thanks!

You had the same problem that I had when I was using that compiler. Look in your project directory for a file (it isn't a cpp or h file) which has all the names of enitries. i think it's has a .def extenison. add barneyred to that list.

Yes, add "monster_barneyred = _monster_barneyred" to the end of the bcc_hl.def file in the dlls folder, then run 'make' to build the DLL.  This will export that name without the leading underscore that Borland puts at the beginning of function names.

Great, thanks a lot Drahcir and botman, thats sorted it out. My new sidekick Red Calhoun is now appearing and popping lead into a 'super-zombie'. Or, 'genetic-level-biological-weapons-experiment-gone-wrong', as my plot refers to them.

Now that I have got that working I can go ahead and create lots of other lovely new characters.

Still, if anyone could oblige me, I wouldn't mind a straight list of all files that need to be created/amended when adding a new Barney or Scientist-based character.

One thing I was wondering is: if I create a new 'skills.cfg' in the root of my mod, does that overide the standard Half-Life one?

UPDATE: Okay, forget about that skills question, it does overide. My Red Barney is now super tough.

Cheers!
