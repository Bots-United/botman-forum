I know that you need C++ skill to create bots. But do you need C++ for mod-development or just SDK? Is it good to know things in C++ for the development of a mod?

To develop code for a MOD you need the SDK (which is all written in C++) and you need to understand how to program in C++.

Although you can prolly add a couple of weapons and stuff through copy-pasting and editing (but c++ knowledge is also needed a bit for that)
