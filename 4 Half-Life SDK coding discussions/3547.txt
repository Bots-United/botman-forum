"too many parameters" would indicate you don't have something correct in your batch file.  Post the contents of you bcc.bat file.

SET BCC_DIR=C:\Program Files\borland
PATH=%BCC_DIR%\bin;%PATH%

The path to my borland file is correct, is ther somthing else that is wrong?

Try...

SET BCC_DIR="C:\Program Files\borland"
PATH=%BCC_DIR%\bin;%PATH%

...instead.

Actually, what I would do (since MS-DOS doesn't like paths with spaces in the directory name) is install the Borland compiler in C:\Borland and be done with it.

ok i changed the directory to C:\Borland\BCC55 and update the bcc32 and link m32, as well as creating a new BCC.BAT file.

now when i run BCC.BAT it just gives me this-

c:\Borland\BCC55>SET BCC_DIR=c:\borland\Bcc55
c:\borland\BCC55>PATH=c:\Borland\Bcc55\bin;c:\WINDOWS;c:\windows\COMMAND

what do i do now?

"what do i do now?"

Follow the rest of the ReadMe.txt file.

im confused, ive run BCC.BAT and i have gone to the dlls file to run make, but its not there.

and i supposed type this:
c:\Borland> cd "\Half-Life\SDK\Source Code\dlls"
in the BCC.BAT dos window and then type "make"? because nothing happens when i type.

Make.exe is found in the Borland\bcc55\bin directory.  You add the Boland bin directory to your path so that MS-DOS can find the "make" command no matter what directory you are in.

When you change to the SDK "dlls" directory and type make, make.exe will look for a file called "makefile".  The isn't a "makefile" by default with my SDK 2.2 patches.  You have to copy "makefile_borland" or "makefile_mingw" to "makefile" (depending on whether you are using the Borland compiler or the MinGW compiler).  In your case you want to copy "makefile_borland" to "makefile", and then run make to build the DLL.

ive made the makefiles, and ive run BCC.BAT. what next?

"When you change to the SDK "dlls" directory and type make, make.exe will look for a file called "makefile""

where do i type "make"? do i change to the folder literally or do i type that somwhere?

sorry for keeping asking questions but this is really getting at me.

You use the MS-DOS command "cd" to change directories to whatever directory you installed the Half-Life SDK in (see the ReadMe.txt file for my example).

If you have problems setting things up or running the commands, I recommend that you install the compiler and the Half-Life SDK in EXACTLY the same places that I did.  That way you can just type everything thing in EXACTLY as it appears in the ReadMe.txt file and you don't have to figure out what is the same and what is different based on where you installed things.
