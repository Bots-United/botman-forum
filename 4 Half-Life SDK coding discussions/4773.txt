I have a big problem with that because i need it to stay 1000 and everytime i reconnect or server changes map cl_rate goes 9999.
The config.cfg read only solution is not working neither the autoexec.cfg with cl_rate 9999.
Any ideas??

Check to see if it is being set in one of your .cfg files (server.cfg, user.cfg, etc.).

There is not such setting in my server.cfg and i do not have/use any user.cfg.
It is still strange and really annoying to keep changing to 9999.
I think this "cl_rate" thing is hardcoded in some dll of the game, is there any way to find where and how to edit this value?

You couldn't change it if it were hard coded.

Try sticking the value you want in your config.cfg file and see if that fixed it.

Nope, sry it didn`t fixed it, i tried this so many times, no matter what the value in config.cfg the cl_rate returns to 9999 just when i`m connected to server.
Of course i can change it later in the game in console but every map change or reconnect cl_rate returns to value of 9999.
This is some weird situation, i mean not even read-only config.cfg wit cl_rate my value didn`t worked.
