This is code when player shoot, create wallpuff :
PLAYBACK_EVENT_FULL( FEV_GLOBAL, m_pPlayer->edict(), m_usSmoke, 0.0, (float *)&g_vecZero, (float *)&g_vecZero, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 );

m_pPlayer->edict() - player shoot

What put instead of m_pPlayer that monster shoot ?

<monster ?>->edict() - monster shoot

m_pPlayer is a member variable of the weapon class.  The weapon keeps track of which player is holding it.  The weapons that are held by monsters don't work the same way (i.e. the weapon for monsters is more like a part of the monster's body than a separate entity).

You will need to modify each of the monster .cpp files and create a network message to send to the client when the monster shoots.  Let's take the hgrunt (human military grunt) as an example.  In hgrunt.cpp you find the CHGrunt::Shoot() function.  You would add a network message here to send the event to the client, then add code in the client to play back that event (similar to how the events for player's shooting weapons is done in the client).

It's not a one line change.
