Hi Botman! I don't want people in my mod cheating, exactly using Impulse101, they can use it in singleplayer, but not in multiplayer game.

I want to print text to all HL players when impulse 101 is called. For example:

"Player %s used IMPULSE_101 command!"

I know ehre impulse 101 function is, but how can I print text to all players and to get players name?

There are many different ways to print text on the client.  The simplest method is to do what the "say" command does.  Look at the UTIL functions that the "say" or "say_team" commands use.

The player's name will be stored in the pev->netname variable.  You will need to use the STRING() macro to convert it from a string_t integer to a char pointer like this...
code:
char player_name[32];
 
strcpy(player_name, STRING(pPlayer->pev->netname));
