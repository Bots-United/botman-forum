I done this mod of mine of HL. But something is wrong! Everytime you land from a height you are sure of being left with at least 30%, you die and gib instantly.

I suspect is the "player_max_fatal_speed" or something in the player.cpp. I used valve's default values and this happens! Would someone please be my saviour?

Did you change the sv_gravity server CVAR setting?  I think the default is 800 units per second.

Nope, I did not edit anything in the player.cpp or the player.h. I used the default values.

There's something wrong with the HL SDK2.2 also. I compile it WITHOUT changing anything and still get the same problem.

well, thats normal, because only in multiplayer the damage amounts drop to 10, in sp they are calculated differently

So.....what are the values I should change to survive that kind of fall? Anyone?

Take a look at CHalfLifeMultiplay::FlPlayerFallDamage for multiplayer or CHalfLifeRules::FlPlayerFallDamage for single player.

Thanks to those who have helped! But I solved the problem! The problem is that I've used VC++ 5. Yes, no matter what patch, VC++ 5 caused this bug.
Now I use VC++ 6, that bug is history. So everyone, heed my advice: Use VC++ 6 to compile HL SDK 2.2 for a bug free game. ((_.
