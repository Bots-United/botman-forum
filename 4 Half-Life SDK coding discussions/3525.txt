hi all,

well i have two questions that hopefully the more advanced coders could please answer for me...
( btw these are not "how to" questions, but more like "is this possible" questions.=] )

1] Could you add acceleration and deccelaration to a player so that when they move, it takes a short while to get to normal speed, and then when they release the button, it takes a short while to stop still.
I know this could be possible, but havent a clue about coding the velocity issues.

2] I was also thinking about when a player runs into a wall, they take a little damage and when they run into other people the other person takes some damage, and the player also takes a little.

Thanx for all your help guys. =] (plz)

Acceleration already exists in the physics code.  Look in pm_shared.c - I think the function is PM_Accelerate.

The second question is possible - it would be also done in the physics code or maybe in CBP::PostThink.
