I don't know of one but all you've got to do is make a new weapon, change the attack to find the player you've targtted, set the FL_FROZEN bit on the players pev->flags, and set their glow shell to a freezy blue colour !

anyway that might seem a bit much if you are new to everything!

Wavelength just moved to a new server.  It doesn't look like the content of the hosted site (hlpp) got moved.

You might e-mail one of the guys at Wavelength to see if the content from hlpp will get moved as well.
