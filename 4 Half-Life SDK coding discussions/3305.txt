Hi everybody!

Could you guys give me some stuff for the console and in the game, like when you open the console, it types "Console opened..." etc.
I'd like something like when you kill someone it says something in center of the screen "You killed (player's name)..."...

I could need a lot of stuff like that :D
Just post a list, thank you!

I've never seen any method to determine if the player has pulled down the console or not.  The client continues running and sends packets back and forth to the server whether the console is down or not (you can see this because you often get killed while you console is down).

As far as the messages to the HUD goes, check the util.cpp file for various types of messages that can be sent to a client.  (search for "MESSAGE_BEGIN" to find them).

I didn't mean it like that.
Not other players can see that you do it, but only your self will get a message in the console.

Btw., it's no problem if you can't make that.
I just asked for some codes to print some text on the screen etc...

this is using botmans template... dunno what clientprint is in SDK...

code:

char msg[100];

sprintf(msg,"You killed %s\n",STRING(m_pKilled->pev->netname));

ClientPrint(m_pPlayer,HUD_PRINTCENTER,msg);



hmm......?
