Don't mind this question but what happened to the HL SDK forums? Can't seem to access them these few days. Or have they moved to a new page?

Sorry for the late reply, I screwed up my desktop a little and was banned for using the net for a few days. :( But that's another story.

Here's the URL: http://www.chatbear.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=boardlisting&boardid=943&view=flatold

The collective.valve-erc.com/index.phpVERC stuff was consolidated.

The new VERC forums are here...

Many of the old posts in the 'Coding' forum were moved to the new forum.
