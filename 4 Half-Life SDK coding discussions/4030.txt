I'm just wondering if this is possible before I break my brain trying to implement it:

I'd like to write a small file containing the ip address and port of the server I'm connected to.  Either automatically, or with a console command ("logconnect"?).

Can it be done?

needs to be already implemented in the MOD client dll, or you'll have to make a client side dll hook which HL won't allow.

But I dont have the best answer either ;).

Creating a file is easy...
code:
FILE *fp = fopen("file.txt", "w");
fprintf(fp, "Hi there!\n");
fclose(fp);

In order to get information from the server, you would need to send a custom command to the server and have the server respond with the host IP address and port number.

You don't indicate whether you are trying to create your own MOD or are trying to access something using an existing MOD that you don't have the source code to.  Like cheesemonster said, if you don't have the source code to the MOD, you can't modify the behavior of the client.

I was thinking of something to use on the client end, with any mod.  It was the MP3-player doo-dad that announces what MP3 you're listening to that led me to believe it was a possibility.

I'd need to ask the server for it's address?  Wouldn't the client already have it?

Um... to clarify, basically I want something to indicate to people who are wondering what server I'm on.  I can do most of what I want in perl, and was hoping to avoid opening up netstat or tcpdump just to grab the server address.

(Why I need to do it this way?  Due to system awkwardness, I have to use the in-game browser, and alt-tabbing tends to do unpleasant things.)

I don't know of any way to get that kind of information out of the client other than creating a client-side cheat which Vavle tries to prevent with is VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) software in MODs like TFC, CS, etc.
