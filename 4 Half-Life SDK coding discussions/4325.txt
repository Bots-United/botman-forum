I am trying to eliminate the sound for when then player falls farther than he should , it makes this annoying sound like a rubber ducky, or a buzz sound. i dont know how else to explain it, its called pl_fallpain3 or pl_pain2.wav, anyways, i commented out pm_checkfalling in pm_shared, where the wav is played, and it still does it. cant find any other reference to the wav file

You could just make a pl_pain2.wav that doesnt contain any sound...
