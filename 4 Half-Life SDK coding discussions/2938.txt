hi again
I have two questions today.
1- If I had to add a "void Cbiggun::TertiaryAttack( void )", are there any other files that I would have to edit or add to?

2- How is the gpGlobals->time calculated and where?

thanx a bundle.

1. If you are adding a new class (called Cbiggun) you would need to create the class definition ("class Cbiggun") which is usually placed in a header file (.h) but can be placed in the C++ file (.cpp) if you only need to use that class in a single .cpp file.

The class definition will have the prototype for member functions ("void TertiaryAttack(void);") and any member variables that the class will need.

2. gpGlobals->time is updated by the Half-Life engine.  All of the variables pointed to by gpGlobals is updated by the Half-Life engine.

Thanx,

I was thinking of puting a point system on my mod (eg. 1 kill=10 points, or something), but dont know how.

HA 
i was looking through weapons.h and saw that if you had to add more attacks(eg TertiaryAttack)
you have to delcare it their, as wellas delaring "m_flNextTertiaryAttack" etc.
so take that.
