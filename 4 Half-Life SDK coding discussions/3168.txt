Take a look at the Egon gun weapon in the SDK.  It has an attachment point on the player.

but still there is no example on attaching the beam to different model parts (as in schochtrooper). Maybe you can help with that?

So, can anyone help me with that? How can I attach three beams to different parts of model.
Start point is plyers edict() and ends are the parts of model. Any ideas?

See TE_PLAYERATTACHMENTs, but I don't know if that's what you want since I don't understand your question (still).

You NEED to have attachment points built into the model.  You can't just randomly attach things at any point you want in the model.

oh yes, I understand his question now. ;D

Impossible with the standard Half-Life models. Like botman said, weapons and whatever a player can hold in his hand is attached to his model through an attach point. That's why, amongst other things, it is damn hard for a bot maker to make his bot aim at different parts of the model (arm, leg...) - I know, I already had this problem. Have you ever tried to decompile the standard HL models ? You would learn a lot of it.

I think it's "$attachment_point" in the .qc file.

Check some modeling tutorial web sites for Half-Life.  They will have this information.
