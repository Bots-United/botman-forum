well I am pretty new at this compiling thing so I have been messing around with the files.  Well I wanted to put turn the mp5 into the m4.  well I acomplished this even though the sound is wrong and animations are way off.  Well then I delved into this mp5.cpp file and started screwing things up.  well what I did was I saved it and realised all I did was screw everything up then deleted the file altogether.  So then I went on the internet and looked up the file.  I have the same exact file now but when I compile it will say error C2011: 'CMP5' : 'class' type redefinition Error executing cl.exe "  I am guesing that you can't have 2 of the same classes, which I do have.  Can you guys help??

it says the class CMP5 is redefined.

Are you using Microsoft visual C? In that case just double click on the error and it will direct you to it.
