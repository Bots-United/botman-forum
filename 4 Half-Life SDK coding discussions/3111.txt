I saw a snippet of code on a forum, which I can no longer locate, where the code for keeping track of kills was modified to add to the score if the player killed a monster. I would like to modify the code to track killing and being killed by monsters. Can anyone point me in the right direction? I'm thinking this would just be a server side moficiation so once done and compiled it would just need to be included in my HLDS directory.

Thanks in advance,

have a look at:

void CBaseMonster :: Killed( entvars_t *pevAttacker, int iGib )

I guess you could get the player from pevAttacker->pContaintingEntity i think and increase monsters killed.

If that doesnt workj look at TakeDamage function in CBaseMonster and check if the monster will be killed on that attack.

Open up combat.cpp and at the top put:

#include "player.h"

then follow this tut:
