...and I love the community it has worldspawned.

Sorry to be off topic, but I just want to say I still think Half-Life is the still the greatest and everyone who bothers coding new mods for it, sharing their knowledge and keeping it all alive five years later is a real dood.

I seem to be living a Half-Life at the moment, whilst my web design commissions are thin on the ground, and I think, in the past few months, I've played probably about 25% of the single player mods that are out there.

I've taken up modding myself fairly recently and I have to say it's so satisfying making new Barneys and creating new locations, not to mention the fun I've had putting a plot together and making it come alive. It will be quite some time before I release anything though.

I don't care if the engine is ancient and the latest games make Half-Life look like Donkey Kong... it still looks, feels and plays great - and the creativity and activity of the modding community is unsurpassed.

So yeah! for Half-Life and yeah! for all you people.

I just thought I would share that with you.

PS: Don't worry, I do have a real life - I went on the recent huge anti-war demo in London, I went to the theatre tonight, I'm going to see a man about an arty website in conjunction with the BBC tomorrow, and then I'm off to meet my local MP in the evening to grill him about some things. So Real-Life is pretty good too. But I always look forward to pumping a few rounds into some special forces grunts and exploring make-believe underground science bases when I can.

PPS: I'm playing ETC at the moment. It's pretty good for an early mod. My fave mods are 'Poke646' and 'Someplace Else'. And I'm especially looking forward to 'Nightwatch'.

Check out Half-Quake: Amen at www.halfquake.com
The mod makes every other mod in existence look like mouse shit in comparison. Should win awards in my opinion.

And I agree that the Half-Life engine is #1 for modding and has one of the best communities of all.
The only other game coming out since Half-Life that I'm looking forward to is Postal 2 which will be out soon, due to it also having a great engine and excellent modding capabilities.

If Half-Life were just to graphically update a bit, and maybe allow larger maps, then it would remain #1 for a long time to come.

Can't seem to get through to the HalfQuake website right now. Is it single player? I don't do multiplayer really. I guess I'm in the wrong website right now then ;)

I know what you mean about the graphics engine. The thing is I really like the textures used and the architectural styles - I'm not to bothered about photorealism, shadows or ultra-realistic settings. I actually like that almost cartoonishness of Half-Life.

Playing through an industry room full of red containers, dim red lights and the odd spark and flickering thing still works for me.

Plus it runs a dream at 1280 x 1024 with my new 2ghz PC. I think I had Pentium II 233 when it first came out. Shudder.

The only thing is, I wish the monster models were better and more random - more variations in Barneys and scientists would be cool for starters, and I wish they could all be as good as the BlueShift HD gfx - a lot of custom mods obviously don't work with this though.

By the way, I've finished my customised 'Red' Barney -  he sports a nice red helmet and vest with a different logo and personalised ID number, and he is younger looking and has a fetching ginger beard. I even sussed out how to make his voice sound slightly higher and therefore younger. The code seems to run okay too - though for some reason he doesnt attack me when I attack other allies. Not bad though after only 4 or 5 days of learning to mod.

My next trick is to create a new fat completely bald scientist. 

But I'm babbling. I'll go now.

Lol, cool.

And no, Half-Quake: Amen is a singleplayer mod. If www.halfquake.com isn't working, try farm.strikenet.at/index.shtml

I can garuntee you've never played a mod or game like it before.

Yeah, thanks, but I still can't get there though. 

I realise now I already read a review of halfquake - looks fun and funky but I'm not sure, I'll have to download and give it a go won't i?

:)

Yeah, looks like the site is down right now. Hopefully It'll be back up soon.
