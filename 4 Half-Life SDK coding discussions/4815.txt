for players you could try the damage network messages and for monsters, you could record their health in some array, e.g.

why dont you think about your problem a little bit longer, test your ideas and then maybe post the results here ? that would maybe help others too, but until now you just post similar recording question all over here.

hints:

tr->pHit.

classname.

worldspawn, player, monster_something.

You'd need to hook the CBaseMonsters TakeDamage somehow, if you have the SDK for the mod. If not I don't know how to hook it, or if its possible that way. Any other way might not work as well, you could also try catching the 'Damage' net message, but I don't know if that happens on monsters.

I'll be more explicit then...

When a player fires a gunshot, a TraceLine is fired by the engine to determine the impact point of the bullet. So, just hook the TraceLine function when players are holding their fire button down, and read the contents of the TraceResult structure. If the pHit entity is worldspawn, the bullet has hit nothing. If the pHit entity is anything else, then the bullet hit that entity. You can tell then who or what was hit and by whom.
