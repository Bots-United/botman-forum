Hi! I need to craete beam with only start entity defined. So that beam won't have end entitie.
I thought that it will have effect like in making beam in worldcraft (random striking beam), but beams second target exists - (0,0,0)!
How can I make it striking random?

A beam is like a line in 2D space.  You can't have a line with only 1 point.  A beam has as start point and and end point.  There's no such thing as a beam with 1 point.

I know that. But when you specified as "" in env_beams end target in WorldCraft, then env_beam uses   

void      RandomArea( void );

How can I make when CBeam *pBeam::CreateBeam(...
beam which uses RandomArea as second target?

Vector (RANDOM_FLOAT (min_x, max_x), RANDOM_FLOAT (min_y, max_y), RANDOM_FLOAT (min_z, max_z));

... but this is bare bones. You might want to define a smaller area than the whole world, such as the limits of a room.

Also go look at the "env_beam" code in the SDK.  See what Valve is doing there, then do the same thing.
