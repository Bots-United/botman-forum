Subject: Where animi come from

I can see that the animations for reloading and firing for the weapons are set in the 
////Model animations\\\\
enum modelname_e {
model_anim1,
model_anim2,
model_anim3,
model_anim4,
model_anim5,
model_anim6
}
part of the weapon file but I am wondering where it finds these animations?

Liek for example the MP5 from HL as:
enum mp5_e
{
      MP5_LONGIDLE = 0,
      MP5_IDLE1,
      MP5_LAUNCH,
      MP5_RELOAD,
      MP5_DEPLOY,
      MP5_FIRE1,
      MP5_FIRE2,
      MP5_FIRE3,
};

Does it pull these from the MDL file or something?

Thanks again everyone,

Well it seems I've solved my own problem.

The animations are taking from the MDL file.

Now its just figuring out how to peice the animi together for the code :-)

Hey Botman

the tutorial you sent me to at wavelength for weapons show's the

////Model animations\\\\
enum modelname_e {
model_anim1,
model_anim2,
model_anim3,
model_anim4,
model_anim5,
model_anim6
}

the enum modelname_e

is it suppose to be the name of the model or the name of the gun?

The model animation number is stored inside the model when the .qc file is compiled.  These same numbers need to be defined in the code.  For example, if you use 1 for the idle animation, you should use 1 for the idle animation in the code.  If you use 1 for the idle when building the model and use 3 for the idle when building the code, you will not get the correct animations for models (i.e. a player standing still will look like it's running or swimming or jumping, etc.).

Do you know of any good sites with info on coding the animation and explanation of the QC file?

I've looked in a QC file and I can see where it sets the sequences but I'm still confused on the syntax it uses.
Like say I had one like this:
$sequence shoot1 "shoot1" fps 20 { event 5001 0 "11" } 
I know shoot1 is the animi name and "shoot1" is the SMD file refered to, the fps is how many frames per sec and event 5001 calls the muzzleflash but what are the 0 and "11" for?
