How do i go about making a wepon and then adding it to my mp.dll?? i have read a few tut's and cant seem to quite understand them also is there a newbees guide to mod making?? ive read all the FAQ's and tut's i could meaning this: 
1. is there a list of the order a mod should be put together??

 what i mean by this is like a step by step instructoin.. first make the mp.dll then write all your wepon coad then make your client.dll create maps create liblist.gam create sub derectorys comple all your coad run half-life have fun? THIs is just an example if someone could write out a step by step prosece it would help alot!!

by the way wen i write my code for a new wepon wen i add in the moudle part like the V. W. P. moule to the coad are the anomations in the modle or do i haveto coad them too?? if someone could post a coade for an m16 and a place to download the coad for this weppon i could look at the source coad put two and two together and stare on other wepons as well as the m16..

thanx P_Hero

I moved this thread since it was posted in the wrong group.

If you don't know C or C++, the first step is to buy a good book on C or C++ (like "C++ in 21 days", etc.).  Also get a good C++ compiler (there are several free ones available, see my planethalflife.com/botman/Borland.shtmlBorland web page for links to Borland's web site).

Read the planethalflife.com/botman/MOD_FAQ.shtmlMOD FAQ web page.

Follow many of the tutorials on Half-Life coding web sites until you begin to understand how weapons and effects work.

MODs can be developed in any order (maps, models, code, sound, etc.), but usually you will work on all of them at the same time since maps will need stuff in code and the code will need to know things about the models and the code will need to know the names of the sound files and the maps will need to know the names of the world models (like weapons, health, etc.).

You would probably start by making small changes to the code (temporarily using models or maps from elsewhere), then you can begin to create your own maps and models (making changes in the code to reflect the changes in the maps and models), then begin to polish things up by creating your own sounds and textures.

Whatever you do, DON'T just steal models, sounds, maps, textures, etc. from other people's MODs.  The quickest way to prevent people from wanting to play your MOD is to rip off stuff from somewhere else.  Be original and create these things yourself.

If you are planning to make an entire MOD by yourself you will probably find that it is going to take you many, many, many, MANY months.  You will make much more progress if you have 2 or 3 other people helping (one making models, one making maps, one doing textures, sounds and other miscellaneous stuff).

Also, read LOTS of stuff on your own.  There's TONS of good posts on the Wavelength forums (coding, mapping, 2D art, etc.).  Read through a lot of those posts to find answers to questions that you have.  Most of the things you want to know have already been discussed 3 or 4 times in those forums.

Cheesys words of wisdom #2!

By doing the stuff yourself, you'll learn how to do it yourself too!!!
