Take a straight piece of metal and bend it into a curvy sort of shape.  :)

If you are talking about Hooking DLL functions then you should use www.google.com to search for "windows api hooking" or "windows dll hijack" or something similar.

I know about the off-hand grappling hook tutorial, if that's the one you're using.  I'm pretty sure it was written for SDK 1.0 and it may not work properly for SDK 2.0, 2.1 or 2.2.

You should probably try some other tutorials until you are more familiar with the SDK source code, at which point you should be able to modify things on your own and create your own grappling hook code.
