Hi all. Well I was tweaking with the apache code and i was thinking. Would there be a way to make a client command in player.cpp that when it is called will switch entities to the apache ie player to apache i have tried some stuff but no success I have tried the Find_entitie_by_class and i have even tryed to make a use command in the apache that makes it so that when you press use on the apache that you become it no success there either ne one have any help full hints.

void::Apache(void)
{
Link_Entitie_To_Class(NULL,"monster_apache");
}
// this is what i tried basicly make it a command but no duff didnt do ne thing ingame this is kinda wierd im not sure how to swap positions kinda like Rocket-Crowbar ne way hope to hear from some of you's thanx laters.
