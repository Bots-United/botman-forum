Could someone please explain why this crashes my server...

When I change gamemode the server crashes with error :

ScoreInfo - 7 bytes written expected 9

Something like that - I have this happen with other messages also.

I can fix it  by deleteing the message im sending in the new gamemode file but i'd like to know why this does this ?

If I change the size of the messsage to 9 instead of 7 in player.cpp then it crashes right off before I change modes with - expected 9, 7 written...

Thanks

You apparently don't send the network message correctly.
Post the code you're using.
