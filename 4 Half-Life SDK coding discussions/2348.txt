Hello again

Just wondering if you have any experiance with vgui text entry fields. I want to have the user enter some text and then send it to the mp_dll.

char temp[128];
m_pLocalFileBox->getText(0,temp,128);
m_pSendFile->addActionSignal( new CMenuHandler_StringCommand( temp ) );

this doesn't work. for some reason it won't send anything to the mp_dll (temp could be anything but for testing purposes i was using "say hello").

Any ideas?

You might do better to get a response from the Wavelength coding forum (www.planethalflife.com/wavelength), where more people have worked with the VGUI code.  There's not much VGUI coding when working with bots.
