Anyone know of a good place to get more indepth description of the sdk, like which files control what. I am confused about something in the pm_shared.c file and the player.cpp file, why they check for falling in the pm_shared file and play the splat or pain sounds and they check for falling in the player.cpp file and give damage there also. its confusing to try to figure out when i need to edit player.cpp or pm_shared.c .
i also dont understand why PLAYER_FATAL_FALL_SPEED, PLAYER_MAX_SAFE_FALL_SPEED, and the rest of them are defined in player.h at the beginning and then not used anywhere. Then they are defined in pm_shared as well.  one last thing, I am trying to get rid of that stupid sound when you land hard, the one that sounds like a rubber duck when you squeeze it, its called pl_fallpain3.wav, and i have commented out everything that uses it. it is still playing when i land hard. all of my other code is working fine, so i know its recompiling ok.   thanks
