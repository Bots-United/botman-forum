I don't really want to pay $10 so maybe someone could give me this code: I want to make a new command: mp_halflifejump . I want it to do this: sv_gravity 3200 as in player.cpp, i have se the normal gravity setting to 0.25 and I would prefer to make it so people could have the normal jump if the server allowed it.. please give me the code, because I would learn how to do it again.
