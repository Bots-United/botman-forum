I tried the search for about 1/2 hour and then gave up!

Is there a sure way to tell when the level has been changed (new map is loading) in CS only?

I would prefer to not use the timer method.
Thanks.

Try ServerActivate or ServerDeactivate, if I remember correctly those should happen around a mapchange.

In CounterStrike :

Map change :
   ServerDeactivate()/ServerActivate();

Round change
   FindEntityByString("info_map_parameters");

Yeah although I'm not sure if gpGlobals->mapname will update on ServerActivate.. you'll have to check for your self

There's all sorts of weird methods you can use.

You can hook onto pfnSpawn(edict_t* pent), then check for STRING(pent->v.classname) == "worldspawn", the spawning of the worldspawn entity indicates a map is loading.

You can check for the start of the first round by hooking onto pfnFindEntityByString and if the entity found is "info_map_parameters" then that indicates the round has just started.

You cam also count each frame, and using boolean flags which detect the worldspawn and roundstart events, you can figure out the first frame of the roundstart or first frame of new map load, etc.

Almost forgot, there's also pfnChangeLevel that you can hook onto. It gets called whenever a map ends and the next map is about to load.
