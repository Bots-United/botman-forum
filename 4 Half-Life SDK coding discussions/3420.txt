Do I need to add any files before I compile the client.dll? Everything is by default.

No, you just compile it :)

OK, thanks! Just asking because when I compiled it, it has about 345kb. But valve's client.dll has about 540kb.

Maybe the debug stuff is included in Valve's DLL ? I can't think of another reason ???

If you build the client.dll without any VGUI stuff (using MinGW or Borland), the client.dll file will be MUCH smaller than the valve\cl_dlls\client.dll file.

You CAN'T compile the VGUI stuff using anything other than the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.  VGUI was written using MSVC and you HAVE to have the Microsoft compiler to do anything with VGUI.

If you are using Borland or MinGW, you will have to settle for a client DLL with no VGUI components.
