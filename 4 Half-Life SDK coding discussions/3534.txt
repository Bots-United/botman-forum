i readed a tut (http://hlpp.telefragged.com/tuts/grpack1.htm)
about teamplaying. now when i compile the whole thing i got an pointer error (i think).

F:\Project\source\Source Code\dlls\player.cpp(2667) : error C2039: 'm_szTeamName' : is not a member of 'CBaseEntity'
        F:\Project\source\Source Code\dlls\cbase.h(136) : see declaration of 'CBaseEntity'

now i am really bad @ pointer so i just want to ask if someone can help me out. it all looks good (pointed the prob with "->" whitout the quotes)in this routine but there still a prob. maybe some can help me out ? would be really cool ! tnx.

You have this...

case 0: szTempNextTeam = pPlayer->m_szTeamName

...was it supposed to be this...

case 0: szTempNextTeam = pBPlayer->m_szTeamName

???

pPlayer is a bad choice of a variable name.  It should have been something like pEntity to keep it from getting confused with pBPlayer.

hmmmm works, but when you join you will get automatacli join the team with the fewest players (good). but you only get an hud and no weapons :s
and auto join crashes back to the desktop :S
confusing...
