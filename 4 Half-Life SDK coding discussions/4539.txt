As some of you may know, I have been working on a TFC clone, named RTF, or Team Fortress R, this is a very close emulation of Valves TFC MOD, only for people interested in modifying it, I'm willing to pass on the server DLL code. As many people are into "modding" TFC, RTF might be a good way for those people to expand on what they are doing, by actually changing the code within the mod, rather than be restricted to a hook type DLL.

If you want to try out RTF, you can download it from the link below:

If you are interested in running a server and getting the server code, email me at rob@planetfortress.com

I would be interested in knowing the compatibility levels between TFC and RTF.

Can a RTF client connect and play on a TFC server ?
Can a TFC client connect and play on a RTC server ?
What are the limitations ?

If you managed to get a nearly perfect emulation, then it would be awesome!

No, the TFC client DLL is not compatible with the RTF server DLL, the main reason for this is that the weapons code has had to be completley rewritten, as (obviously) the original TFC code is not available, this would take more time and effort than is worth it to get working with the TFC client DLL.

Having a self build client DLL is advantageous in many ways, for example, if someone wants to know how something is done on the client, or wishes me to implement some custom routines (providing they are resonable). I will do my best to help, this allows even further flexibility with the development of peoples MODs, so you could give me some client code to put into the RTF client DLL, I do so, so when the next version of the MOD comes out, anyone with RTF can join a server running your server DLL and your features will be accessible.

Theres nothing to stop you trying to get the RTF Server DLL to work with the original TFC DLL if you wanted to give it a try.

So basically, no, the client code between the two MODs is not compatible. Its possible you could get the RTF server DLL working with the TFC client DLL, but it would be quite difficult, its completley impossible to allow an RTF client DLL to be used on a normal TFC server, as the HLEngine will see the differences between the client DLL on the server and the one on the client.

Im not sure waht you mean when you say "What are the limitations?", I might have covered this question above.

btw, if you try the RTF Beta, use the command "gp_special" to access the spies NV or the scouts radar, these are proof of concept ideas, just things that are not possible using normal TFC.

hehe OK, I was dreaming perhaps... :)

But in the end it's still a big piece of work you made here, kudos!
