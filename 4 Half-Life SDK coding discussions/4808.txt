First, thank Botman for his source code.

I added Botman's "Bot Number 10" code to the HL Full SDK v2.3. It works very well. However, there is still a problem. When I add more than 1 bot, I open the scoreboard and click any one of the bot's names, all the bot's icons in the "Voice" column will change. So I want to ask how I can resolve this problem.

Thanks.

that's because the all have the same ID (an invalid player id) Why'd you want to mute a bot anyway eh ? It doen't talk :D

Anyway I don't think you can fix it...

You can hook pfnGetPlayerWONId() to make the bots return an unique WONId, that you will specify in some config file, or else auto-generated ones, if that's your problem.
