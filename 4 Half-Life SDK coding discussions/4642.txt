maybe you just pick some original halflife sound which doesnt cause this message and look at which frequency and number of bits it is recorded. I think it was something like 8192 samples/sec and 8 bit ... dunno, just look at those files and see. then you only have to convert this warning causing file to this format.

anyway, is this really pulling down the performance ? I doubt it, it may be some .1fps or somthing, but not much

I believe anything other than 11Khz or 22Khz will give that warning.

Load the .wav file into a sound editing program (like CoolEdit or Goldwave) and resample the sound at 11Khz or 22Khz and save the .wav file back to disk.  Then Half-Life shouldn't give you that warning.
