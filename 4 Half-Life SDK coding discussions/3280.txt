hi all!

noob to hl programming, hope you can help me out.

i want to write a "general plugin" for hl, a remote control for winamp. the first step should be to control it using cvars, later i will implement a vgui menu.

as this isn't really a mod and should be completely on the client side i'm quite stuck. is there a way to get dlls loaded for all mods? if not then i expect i have to place a dll in front of the mod dll, right? hop this doesn't violate the cheat detection of half-life.

hope you can give me a good place to start,
tom

The Half-Life engine won't let you load custom apps clientside that interface directly with Half-Life.  This is how all the client side cheats work and Valve is trying to prevent that.  The only non-cheat method of providing clientside features is to create your own client.dll file while MUST be the same client.dll file that is running on the server.  This means that you must create your own MOD since you can't rebuild the client.dll from other MODs since you don't have the source code.

hey thanx for your quick reply!

too bad it won't work this way. so no vgui menues :(

so unless i don't find a way to read and write from/to the hl console from external apps i guess my project will have stopped before it even has started :(

Well uhm, you should search on google for the nemesis hook, it uses cheat methods to implement non-cheat stuff in tfc (flag timer, winamp control, ...)
I don't know if it still works in the latest version though...
