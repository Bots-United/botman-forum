I'm a new member of this community (or at least I hope to be) but i'm
not a new programmer, only to HL.

I usually ask others as a last resort, and after reading every HL
tutorial and searched many forums I still havn't found the answer.. as a
matter of fact, only a single mention of what i'm trying to do.

The question is: I'm trying to make players walk on
walls and rotate their view angle. Before I explain the problem, if you
know someone that did the same please tell me about him. 

The walk part I managed to do, but when they are on the wall they
should look at it as there floor - rotating the entrie view point.
Meaning that if you walk on the ceiling, you will see everything up side
down.
After tweaking both input32 and view.cpp codes on the client side, I
managed to remove the pitch limit and roll the view. While roll is set
to 90/270 deg, and the pitch becomes X movement, the change in YAW
doesn't change Y but rotate the view port so when Pitch is set to 90,
You can't look up or down in every way.
I think the problem is withing the engine, since it rotates the view on the same axis even if I rotate it. Or maybe there is another way to do what I want.

The problem is a bit hard to explain, but if anyone managed to do so please tell me how. This is not a theoretical problem, so if you don't know the answer it won't help me.
