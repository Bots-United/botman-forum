I'm a begining c++ student. In order for me to learn better I have to keep it interesting. What better way than to learn how to make a mod, right?
COOL, so I'm not like tring to steal, just learn. Now that that is settled. I'm a HUGE CS fan! I want to (attempt) to make a HL mod (I was thinking like a co-op Counter-strike/ResedentEvil/Sven type thing). One problem. If I want it to be alot like CS can I use the CS code? Is their a open source CS code download or anything like that? Anything even close? I need some kind of a good reference to go by. 
P.S. IF not couldn't I just use a few of the CS files in my own mod or would it just be an exact copy of the CS game (without any way to customize any gameplay or add monsters)?

For Counter-Strike copyright related questions, you should ask directly Gooseman and Cliffe (the authors of Counter-Strike). I doubt you will find the Counter-Strike source code anywhere. This MOD is not Open Source. There are a few MODs that are Open Source, but I don't remember which. Anyhow with Valve's full SDK you get the complete source code for the Deathmatch Classic MOD, so you can use it for a start, or at least learn from it.

Good luck

Oz Deathmatch version 1.7
It is an older version though, that is not compatible with the newest Half-Life update.
