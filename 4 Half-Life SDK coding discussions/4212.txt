I cant seem to find an answer to this and i'm not sure if regular HL servers have this problem. And I cant find the answer from searching the SDK unless its in the client side code.

In DMC if a server is run in teamplay mode the players FOV is locked at 90.

Where would the code be to make teamplay servers run so its not locked ? 

Thanks

If you are talking about the "fov" field of the entvars_t variable of an entity (pEdict->v.fov), the code who sets it is client side. You can monitor it server side, that's what I did with the plugin for POD-bot I made that makes the bots use the scopes of their guns (by pressing the IN_ATTACK2 button enough time needed to reach the desired v.fov value), but setting this field to an arbitrary value by yourself won't make the player change his FOV width - unless the MOD code relies explicitly on this value for adapting the width of the field of view in realtime, but for what I've seem, it's rather the contrary: the MOD decides of the FOV, then sets the v.fov value as an indicator, but that's all.
