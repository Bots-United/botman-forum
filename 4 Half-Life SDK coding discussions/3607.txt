The tutorial is the ReadMe in my Monster plugin.  That's how to spawn monsters.

If you are asking for a tutorial on how to write code to allow you to spawn monsters, the tutorial is the source code to my monster plugin.  If you don't understand the source code and what it's doing, then you probably shouldn't be fooling around with something like this anyway.

It's not so simple that I can make a tutorial for it.  If you just want the snark and nothing else, remove all of the other monsters from the Monster plugin and just use that.

If you want to add a new monster, you will HAVE to understand what's being done in the Monster plugin source code.  There's no other way.

Since you are new to C++ and Half-Life coding, I would STRONGLY recommend that you start with much more simple tutorials.  Look at my "MOD FAQ" page for links to Half-Life coding tutorial websites that have some simple Half-Life tutorials.  Once you have worked with the Half-Life SDK and C++ for many months then you will begin to understand how the Half-Life code works.  Once you have worked with it for 6 months or more, you will probably begin to understand what I have done in the Monster plugin source code.

If you're not willing to spend 3 to 6 months learning the Half-Life SDK, then I don't think you will be able to do what you are trying to do.
