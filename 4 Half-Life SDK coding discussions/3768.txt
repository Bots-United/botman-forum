It may be possible to compile it with BCC, provided minor modifications (botman made a patch for stripping the VGUI stuff that doesn't compile right if not by Microsoft's CL). Search down through his pages, he must have published it somewhere.

If you download SDK 2.2 and run my SDK 2.2 patches on the source code, the resulting client source code files can be compiled with the Borland command line compiler or the MinGW compiler.

See my "Building the SDK" webpage, download the patches and read the enclosed ReadMe.txt file...

The only thing you can't do in the client is used any VGUI code.  This includes the VGUI menus (for selecting teams, classes, weapons, etc.), the VGUI observer mode tutorials, and things like the VGUI scoreboard.  I replaced the VGUI scoreboard with the old "text style" scoreboard from the SDK 1.0 source code.
