Hey..

I want to set make a player unable to attack. I've tried everything except the right thing..

I've trried setting their buttons to 0. I've tried setting their weapons to 0, I've tried issuing client commands with "-attack" but they just never work.

Has anyone every got this to work.. or tell me how I can just remove all the players weapons / set the current weapon to one they cant use ... just so they cant shoot.?!!?

That's such a coincidence, I was wondering exactly the same thing at this very moment :D

For stripping a player's weapons, I know how to use the player_weaponstrip entity, but the drawback is that it seems it HAS to be triggered by a trigger_multiple located somewhere on the map, that the player would activate only when he passes through. I have tried to force it to be triggered, by calling DispatchUse() and DispatchTouch() onto that trigger_multiple, no way ! The only way it works seems to be the "normal" way, i.e. the player has to ACTUALLY touch the trigger_multiple :(

...and btw, forcing pev->button to 0 everywhere does not work anyhow ! ???

Create a new weapon which does nothing when the player attacks.  In the new weapon's CanHolster function, return FALSE unless your conditions to allow attacks again are met.

Or add a check to each weapon's primary and secondary attack functions to return without doing anything if a flag to disallow attacks is set

Jim, I guess you assume I have the source for the MOD... but the fact is it is for CS ! And all CBasePlayer/Entity stuff is different (It just crashes when you trry accessing CBase stuff within CS with normal SDK cBase stuff... :/ That makes it all the more difficult :(

yep, the same for me. What are you trying to achieve Cheesy ? For me, it's about my own sausage of the Chicken-mod (turn players into chickens for punishing TKs) ; I don't like the original Chicken-mod so I am trying to do my own.

I'm wanting to make a weapon plug-in.. and restrict weapons by disallowing the user to shoot the a disallowed weapon. At the moment I've made people drop weapons when they pick up a disallowed weapon, but sometimes it can overflow the player when you hold in attack and try to pickup a weapon like a para machine gun :(. I guess I could make it just goto the knife weapon and set weapons value to just the knife. Because eventually I want this plugin on some knife only servers or such like :)

Actually the only thing I know, is that when I set their pev->weapons bitmask to zero at each frame, they haven't the possibility to switch weapons anymore. But they still can shoot, and that's a gore awful hack, not the right way to do.

Does anyone have a clue ?

um, well i know hwo to take all the players weapons away except crowbar in tfc... i guess if you took ALL of there weapons away that would work, (a long with rmembvering there class so you can give them back when done). Its aloud with maping too, check out matclub by phatmat from the sillyzone.

no dale, he says he CAN take away the weapons, but he just wants them to keep the weapons, but not be able to shoot them

So no genius in here has some blazing idea on how to force or restrict a client to press a key ?

I'm gonna have a look (again) in the DMC client DLL source code. Any idea, else ??

well, i do, but it wouldnt be that great, considering if they shot it would kick them.
