I'm making a DLL file to make lower pings and better features in servers and I need some help. Mostly I'm just going to be putting CVars in this dll. 
I want to make the server execute commands so how would I do that in a .h / .cpp file. And then I want a console message that displays a message. I think the code is CLIENT_PRINTF( pPlayer->edict(), print_console, UTIL_VarArgs("%s\n",sText)) but could you double check me. Then lastly I need to know what metamod source files i need to combine with my dll to make them work together. 

Thanks Alot

There are several examples of metamod plugins available in the metamod source code download.  Take a look at the stub or trace plugin as a simple example.
