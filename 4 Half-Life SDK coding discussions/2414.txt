2)How can I use seweral sprites on one entitie (or models)

1. The origin field of the pev structure contains the current location in 3D space (i.e. pev->origin = X,Y,Z coordinate).

2. I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Explain what you are trying to do.

For example nukebomb from OpFor is one entitie, but it has three models: case, rocket and detonator. All that is made together in one entitie. How can I do that?

This is a model thing.  You can have different bodies within the same model.  Take a look at how the human grunt model has different heads.

I think pev->body is used to select from the available model submodels.
