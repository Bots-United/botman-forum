I was changing the custom build to compile it into my mod directory. For Project settings -custom build - Outputs, do I put the name of the file? Like hl.dll?

I would leave the default location for the executable alone, and under custom build, for hl.dll, put "copy .\debughl\hl.dll <your mod path>\dlls\hl.dll" and for client.dll, use "copy .\Debug\client.dll <your mod path>\cl_dll\client.dll"  This way you just copy the dlls automatically whenever you do a build.  Note you'll have to modify that if you've changed the default directories for the output files.
