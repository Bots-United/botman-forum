Try setting their pev->netname to MAKE_STRING ("whatevername"), but I don't know if your clients will update that new name by their side.

thats a tough one, but in admin mod, if you use execlient to change someons name and 'admin_quiet' is set to 0, doesn't it not say anything? If i'm wrong sorry for bothering.
