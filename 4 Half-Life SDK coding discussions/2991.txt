I don't understand it much either.

You have to read over the SDK (or thats atleast what I do) get a understanding of it...

I'm sure some one else can help you.

Hmm I take it you've been to Girl power 2 or SillyZone or a another server that has entity movers...

You cannot have the TFC source code cause Valve never released it...

Create a meta mod dll or one from scratch that sits between the tfc.dll and the game engine.

I'm probably not making much sense because I don't know this stuff that much either.

Also do you know C or C++ ?

If you don't buy a book on it. Its way to hard to program if you don't know the language...

Metamod would be the best place to start if you want to try making your own plugin for a MOD.  My Stripper2 source code will show you how to spawn entities.  There are examples on this forum of cloning brush models.

If you don't know C or C++, LEARN THAT FIRST, then download the Half-Life SDK and follow some of the tutorials on the sites mentioned in my MOD FAQ web page so that you understand how stuff in the SDK works (you can't change things if you don't understand how they work).  Look through some of the Metamod examples that comes with the Metamod source code to see how to create your own plugin.

If you are going to be doing anything with the Half-Life SDK, you will need to understand C++, so you might as well learn it (and you'll learn C in the process).

Yes, the MSVC C++ compiler will compile C code (any C++ compiler will compile C code).
