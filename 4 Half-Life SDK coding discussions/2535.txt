Alrighty...  I have asked this question on about 3 different boards (Wavelength, HLSDK, Valve ERC), a mailing list (HL Coders), and talked to numerous amounts of people about it, and have not found an answer.  Now I turn to you guys.

"Invalid Function Pointer,"  that is found in util.cpp, CSave::WriteFunction( const char *pname, const int *data, int count ).  Heres the problem.  When I am ingame and I save, my console is flooded with the message, and a bunch of "Can't Find Address: blahblah."  When I load a lot of things in the level arn't saved, monsters and what they are doing (they just go into freeze frame type of deal), all the properties of weapons (m_pPlayer, m_iClipsize, etc.) and some other entities like trigger_multiples and trigger_onces don't save their properties.  If you want more detail about the error then just reply.  This error isn't nice, and if I can't fix it I may have to recode my entire mod...

People.. please help.

Are you refering to that?  Thats my mod team, although ingame I go as [KOBK]Ghoul I think clans are a waste of talent.  I have [KOBK] infront of my name to represent that I am a KOBK Dev member.  Good day.

After some contact with Valve themselfs I have found out that my save "function" is f'ed.  When I compile a debug version of the .dll it reports what functions that should have EXPORT in front of them don't have it.  Turns out it says EVERY function that deals with Thinking, Touching, Using, or Blocking.  I am thinking about installing a fresh SDK and then transfering all the files I know have nothing to do with saving.  Then modifying the main ones, like cbase.h, cbase.cpp, and util.cpp to have the things I need that won't give me unidentified errors and whatnot.  If anyone wants to give me an input feel free.  See ya all.

Well, I solved it.  Turns out you bots were causing the problem, when the bot .dll is loaded in SP the game can't find the functions.  The only thing I have to do now is just rename the 2 different .lib files depending on whether the user wants to use bots.  botman, do you know why the bots cause this, and a way around it?  It doesn't matter all that much, it just saves time.  Thanks for the "help" everyone.

"do you know why the bots cause this, and a way around it?"

Nope.  The single player game used to work fine with the HPB bot using the Half-Life 1.0.1.6 engine.  When Valve updated to the 1.1.0.0 engine something else also changed in the SDK 2.0 that caused the HPB bot code to no longer be compatible with single player games.

If you try to start the single player version of Half-Life with the HPB bot loaded, it will get to the end of the train ride at the start, but Barney will never get triggered to come let you out of the train.  There's no fix for this that I've found.  The solution is to uninstall the HPB bot if you want to play single player games, then reinstall it when you want to play deathmatch games against the bots.
