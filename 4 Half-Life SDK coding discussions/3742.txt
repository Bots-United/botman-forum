not sure if this is a good place to ask, but i figure you're all tfc related developers and might have a clue as irc is pretty rampant in this community...

i've been working on an irc script that lets me monitor multiple tfc servers.  i'm fairly new to both irc scripting and tfc server log monitoring, but have managed to have quite a bit of success recently... basically, i have used the rcon logaddress function to route logging to my irc client where i have a udp socket monitoring for the info and i parse as i get.

the problem is i don't seem to get ALL log messages that go to the hard file.  in particular i've noticed i almost never get the player disconnect logs...  i thought maybe quite a few messages might appear at this time and "spam out" my socket?

bleh, i really dunno what to think or where to start looking further.... any help/pointing fingers of where i really should go is 100% appreciated!

thx.
