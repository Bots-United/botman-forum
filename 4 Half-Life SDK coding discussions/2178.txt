How can I get the distance between 2 entities? Its probably a stupid question but I can't wokr it out. Also is there any special conditions needed for an entity to be able to collide with the player?

If you have pointers to 2 edicts you can do it like this...
code:
float distance;

distance = (pEdict1->v.origin - pEdict2->v.origin).Length();

The entities must be SOLID for the engine to detect collisions.  Also the size of the object must be set correctly (I think the default size is 1 cubic unit).

Look at the "SOLID_" types in common\const.h for some examples of solid entities types.  Also I just noticed the comments in const.h which says that some movetypes will cause collisions regardless of the solid setting (it doesn't say which ones do though).  You'll probably have to find out by trial and error.

aah I was doing that, now I realise why it wasnt working. I had;

if((pEdict1->v.origin - pEdict2->v.origin).Length() < 5.0)

When I made it dump me some figures of the scenario, 5.0 was a ridiculously low value, therefore never came to true.
