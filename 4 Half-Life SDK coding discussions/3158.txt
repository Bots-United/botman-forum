I noticed on the CS Beerforbreakfast servers you can see the names/health/and percentage of damage with different weapons for people when you put your crosshair over them. Is that a Metamod plugin or what? 

Also, I cant add my own source code to the medamod.dll unless I recompile it right?

You don't modify the metamod.dll itself.  You create a metamod plugin that metamod will load and execute on the server.
