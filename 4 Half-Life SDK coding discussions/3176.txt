Hi! I understand almost everything in making entities for half-life, but can you explain what NEXTTHINK does? I know it is something like "timer", but what is it?

It sets the next time the entity's Think() function will be called. More precisely, it sets the date under which the entity's Think() function should NOT be called (since in normal operation it is called every frame).

To be a little more clear, you set up a Think() function for an entity using SetThink().  You set the nextthink time to be the time when you want that Think() function called.  If you want the Think() function to be called 7.2 seconds from now you would set nextthink to gpGlobals->time + 7.2.
