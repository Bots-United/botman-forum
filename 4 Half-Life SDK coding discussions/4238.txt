Hello all,

teehee 2 in one night, I am deperate.

I am creating a MOD and have followed this tutorial:

users.pandora.be/dekoffie/teamvgui.htmlhttp://users.pandora.be/dekoffie/teamvgui.html

I followed that tutorial line by line. Now when i try and run the map i create with each entity in it, the Map goes in, i Select a team, it says "Phreak has joined Team1" and then it does nothing.

In the console however, it says "no spawn points in level<1>Phreak128937127843<1>490". BUT I ADDED info_team1,info_team2,info_player_start,info_player_deathmatch,info_teamplaydetect!!!!

(Numbers arent correct, but it is something of that nature)

Anyone able to help? Is it map error or coding error?

Any help would be gratly appreciated

Phreak
