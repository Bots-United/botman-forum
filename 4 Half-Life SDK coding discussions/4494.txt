Hello

This question is primarily directed to those who already know or know where to get the info, about the changes Gearbox Software made in the HL engine with the release of Blue Shift.

I am interested in viewing/editing some of the material of this HL MOD, especially some maps. Unfortunately there seems to have been significant changes with the HL engine, so much that the BSP format at least is not the same. (not counting that the engine and DLL function tables are not the same either and thus it is impossible to make Blue Shift run like a standard MOD).

Do you know where I can find information about the Blue Shift map format ? I'd adapt the BSP tools source code then to fit my needs.

So far I've found that lumps have not the same size. I guess the max sizes may have been raised. Is there some documentation/reference material somewhere on the net ?

There is no public information on the Blue Shift map changes.  Gearbox typically doesn't release proprietary changes to the games they create.

Blue Shift maps require the Blue Shift engine and the Blue Shift engine does not support multiplayer (only single player).

About the only thing you can do MOD wise with Blue Shift is to create new maps for it.  I believe Gearbox released and SDK with compile tools and the .fgd file (but I could be wrong).

Too bad then. I could try to figure the changes out by myself but I'm not sure it's worth the work. I give up, but thanks anyway.
