How detections does player run whether it goes (whether pressed key of run whether not)?

Are you asking how the code knows if the player should RUN or WALK?

For Half-Life deathmatch (other MODs may be different), the client sends "+speed" when the walk key is held down and it sends "-speed" when the walk key is let up.

In ClientCommand() you can catch the "+speed" or "-speed" commands and set a flag to indicate that the player should be walking now or should be running now.

Isn't it also catchable by the IN_RUN flag set in the button field of the player's entvars ?

code:

// is this player walking ?
if (pPlayerEdict->v.flags & IN_RUN)
   ; // yes, it is
else
   ; // no, it is not



Not tested though, but it seems logical.

I put this in player.cpp ?

void CBasePlayer :: UpdateClientData( void )
{
if (pPlayerEdict->v.flags & IN_RUN)
ALERT(at_console,"Player run...");

and display me errors at compilation.

Understand what you are writing before writing it, man.

pPlayerEdict is a variable name. I named it explicitly so you should know :
- what TYPE of variable it is
- what it is supposed to HOLD
Just write the necessary code to declare that variable and link it to what it should hold.
