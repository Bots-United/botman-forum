i was just wondring how i would go about getting player info, like their nick, in cbase.cpp of the mp dll. is there an easy way? is it possible? 

Basically, what i'm trying to do is send a message when someone is hit by a weapon so that the player who did the hitting knows who they hit. 

This means i need to send a message back to the player who did the hitting, and i'm not sure how to do this....can anyone help?

Thanks Q

edict_t *pPlayer;

STRING (pPlayer->v.netname)


or


CBasePlayer *pPlayer;

STRING (pev->netname);
