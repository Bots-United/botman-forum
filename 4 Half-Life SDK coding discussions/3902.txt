because i couldnt get a proper handle on the engine's viewmodel i wrote my own by bastardising various bits of code, mainly the StudioModelRendererer. the problem i have now is that my view model dissapears into walls (cos its bigger than the player is) ... 

StudioFxTransform( cl_entity_t *ent, float transform[3][4] )


this gives me an ent and a transform matrix. only the vectors in there dont appear to be orthogonal, vector 4 appears to be the positioning (from 0,0,0) vector  but the other three change wierdly as you rotate and are different for different view models (presumably they relate to i"internal" axes in the viewmodel?)

anyone here know how to scale them orthogonally?


my only other option is to z hack the viewmodel, which i believe the engine's vmodel does. only i've no idea how to do that!
