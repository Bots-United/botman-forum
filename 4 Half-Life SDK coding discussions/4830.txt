hi all
valve is going to bring down the won-servers as soon as steam works without problems. as i don't like cs1.6 i would love to play cs1.5 even when won.net is down. may there be a chance to emulate the won-servers and if there is, how is won authentication done?

any ideas?

thx in advance

If someone knew how to do this, they would have bypassed WON years ago and people wouldn't have to "steal" other people's CD keys to play on-line.

I doubt anyone will be able to bypass the encryption currently used to authenticate with a WON server.

You'll probably need to get used to CS 1.6, just play LAN games, or move on to another game.  ;)

hm... but i remember that ogc published a list with inet-servers wich did not need a valid cd-key to play an them for cheat testing or so... did they simply crack the server to skip communication with won?

and i found a tool called "lan_fw" (acts like a proxy i think - could not find any further information about it) wich is makes it possible to play old cs betas using the outdated won protocol... by looking at the config they seem to use their own masterservers...

Start a server with "-nomaster" on the command line would that do it?

e.g. hlds.exe -game cstrike -nomaster

i fear it won't. -nomaster disables the communication with the masterserver, not the won authentication. and using +sv_lan 1 prevents clients outside the lan from connecting as fas as i know.

IP masquerading ?

Perhaps they use a network bottleneck to divet all traffic between their networks and the outside world, then watch the packets sent between their PCs and WON.net? Since to my knowledge, all the authentication is done serverside, once you figure out what the WON "accepted" message looks like, you just need to configure a router to redirect all traffic intended for WON to a system that automatically sends the WON accept message. Of course if WON used a non-connectionless protocol (which would bog them down immensely) or encryption (which wouldn't) then you'd have big problems trying to do that.

I suspect they're using the Blowfish encryption (where did I hear that from, again ?)... hard time to decypher.

I don't know if the WON authentication is using the same Blowfish encryption that the Half-Life client/server connection uses.

I've never really looked at the network traffic that goes back and forth between a server and WON when a player attempts to connect.  It might not be encrypted (but I kinda doubt that).  My understanding is that when a player connects to a server, the server sends a request to WON to authenticate the player's WON ID.  I believe that this happens on a different port number than the standard 27015 that's used to communicate between client and server.  You'd have to use a network sniffer or a proxy agent to capture the network packets and take a look at this yourself to know for sure.
