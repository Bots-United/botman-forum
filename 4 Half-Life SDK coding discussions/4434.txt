Does anyone know where the code is that determines the physical height of the player ? Like 76 units or whatever it is..

Thanks

The util.h file has this...

code:
#define VEC_HULL_MIN            Vector(-16, -16, -36)
#define VEC_HULL_MAX            Vector( 16,  16,  36)
#define VEC_HUMAN_HULL_MIN      Vector( -16, -16, 0 )
#define VEC_HUMAN_HULL_MAX      Vector( 16, 16, 72 )
#define VEC_HUMAN_HULL_DUCK     Vector( 16, 16, 36 )

#define VEC_VIEW                Vector( 0, 0, 28 )

#define VEC_DUCK_HULL_MIN       Vector(-16, -16, -18 )
#define VEC_DUCK_HULL_MAX       Vector( 16,  16,  18)
#define VEC_DUCK_VIEW           Vector( 0, 0, 12 )

...which is used by player.cpp to set the height of the player.

Be aware that not all MODs share these values. In Counter-Strike, for example, the player hull is not as tall (I think it's 56 high but this needs to be confirmed).

Other MODs such as HL Rally completely shrink all the hulls to have larger maps. If the MOD you're working with uses the unmodified util.h file from the HL SDK, then you can safely assume these values are right.

I have a metamod plugin that displays useful infos about entities, and draws their bounding boxes. You can get it from my site, downloads section; it's called PMTools. Basically, to know a player's dimensions, substract the entity's absmin to its absmax, and you'll get the vector size of its bounding box. Since bounding boxes are always axial, you can then use the z value to know a player's height.

Ok, Thanks very much Pierre.

I'm working with DMC code. I'm trying to make a "pro" mod of DMC - Make it closer to Quake than Valve did.

The player model in Quake feels shorter than in DMC, thought i'd shorten him a bit. I have lowered the FOV of the player and it feels just like Quake but the hull is still default height so players still bump their heads in places they shouldn't compared to original Quake.

Has anyone ever worked with VGUI menus in DMC ?

For some reason ALOT of VGUI code has been commented out, ex. vgui_viewport is only in DMC and alot of the menu functions are commented out unlike it's brother teamfortressviewport. 

Alot of code dealing with team fortress stuff is commented out or missing..

Maybe Valve did not want someone to code a TF mod for DMC replacing their own TFC...Who knows.

If anyone knows of anyone that has gotten VGUI menus to work in DMC let me know..

Thanks

One more question : 

The code that shows the FPS (cl_fps 1 or 0) is part of unreleased network code ?

I was wanting to use that code as a jump point to make something that would show the players movement speed.

The FPS display is part of the engine code and you don't have access to it.

You might want to take a look at the code in the client that displays text messages (the "say" and "say_team" stuff) and use something similar to that to display textual messages.

Ok, Thats a good idea. Thanks Botman

BTW - I finally got VGUI to display

You can get the height size of any player, while crouching its smaller etc..

from:

pPlayer->v.size.z
