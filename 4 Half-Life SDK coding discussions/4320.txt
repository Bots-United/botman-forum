When I set a new origin for a ammo create to move it to a new location. The trigger remains in the old spot.

Problem 1. How do I move the trigger with the ammo create?

Problem 2. Remove the trigger altogether?

p.s I'm talking about moving the entity on the map during the game, I know how to change origin, but not the trigger(touch) location.

Did you call UTIL_SetOrigin() after changing the origin of the entity to let the engine know that it has moved?

Thanks Botman! :o)

I checked out the procedure and it called SET_ORIGIN();

Whereas UTIL_SetOrigin() wouldn't let me pass in the values I wanted. Anyway, point being your post took me to where I needed to be. Thanks again.

Just for my own information, how were you setting the entity origin *before* ?
There are several methods I know and I would be interested in knowing which one has the effects you mentioned.

Probably...
code:

pev->origin.X = x_value;
pev->origin.Y = y_value;
pev->origin.Z = z_value;

This doesn't update the engine's collision structures.
