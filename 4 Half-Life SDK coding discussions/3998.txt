Hello

I would like to know, what is the maximum number of usermsgs a game DLL can register ?

I am building a structure to keep track of usermsgs names together with their ids and size, for portability reasons, ala metamod. That's why I need to know the max number of messages that can be registered in order to size my array well.

I am not at all certain, but by the looks of things youd be safe with the number of size byte (255 max) by looking at botman's debug_engine output of user messages I would think.. 

Failing that you could also go with a linked list + hash table maybe instead of an array of course!

Yes, I would think a byte is fine.  I seem to remember seeing a READ_BYTE() in the function that determines which network message is being sent before dispatching it in the client.

I'll dig through the engine source and see if I can confirm this.
