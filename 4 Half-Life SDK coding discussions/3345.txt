I'm making a mod (I'm trying to do something with this) and I added new weapon based on hl_glock.cpp code (no modification of this).   Compilation is ok, there isn't any errors or warnigs. When I run the game my weapon is in the right position in hud, there is a model of this weapon but there aren't any animation of shoting, reloading etc. Weapon is shooting and killing monsters but there's no sound of shoot, decal on the walls. What's wrong ? I'm new here and I want to say HELLO everybody.

well, somewhere in the beginning is something with enum and then alot of stuff inside of it
there go the weapon animations, you may give them you own name, as long as you follow the order of the model you have (look the animations up in modelviewer)
about the sound, well you have probably done something wrong in the primary_attack function causing you not to make any noise. (also check if u haven't done any wrong precaching for the sounds)

Well, this "should" solve your problems, but if it doesn't, feel free to ask here again.

Precaching of sounds is ok. I copied and pasted the glock's code. And I'm not changed the model of weapon (orginal glock).

Are ya trying to copy the glock bcause ya want another weapon like it or are ya copying it to see if ya can code new weapons, if ya doin it for the sake of making an new weapon, try doing this tut,
