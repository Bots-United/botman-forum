(I hope this is the right board)

I am currently developing the E[POD]bot, a bot for counter-Strike. I think you all know the principe how this works, so I will not repeat it here.

I got the idea to make localized versions of the bot, but not only localize the readme files, botchat and comments in cfgs, but also the onscreen messages. 

it would be hard to update a bot which is present in different languages, so I thought of having the strings for the onscreen messages in an external file. The bot dll should read this file and use the strings at once.

I could figure out myself, but I'm not that keen in C++, the bot is my first big project and I have also to fit the needs of the HL engine. so I ask you if you know a smart and/or easy way. or if you have some advice for me.

It would be also good, if this file was encrypted or encoded in some way, so that it is not possible to mess this up. or even intentionally insert stupid stings ;)

Just put the strings in a text file and read them in when the game starts (similar to how you would read in a file of bot names).

You have have different extensions on the file for different language and have an option in the bot .cfg for which one the user wants to load.

My old relic that happens to call itself 'RACC preview' makes bot display chat strings in different languages, given the 'nationality' of the bot. These strings are read from different text files when the game starts. You might want to have a look at the source code...

and what about the encryption? how would you do this. I don't want users to mess my bot up.

Why would you want to encrypt it (other than it would mess it up..) i.e. what are you storing in these strings? And why wouldn't it be nice to allow users to edit them?
