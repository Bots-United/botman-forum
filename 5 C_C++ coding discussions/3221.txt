learning C++ i need to compile stuff to see if what i'm doing actually works. in Windows i use DevC++ but i've recently installed Linux Mandrake 8.0 on my other computer and i'm not quite sure how to compile.......my friend said that Emacs had a compile in it so i wrote this:
#include <iostream.h>
int main()
{
std::cout "hello Chooco";
return 0;
}
then selected compile... and at the bottom it said "command make -k" so i went into the folder that had this little thing i wrote then typed "make -k" and it didn't do anything so i tried "make -k helloworld.cpp" (i saved it as helloworld.cpp) but it said it had nothing to do with that file. i checked the folder and it's right in saying it didn't do anything....help lol

also, i searched my hard drive for *gpp* and it found nothing :(

Use "gcc -o program program.cpp" to compile a C++ program (-o creates and executable named "program").  Then just use "./program" to run it.

You can also use "g++" instead of "gcc" if you want (g++ knows a little more about C++ compiling than gcc does, but either will work for simple stuff).

"parse error before string constant" is the message i get when i used the command "gcc -o program hello.cpp"
the program hello.cpp is like this:
#include <iostream.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main()
{
cout "hello myself";
return 0;
}

This...

cout "hello myself";

...should be...

cout << "hello myself" << endl;

oh i'm sorry, i forgot to include that. the code does have that << thing but not the endl thing....is endl important? what does it do?

it prints the next message on the next line, but you don't really need it since you only have one line of text
