#include <conio>

It will support it if you build a Win32 console application (i.e. an MS-DOS app).  Make sure you aren't building a Win32 Windows application, getch() won't do anything for you there.

hey, what's wrong with that ? The only thing that could be a problem that the message : "press any key to exit" isn't diplayed when the cout was executed, cause the cout is normally a buffered output. You can flush the content of the buffer to the output with cout.flush() (btw, with a <<endl the buffer is flushed automatically, but there u would have a CR, and i dunno if u wanna have it)

use:

code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;



or 

code:

std::endl; ...
std::getch(); ...



when using functions from the C++ standard library (in MSVC6 and later).

Alternatively, you could try using 
code:

#include <iostream.h>


but that's no longer recommended.

doh, I must've forgotten the using namespace std;
thing DOH! Thanks for pointing that out for me.
I haven't been doing anything C++ for like what 6 months?! So I have forgotten stuff.

WTF?! Why is it not working? Need help again. =\

code:
// Program contianing the getch keyword
// Written by me
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
      cout << "testing getch" << endl;
      cout << endl << "press any key to exit";

      getch();

      return 0;

}


I dunno why it's not compiling. I did it with Borland's Turbo C++ and it compiled. Why not MSVC++?

Nevermind I fixed it w00t w00t! Seems like I made a mistake, like for iostream. In the include folder there were 2 iostream files and only 1 conio file with the extension .h so I added

#include <conio.h> and poof it worked.
