OK, I know that you can't build the client.dll file under Borland because of the vgui.lib, and I know I should wait for the next SDK release, but, I'm workling on converting the vgui.lib to Borland to satisfy idal cuiousity. Now, in one of the VGUI include files (I think VGUI_Dar.h) there is a line that looks something like this;

template class VGUI Dar(class Button*);

Are these lines needed under Borland, and what is the correct syntax for Borland?

My understanding is that the only VGUI item you really need is the Port class (to define a view portal).

Try commenting out all the other stuff except the Port class and see if you are able to get any further than I did with it.

By the way, Leon Hartwig pointed out that using "implib" on the VGUI.DLL file will give you a Borland compatible VGUI.LIB file (from which to import VGUI function names).

"ranlib" with Borland produces a Borland-compatible vgui.lib file.  Is there a similar program with MingW32?

I tried using...

dlltool -D VGUI.DLL --export-all-symbols -l ming_vgui.lib -v

...in the Half-Life directory (where vgui.dll is located), but it didn't generate much of a .lib file.

I would highly recommend using the Borland C++ compiler over the MingW32 one anyway.
