Here's a handy library that speeds up file reading very much. Useful for parsing through a BSP file, for example, or for some waypoint file loading, or MegaHAL brain surgery. It's tested and it works.

I dump the whole stuff, do with it as you like.

Could you elaborate on exactly how it speeds up file reading?

Memory operations (seek, read, write) are MUCH faster than disk-based operations (seek, read, write). By completely loading the file into memory, you are no longer forced to seek and read directly from the hard disk. It is especially useful for recursive iterations on the same file.

This library could also be extended to support writing of files, actually I'd better do it too - and I think I will.

If you're doing file I/O on Windows machines, you might want to consider using Asynchronous I/O instead of using fread().  This will prevent your CPU from effectively putting your PC to sleep while loading that 10 megabyte file...

Not portable, won't use it ;)
Thanks for the idea anyway, that's one good thing to know.

and how much is it speeding up ? maybe you tell us some loading times of bsp, or something alike with and without that routines ...

I always thought the OS was doing a lot of caching and there is no need for such stuff except you wanna get the last percent of performance ...

It won't speed up much the loading of a BSP file, since the BSP lumps are loaded linearily.

What it can speed up very much though, is the case where you want to search for a pattern in a file, such as a .WAV file tag like "data" which starts the data lump. The algorithm is "read 4 bytes, compare, if wrong get back 3 bytes and read 4 bytes again". Since it's a lot of iobuf seek, it's very slow on disk operations.

For example, on ~200 WAV files, using basic file IO routines I compute the average loudness in ~15 minutes. With this one, and the exact same code, I compute it in ~20 seconds.

Well of course memory operations are faster than disk operations, that's not what I meant.  I was refering to why your library specifically speeds up the process, as you claim your library does :)

hey PM the MAX_MFILES isnt defined in that code, just wondering whats the optimum value for it? I just stuck in 16 for the heck of it :)

whatever value you want is OK, I stick to 255.
