your hard disk looks like it begins to lose sectors... backup everything you can, run a scandisk with surface testing, and if it doesn't fix the problem buy a new hard drive :(

The default HPB bot .dsw file tries to copy the DLL to the D: drive.  You will need to modify the Custom Build settings to match your Half-Life installation.

Go to "Project->Settings->Custom Build" in Visual Studio and change the path where it copies the DLL to (you can delete the entries for MODs that you do not have installed or don't want to build the HPB bot DLL for).
