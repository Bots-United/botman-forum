I am doing Counter-Strike server-side mod off HPB_bot.

I have it so my admins read from admins.ini thats not a problem. Though I want to be able to add a admin and delete a admin while in the server.

e.g: "syn addadmin 4" in the console, were the number 4 is the highest level admin (i have lvl 1 - 4)I know this is possible because I have seen it done before.

How would I add and delete a admin while in the server threw the console. Thanks.

To add, fopen() the .ini file, seek to the end of the file (see fseek documentation), fwrite() your new line at the end, fclose() the file.

To delete, fopen() the .ini file and fopen() a temporary file .tmp, read line by line until you find the admin you want to delete (using stricmp).  As you read each line from .ini fwrite() that line out to .tmp (skip the line that you want to delete).  When you get to the end of the .ini file, close both files, delete the .ini file and frename() the .tmp to .ini and you're done.
