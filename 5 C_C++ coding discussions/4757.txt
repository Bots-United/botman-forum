Bah, how can I get this to work? It only retrieves up to 15 characters which is useless.
GetModuleFileName just returned garbage unfortunately.

code:

void ListProcesses( void )
{
      PROCESSENTRY32 pe32;
      HANDLE handle;
      
      if ( ( handle = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot( TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0 ) ) == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE )
      {
            return;
      }

      if ( Process32First( handle, &pe32 ) )
      {
            while( Process32Next( handle, &pe32 ) )
            {
                  printf( "%s %d\n", pe32.szExeFile, pe32.th32ProcessID );
            }
      }

      CloseHandle( handle );
}



Any help is appreciated.

hm, when i use that exact code in an exe, it retrieves all of them, even ones with long names.

or is it the directories you want?

That seems odd, yes I did want the exes but they would max out at 15 chars. I made a function to return a char pointer to the first 15 characters and that worked fine util I stopped that project and moved on.
