Hi guys, im just wondering if this would be the right place to get help if someone just wants to "mess" around with the HL code. Who am i? Im a newbie concerning C or C++ coding. I just finished a C and C++ class and passed it :) What do i want? Get more familiar with C++.

First of all i have to admit that Botmans readme file, in which he explained how he got the bots working, inspired me to go ahead and "mess" around with the HL engine myself. This would be the right time to say...Thanks Botman...very well written readme file. That is the first readme i really enjoyed reading. :)

Here's what i want to accomplish at first. I also would like to build a dll which sits between the mod and HL. It's supposed to, just like Botmans dll, intercept engine calls.

When the map changes to a custom map you're able, as an server admin, to determine which files the player can download off the server through the *.res file. If there is no *.res file, the engine only sends the least required files in order to load the map wich would be the *.txt, *.bsp and *.wad file. Now if there is the *.res file, the player will be forced to download all the additional *.mdl and *.wav files, which he doesn`t really need in order to play the map. I just would like to give the player the choice to decide by himself if he wants to download the additional files or not. This could be done through a small menu while connecting giving 2 choices 1. Yes 2. No. Is it possible to display such a menu while connecting anyway? Is it possible at all?

Thanks and i appreciate every help!
Don't forget....im a newb :)

Tom

My suggestion is to build a metamod plugin. You should check out the metamod forums to see what metamod is all about.

I doubt you can allow the user top specify what missing files he wants downloaded because I think this sort of thing happens outside the SDK interface. However, I'm not 100% certain.

btw I think your questions may be better placed in the HL SDK forum.

Alright, Thanks!
I`ll try the SDK forum.
