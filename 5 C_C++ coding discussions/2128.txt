I got the source code for pgbot, I figured I would mess with it and see what I could do.  Before I did that though, I figured that I had better complile it first, to make sure everything was working fine before I missed it all up.  But it won't.  I set it up to build a .dll, I add bot.cpp, bot.h and client.cpp.  Then when I build it, I get 119 unresolved external symbols, that somehow add up to 193 link 2001 errors.  I guess some of them messed up twice.  So anyway, I complie with MS Visiual c, 6.0, anyone know what I need to do?

Everything prior to Bot Number 8 is for SDK 1.0 (which won't work with the current Half-Life engine version).

Uninstall the SDK (to remove screwed up files) and delete any remaining SDK files and directories.  Reinstall the SDK (version 2.0 or 2.1).  Start by building the UNMODIFIED SDK to make sure you can create a DLL without problems.

Download Bot Number 8, 9 or 10 source code and place those files in the dlls folder then build the DLL again after adding the bot*.cpp files to the project.  You should then be able to spawn bots into the game using the "addbot" console command.
