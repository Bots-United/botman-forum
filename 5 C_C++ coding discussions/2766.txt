I got MSVS 6.0 and i just had a question that maybe botman or someone could help me with.  Do i need to get an update or use a different #include to get the fprintf and fscanf to work?  because i'm having trouble with it.

thanks in advance

No, you shouldn't need a service pack to get fprintf() or fscanf() to work.  You might be trying to create a Windows application instead of a MS-DOS console application.

When you create a new project, make SURE you select "Win32 Console Application".  Here's a simple example of fprintf() and fscanf()...
code:

#include <stdio.h>

void main(void)
{
   FILE *fp;
   int x = 100;
   int y;

   fp = fopen("test.dat", "w");
   fprintf(fp, "%d\n", x);
   fclose(fp);
 
   fp = fopen("test.dat", "r");
   fscanf(fp, "%d", &y);
   fclose(fp);
 
   printf("y = %d\n", y);
}

thanks.   Will that produce the same result?  it is for a class and if it works like we need it to i will tell the teacher. he'll be happy. we have been stuck on it for a while.

i got a question. i put in my code and it says that missing function header (old-style formal list?) also it said system not specafied.  for system(cls); 

code:

// Project 12-1 Over due report
//
// Processing directives

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
//Function Prototypes

void OpenFile(void);
void ReadFile(void);

//Program setup

//Input corse record

FILE *inFile;
int callnum;
char name;
int hours;
float amount;


//Constants and variables

int OpenFlag = 0;

//
// MainLine control
//

void main(void)
{
      system("cls");
      OpenFile();
      if (OpenFlag == 1) {
            ReadFile();
            fclose(inFile);
      }
      return;
}

//
// Open file
//

void OpenFile(void);
{
      inFile = fopen("a:overdue.dat", "r");
      if (inFile == NULL);
      printf("Cannot Open file\n");
      else
            openFlag = 1;
      return;
}


//
//read file
//

void ReadFile(void);
{
      printf("\nAccontNumber#      Name#      Days#      Money#\n");
      scanf(inFile, "%d      %s      %d      %f", &callnum, name, &hours, &amount);
      while (!feof(inFile)) {
            printf("\n %3d      %-15s      %2d      %4.2f", call, name, hours, amount);
      }
      return;
}



it gives me these errors.
:\hw\12-1.cpp(33) : error C2065: 'system' : undeclared identifier
E:\hw\12-1.cpp(47) : error C2447: missing function header (old-style formal list?)
E:\hw\12-1.cpp(62) : error C2447: missing function header (old-style formal list?). 
and i don't know why and its buggin the heck out of me heh.. its a pain.. 

thanks in advance.

"system" function requires you to include the "dos.h" file

Also, get rid of the semicolons at the end of these lines...

void OpenFile(void);
{

void ReadFile(void);
{

thanks i didn't even catch those heh.  the win32 application worked great thanks man.   It reads files but when the file prints it keeps printing the information from the first line without goingt o the second like it is supose to.  is there anyting i need to put after to make it go to the next line?  Everything works but that. it sucks heh.  when i tell my teacher about this monday he will probably like flip. he has been making the class print to a file insted of using the fprintf to the screen.

Yeah, you need to scan the file again at the end of the while loop.
