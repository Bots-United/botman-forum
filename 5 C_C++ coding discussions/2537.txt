How do you clear the screen? EVERY time I use:

system("cls");

it doesn't work! I get the following error message:

This program can only be started by Microsoft Windows

I'm using the MingW compiler.

Any help is appreciated!

I didn't have any problems using MingW32 to clear the screen (this is my_cls.c)...
code:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
   char input[2];

   printf("press <ENTER> to clear the screen...");
   gets(input);

   system("cls");

   return 0;
}

...using "gcc -o my_cls my_cls.c" to compile the code and create the executable.

Cheesemonster yes I think there is but not for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 :/

Only in Borland or some others I can't remember..

its not seeming to work for me...
 the system("cls");
it says "undefined identifier" 
does anyone know why? or what the problem is?
(i use msvc++)

It probably means you havn't inlcluded the right header files...
I don't know what header files should be used for MSVC since i don't use it.. but it's usually something like..

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

p.s. Put these at the top of the file.
