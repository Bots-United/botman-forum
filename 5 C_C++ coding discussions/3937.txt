I'm having a problem with Visual C. When I compile large programs it freezes my comp forcing me to restart. It compiles the projects files fine but when they are all linked together it freezes. I'm running standard version 6.0 with service pack 5. I can compile 1 file programs fine but it freezes on large ones like the quake 1 source code and the half-life sdk. They used to compile fine when I was using the learning edition. Dose Visual C have a log file anywhere?

Thanks

There aren't any log files anywhere.

Try uninstalling MSVC, then reinstall it to see if that fixes your problem.

Maybe you need to reformat your hard disk and reinstall Windows.

You can try uninstalling MSVC, run the Windows install again without reformating first, then install MSVC and see if that works, if not, reformat your hard disk, reinstall Windows and all your Windows apps (including MSVC).
