Whats wrong with this?

code:

void somefunc()
{
    mystruct_t *p = new mystruct_t;
    somefunc2(p);
}

void somefunc2(mystruct_t *p)
{
    delete p; //boom
}




Can anyone tell me why it crashes on the "delete" ? Is there something obvious I've missed here? Is malloc() a better option? I know that the pointer is ok as its being used and works fine.

This worked perfectly fine on my machine...
code:
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct MYSTRUCT
{
   int x;
   float y;
   char *z;
} mystruct_t;

void somefunc2(mystruct_t *p);

void somefunc(void)
{
   mystruct_t *p = new mystruct_t;
   somefunc2(p);
}

void somefunc2(mystruct_t *p)
{
   delete p; // no boom
}

void main(void)
{
   printf("calling somefunc()...\n");
   somefunc();
   printf("done\n");
}

I suspect that your example doesn't EXACTLY match the code that's crashing.  Post the exact code.
