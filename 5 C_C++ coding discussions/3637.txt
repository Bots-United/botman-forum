i'm just asking if you would create a makefile for a TFC addon so we can compile it in Linux.....

i'm not in charge of the project and i'm not authorized to hand out the source even though i can get a copy easily but would you do it if you had the source?

i'm asking instead of the project leader because i know he won't ask for help from anybody.

Look on the metamod website for the metamod source.  It includes a makefile for building it on Linux.

If you want to build an HPB bot type hook DLL, you can download the HPB bot template source code (not the HPB bot 2.1 source code).  The template source code contains a makefile for Linux.
