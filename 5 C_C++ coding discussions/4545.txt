I know ill probably need this function...


code:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
qboolean            (*pfnClientConnect)            ( edict_t *pEntity, const char *pszName, const char *pszAddress, char szRejectReason[ 128 ] );
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But I have no idea whatsoever the structure of that function or what i should be returning as the qboolean.
Or how I would go about sending the message using the passed arguments and no idea what function to actually send it.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks
c0ld

I would rather hook ClientPutInServer()

Look in either of the open-source bots for Half-Life and/or Counter-Strike to find a way to do this.

use CLIENT_PRINTF() in the ClientCommand() function to print to the console when a player first connects, ClientPutInServer() is called too late for the "consgreet" type messages.

I meant clientconnect(), sorry, obviously ClientCommand() was not the answer.

Ah ok, we were not talking about the same thing.
I was thinking about some HUD text to welcome players (ala POD-bot welcome message) but you obviously were talking about a message on the client's console during the resources exchange (which indeed happens after ClientConnect()).
