ok, im pretty sure botman would know of such a program, but anyone is welcome to beat him to it :) :

im looking for some kinda 'network programmers tool'; a program that can act as a tcp/udp server and client, so i can test my networking programs.
kinda like a telnet client but for udp too, and ability to set it up as servers (ie echo) too. (if it could display data and take data as hex that would be even better).

im sure that such program exists, just not found one yet. can anyone help?

Please don't beat me.  :(

I'm sure that there are some simple socket libraries that will do some of what you want, but I don't know the URL to any at the moment.  You might try searching www.google.com for "windows network socket library" or something similar.

My Netprobe project has some simple examples of UDP socket connections (reading/writing) and has a simple routine to dump hex data in a nice ASCII format with hex values and ASCII values (similar to the dump format used by the MS-DOS debug command).  Take a look at those for most of what you want.  You will probably have to create the rest of it on your own since what you want sounds like something that pretty customized (most of the TCP/IP tutorials just show how to open a connection and send a simple message from the client to the server and back).

Ah, I think I phrased my question wrong;

Im looking for a stand alone application that I can set up to act as various types of server's for various types of protocols (tcp/udp..), or to work as a client and connect to servers. ie, when its in server mode it displays incoming data (if i could choose weather to display in ascii or hex that would be great), and when its in client mode i can compose packets and send em (similar to telnet, but any protocol, and with the ability to type in hex).

I am ok with network programming, what I need this for is to be able to test my clients/servers when I only have either one written, or to test the networking. I could write such a prog, but i am 99% that such a program already exists, so I dont want to do unnecesary work...

Reading up, I could still hardly understand what I wrote ... im so bad at descibing stuff :P

In other terms, you want an application that is able to :
-reads raw data from stdin and send it over the network at a certain address on a certain port,
-listens the network on a certain port and dumps the raw data to stdout,
am I right ?

ok, these are the features im looking for, it might take more than one program, but i was hoping there is some integrated toolkit with all these features and more ...

- act as a server on different protocols (tcp/udp) net 'n ipx etc ..
- when in server mode, display the incoming data in ascii or hex
- ability to make the server echo etc..
- act as a client to all those protocols, where i can send info via ascii (like telnet) or where i can compose my packets in hex.
- also when in client mode, display incoming data with the same options as the server.
- when in server mode send info with the same optiopns as the client.

gah this is so hard for me, lol.

In other terms this is a bare TCP/IP session. Open connexion, send data, receive data, dump it from and to stdin and stdout.

Well I don't think such a software exists 'as is', it's too simple... However you can have a look at the many tutorials that exist on the net about TCP and UDP sessions programming, and I'm sure you'll end up with programming your own stuff in about twenty lines of code.

sortof, but what im looking for is not as simple as what your talking about. anyway, its too hard for me to explain, i think i will just make it, but i will keep a look out, as i am sure that something like this exists.

thanks for the help guys :)
