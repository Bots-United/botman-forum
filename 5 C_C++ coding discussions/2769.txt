im reading still....and i decided to try and make a test prog... and i dont seem to know whats going wrong.

here it is.... please tell me whats wrong

#include <iostream.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


int main()
{
      cout << "This program is only a joke.  It is not meant to be taken seriously. ";
      cout << "Please type in your name and press <ENTER>";
      char szName[256];
      cin.getline(szName, 128);
      system("cls");
      cout << "How old are you? (in years)";
      int nAge;
      cin >> nAge;
      system("cls");
      cout << "What year do you think you will live to?\n(Example: 2037)";
      system("cls");
      int nYear;
      cin >> nYear;
      int nReal = nYear - 1990 - nAge;
      if (nReal <= 1)
      {
            cout << "That is not possible. You cannot live " << nReal << " more years!\nThis means you are already dead " << szName << "!\nStop lying " << szName << "!  Next time please tell the truth for a more fun time. =P\n \n(don’t lie)\n";
      }
      else
      {
            cout << "You will live " << nReal << " more years " << szName << ".\n";
      }
      return 0;
}

QUOTE:

If i expect to live to the year 2050, the above line wont work that out.

int nReal = nYear - 2002 would though.

hey.. does the program work for you?
or is there a problem?
for me... it exits after i type in the year
can anyone tell me what im doing wrong?
(for some reason it works through msvc++ but not when fully compiled)

Put the following at the end (just before the return 0 statement):

int i;
cout << "Press enter to exit";
cin >> i;

This will prevent the console window from closing before you have a chance to see the output.  VC++ does this for you when you execute a console app from the IDE.

Whoops!  Sorry... that code will require you to input a number then press Enter.  Chalk it up to the fact that I almost never use the standard streams.  Anyway, the point is that you need something to keep the program from terminating before you can see the output.  I know there's a way to make it wait just for enter, but I can't remember how right now.  Sorry.

is there a way to make it say something else...
like please press enter or anything that pretty much does the same thing as system("pause")instead of please press any key?  just curious.... thanks in advance and to spikeles!

i dunno if this'll work!

code:

#include <conio.h>



code:

cout << "Press Enter";
getch();

Things were so much simpler in QBASIC... :)

pretty simple.

code:
//add this to the very top
#include <conio.h>

//then add this somewhere on the end of your source

getch();
cout << "press a key to exit ";

it needs the ide file otherwise it will do that, borland did that to my roommate and he put in some pointless cin streams at the end so the program would work correctly but its not the best way.
