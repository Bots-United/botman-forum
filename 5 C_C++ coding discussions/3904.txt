You'll need thewww.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?planethalflife/botman/SDK_2_2_Patches.zip sdk 2.2 patch file for compiling with borland free compiler. There should be a "readme" file
included which tells you how to set it up.


BTW: does anybody how to change the path where borland creates your ".exe" file? Like the default place the compiler puts it in is the "bin" folder.

The compiler will put the .exe file into the current directory unless you tell it to put it someplace else.

Using a makefile, this can be accomplished just by specifying a relative or specific path before the executable name.  For example...

-o ..\..\my_program.exe

...could be used if you wanted to place the executable 2 directory levels higher.  Or you could use...

-o "C:\Program files\MyProg\my_program.exe"

...if you wanted to place the executable in a specific directory.

well I tried what you said botman but, it doesn't work. Either I didn't get what you said or did it wrong, So I tried:

-nC:\borland\bcc5\projects\

and it did kinda work..but it puts the files in the my "c:\borland\bcc55\" folder, NOT my projects folder

Update:
=======

Never mind, I figured it out!!
