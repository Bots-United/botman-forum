Does someone exactly know how to compile
with Borland?
I couldn't understand the readme.

The ReadMe.txt file is pretty explicit.  What part did you not understand?  Do you know how to start the MS-DOS prompt?  What version of Windows are you using?

This is kind of on the same subject:

I can't compile the full SDK :(

I could compile just the Server-Side dll just fine, but then I figured out that the full SDK has all the AI codes for hgrunts, barney etc...

And I wanted to make changes to thoses.

So anyway, I set it up exacly like I did the server-side SDK. I ran all the batch files etc, I even installed Borland on my D: drive like it had in the readme and the HL SDK in D:\Half-Life\Source code\dlls

But when I do the bcc.bat it comes up like it should. I go to MS-DOS and put in:

C:\WINDOWS>D:
D:\Borland>bcc.bat
D:\Borland>SET BCC_DIR=D:\Borland\Bcc55
D:\Borland>PATH=D:\Borland\Bcc55\bin;C:\PROGRA~1\ULTRAE~1;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\command

D:Borland>cd "\Half-Life\sdk\source code\dlls"
D:\Half-Life\SDK\Source Code\dlls>make

Make Version 5.2 Copyright (c) 1987, 200 Borland

What does that mean?

Thanks for your help.

My SourceCode directory has no space between "Source" and "Code". Check it.

Also there should be a verbose option to Borland's make. It would show you the files being compiled and linked. Anyhow if your Makefile is correct all should go fine.

:)

"D:\Half-Life\SDK\Source Code\dlls>make 

Make Version 5.2 Copyright (c) 1987, 200 Borland 

What does that mean?"

That means the Borland make utility can't find a makefile.  You need to copy the file named "Makefile_Borland" to "Makefile" in the dlls directory (and in the cl_dll directory).

Once you do this, when you run "make", it will build the hl.dll file.

When I do the bcc.bat or any other file,
nothing happens.

Are you running BCC.BAT from within an MS-DOS window or just clicking on it in Windows Explorer?  If it's Windows Explorer, you're correct, that won't do anything, you need to start an MS-DOS prompt instead.

It looks like you don't have the MinGW C++ compiler installed correctly or you don't have the MinGW bin directory in your path.

Where did you install the MinGW compiler?  What do you have in the .bat file that you run to set up the environment?

I installed it in c:\program\c 
and my bin is here: C:\Program\c\bin  
i think thats correct because it was like that when i first installed it.

Which *.bat file do you mean I Didnt get one!!

As i said im a new to comoiling and everything..
I hav only used pascal before. Thnx . waiting..

You need to create a .bat file to initialize the MS-DOS environment for the MinGW compiler and linker.

There are directions for doing this in the SDK 2.2 patches ReadMe.txt file...

It looks like you didn't run the DO_PATCH.BAT file first.  The unmodified SDK 2.2 source code WILL NOT build with Borland or MinGW.

Follow the directions in the ReadMe.txt file included with the SDK 2.2 patches.

1. Download the SDK 2.2 source code.

2. Download, install and configure the C++ compiler.

3. Run the DO_PATCH.BAT file to modify the SDK code to be compatible with other compilers.

4. Run "make" to build the default SDK mp.dll (or hl.dll).

Sure, it's possible, but you'll have to figure it out on your own.

See the changes in my patches for SDK 2.2 to know what types of things you will need to change.  You will also need to make your own Makefile (again see the SDK 2.2 patches for an example Makefile for MinGW).
