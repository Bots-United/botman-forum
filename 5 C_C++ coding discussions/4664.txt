Hello everyone! I still can't understand why unresolved exdternals happen, that is why asking here for help on how to solve this.

My program uses wglext.h where:

extern BOOL WINAPI wglSwapIntervalEXT (int);
typedef BOOL (WINAPI * PFNWGLSWAPINTERVALEXTPROC) (int interval);

when I use wglext.h and call:

wglSwapIntervalEXT(0);

linker tels me about unresolved external wglSwapIntervalEXT in engine.obj... What to do? :(

Thanks!

maybe this wglext.h is just the interface to some dll ? i.e. you use some library ( somehow wgl looks familiar, but dunno what it was, at the moment ), and you have the definition. you also need to tell the linker where the code can be found, and this is normally a .dll or .so file. To do this, you normally need to link with some .lib or .a file ...

Try adding these to your linked libraries... you might not need all of them

opengl32.lib glu32.lib glaux.lib
