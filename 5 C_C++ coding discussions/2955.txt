Whenever i include more than one header in MSVC++, things just start acting up.  

like just say

code: 
#include <iostream.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    cout << "just wont work";
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}

if a built the program, the msg "just wont work" doesnt display, until after i press a key. Has anyone had problems like this or know how to stop this? other than using <iostream> and std::?
Thank you in advance.

Change...

cout << "just wont work";

...to...

cout << "just wont work" << endl;

...The endl prints out a carriage return at the end of the line.

if you don't want a carriage return there you could also write cout.flush()
