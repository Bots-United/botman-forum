Sorry, I'm programming Object Pascal, but maybe it is the same way on C/C++?

How do I make a connection to a HL/CS server from an application, so that I can see how many players are in the servere, which map they're playing and so on?

I guess botmans netprobe source-codee may give you some info on how to do this, the only killer drawback is, it's in C/C++ so you'll need to decipher the C-code into pascal of course!

I don't think I can find some stuff in that source, because I know nothing about C++ :)

Check out the "server protocol.txt" file in the HL SDK. It will give you basic info on how to query a game server and get back basic information like number of players, map playing, etc.

I am currently using a PHP page to inquire and get info from my server. In my spare time, I am porting that to java but having a problem getting all the info back.

Yeah HL servers respond to special packets.  Like said, the server protocal file tells you what data to send to get back information.
