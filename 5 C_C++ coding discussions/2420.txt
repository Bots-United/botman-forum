Although i have searched myself on the web for such a program, can anyone recommend me such a program? 

All i need is a list of differences between 2 sources.

MS Windiff sucks MASSIVELY compared to BeyondCompare.  Try out BeyondCompare for a few days, I guarantee you'll like it, or no money back!
