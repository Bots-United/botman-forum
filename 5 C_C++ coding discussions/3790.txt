how exactly does this function work? is it possible to make things 'useable' with it?

The Half-Life engine calls DispatchUse when entities are being USEd.

If your code calls DispatchUse with the proper edict_t entity pointer and the entity has a valid USE function set up (by the MOD DLL code calling the SetUse() function), there is no difference between your code USEing an entity and the engine USEing an entity.  (just don't assume that all entities are useable since they won't be if they haven't set up a USE() function first).
