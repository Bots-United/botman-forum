When you want to play half-life on server that's full you can typ  /retry in the console and then hl will retry it.
But i was wondering if there is somekind of a script that auto retry.

I'm not sure why I thought gamespy arcade could do this.  It would be difficult for any external application to know whether the Half-Life client sucessfully connected to a server.  The console "retry" command is probably the best way of doing this.

In gamespy 3D, if you press control-B, a dialog will come up that will keep refreshing the server until a player spot opens up. You can choose to either have it start half-life when that happens or just have it alert you. You can also define a custom filter to have conditions other than just waiting for a player spot to open up.
