--------------------------------------------------
code:
Makefile:351: target `/home/bogues/atac/hlds_l/cstrike/addons/metamod/atac_mm_i386.so' given more than once in the same rule.
gcc -ggdb3 -Wall -Wno-unknown-pragmas  -DOPT_TYPE=\"debugging\" -Wno-unused -fno-rtti -fPIC -I. -I../metamod -I/home/bogues/atac/hlsdk/multiplayer source/engine -I/home/bogues/atac/hlsdk/multiplayer source/common -I/home/bogues/atac/hlsdk/multiplayer source/pm_shared -I/home/bogues/atac/hlsdk/multiplayer source/dlls -I/home/bogues/atac/hlsdk/multiplayer source -o debug.linux/atac_api.o -c atac_api.cpp
gcc: cannot specify -o with -c or -S and multiple compilations


im a complete nub to this, I used the makefile from metamod, since it said it can be used for plugins, modified the top and...there

Any help plz?

Where you have "multiplayer source", you might want to rename the directory to "multiplayersource" and change this in the Makefile.

Linux doesn't like having directory names with spaces in them.

As in MS-DOS, this should not be a problem if the path is included within 2 double quotes "/usr/local/some path with spaces in it".

I found that copying files over from a fat partition requires a \ to go infront of the space...

ex. /home/lazy/Server\ Protocol.txt

I'm not sure if its the same for directories though, or even if thats how you did it.

thx botman, that worked, but now i got runtime problems to solve...

And vtw lazy linux partitions arent FAT, I'm not sure what they are they have their own name.

I know they aren't fat, I just mentioned that copying files from a mounted fat partition seemed to have that effect on files.

Good to hear you got it working though. :)
