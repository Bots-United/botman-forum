hi,

sorry if I'm such a newbie here....My question is what happens if a letter is input instead of a number in something like:
code:
int num;
cin >> num;


I read somewhere that the compiler will stop processing immediately when it was expecting a number and got a character. Is that true?

I hardly ever use I/O streams, but if I remember correctly, the value of 'num' remains unchanged (in this case undefined since you never initialized it).

How about something like this...
code:
int num = -1;  // invalid value

while (num == -1)  // loop until valid
{
   cout << "Enter a number, dammit!" << endl;
   cin >> num;
   if (num == -1)
      cout << "...read the instructions, dumbass!" << endl;
}

cout << "Thank you for entering the number " << num << endl;

I would guess no matter the data type, only the bytewise value is stored... Strings would be stored as pointers, hence int's, and characters would be stored as 8-bit integers. But I hardly ever use IO streams too.
