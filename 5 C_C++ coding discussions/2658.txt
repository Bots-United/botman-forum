Looks like you are missing the include files from the SDK common and/or engine directory.

The const.h file should be in the SDK "common" directory.

If the files are there then you don't have "..\common" and "..\engine" in your C++ include path.  See the .dsp file included with the SDK for the proper include path settings.
