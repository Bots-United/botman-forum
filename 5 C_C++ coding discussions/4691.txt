Hey,
I want to learn how to code bots in IRC in C++. Does anyone know any good tutorials? I'm using Windows. I don't want the source code of a IRC Bot in C++ just a tutorial.

Also does anyone know where I can find a good tutorial on coding Counter-Strike Bots?

Chris, if you want, I have a metamod plugin for Half-Life that is actually an IRC bot, using Windows sockets. It enables HL servers to "proxy" their player's chat to an IRC channel and the IRC channel's chat to the player's HUD. The source code is quite commented and available for everyone to read.

Check it at www.racc-ai.com, downloads section, and scroll down to the metamod stuff.
