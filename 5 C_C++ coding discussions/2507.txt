It means it won't return a value ;D I.e. it doesn't send anything back (not that it really will since it is the main function anyway)

Void is just a type, so is .. int, char etc ;D You could have an "int main()" function instead which will return an int (integer) value, but I suggest sticking to the void function types if you are really new to C/C++ :)
