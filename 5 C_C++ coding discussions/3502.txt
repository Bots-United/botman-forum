Okay, using UDB sockets to communicate with HL servers is pretty well documented.  What about communicating with the client?

I'm specifically looking for the message to send to the client to find out the current server ip "ÿÿÿÿget <what?>", though any place where said commands are documented would be appreciated.

Well, I was more curious about getting info from the server. Do you have a example project that you could send me? deacon@mail.dk

Well, if anyone is interested I found that the variable for the server ip is "serveraddress"
