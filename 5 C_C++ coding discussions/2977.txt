oki, i have a binary read/write file open, and i want to 'erase' some of the file and make it smaller. can anyone tell me how to do that?

(in my specific case, i just want to delete everything after the file pointer, basically set the current pointer position to be eof, and just delete everything after it)

On Win32 platforms use the _chsize() function.  On Linux platforms use the truncate() function.

See your compiler documentation for details.
