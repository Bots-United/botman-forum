Is it possible to display the line numbers in MVC 6.0?  I know there is the "go to line" but is it possible to display the number of each line?  Just somthing ive been wondering about for awhile. :D

I've never found a way to turn on line numbers in the MSVC internal editor.  I don't think that is a feature that MSVC supports.

The current line number is displayed in the MSVC status bar (and make sure you have it enabled).
There's indeed no facility like EditPlus has.

For programming however, I prefer MSVC (especially the .NET IDE) over EditPlus.
