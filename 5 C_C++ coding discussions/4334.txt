Hi Botman.
I downloaded you src of hpb bot, and i use it now for my bot (ch bot) [for CS]

But the bots won't rescue the hostages and they wn't buy anything.

Can you help me??

cause botman's favorite isnt cstrike, I guess, there is no real cs support - so you gotta code the rescue and buy system yourself. do a search on the forums to find other open source bots ( team, racc, pod, joe e.g. ) if you wanna start some copy and paste adventure ;) or take some free weeks, get into the code and code the stuff yourself. those two things ... it isnt that difficult !
