Hello!

I wanna create something that can look up a server's info. Like map name, plays, time left etc... But I don't know how to do it.
So please send a example project :)

Download my NetProbe source code.  It contains 2 simple C programs to do what you want.

Botman, I don't know how to use NetProbe.

You don't have to use it.  The two C programs are just included as examples of how to get info from the WON master server and how to get info from a Half-Life game server.

But I am using MSVC, so what do I do with them?
I'm kinda newbie, why is it C files and not CPP?

Please tell me what to do with the files to compile.

C tells the compiler to compile it with C not the C++ language.  Basically if you want to query a server you have to do the following:
1. Open a socket using UDP. (SOCK_DGRAM)
2. Bind the socket to an address. (Optional)
3. Send the message to the server. It can be:
"\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFFinfo"
"\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFFdetails"
"\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFFplayers"
"\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFFrules"
4.Recieve the packet and parse the information using the guidelines in "server protocol.txt".  You can get that file from the SDK (Not source only one!!)

You don't want him to write your source code, either ?
Just open MSVC, open his .C file and read.

Well, how do I compile it, and which of the C files do I need?
There isn't created a project for the files so how do I do it?

Look at the comments in the top of the file.

Just open an MS-DOS prompt (Start->Programs->MS-DOS Prompt or Start->Run->cmd.exe), change to your MSVC "bin" directory and run the VCVARS32.BAT file to set up the environment.

Then just use...

cl xxx.c wsock32.lib

(obviously replacing "xxx" with the name of the C program).

Botman, how do I add more stuff to my program?
I want the time left, anti-cheat tool and so on.
Can you help me with that?

"time-left" is not one of the commands available through the server network interface.

You will have to write your own plugin (I suggest using metamod for this) and add a new network connection to the server to send custom data from the server to the client.  Of course this will require that the server be running your plugin.

What about the anti-cheat tool they are using.
How can I do that?

IF you are talking about Valve's Anti-Cheat (VAC), you don't have access to it.  Valve hasn't released any information on how the anticheat works or what engine interfaces are available for it.

If you are talking about some other anti-cheat tool (HLGuard, etc.), you should e-mail the people that make that tool or post questions in the forums on their website.

No, you don't get what I mean.
I wanna add info about the server's anti-cheat.
For instance:
Anti-cheat: HLGuard, VAC.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Again, Valve hasn't released ANYTHING about VAC (you can't get information on something that doesn't tell you how to get information on it).

For HLGuard or other anti-cheats, you need to ask the developers of this software (not asking people here).

But the program "HLSW" can do it.
Try it, www.hlsw.de !

Botman, how about some code to get the server's ping. That is possible but do you know how ?

(please post the code here)

This is from the "server protocol.txt" file in the "Server Info" folder of the SDK (the large one, not the source code only SDK)...
code:
Game servers will answer the following messages:
Messages are sent to the server by sending 4 consecutive bytes of 255 (32-bit integer -1) and then the string command followed by a zero byte to terminate it

"ping"
      Server responds with a single byte code ASCII 'j'

"info"
      Server responds with the following packet:
      (int32)            -1
      (byte)            ASCII 'C' (info response, S2A_INFO)
      (string)            net address of server
      (string)            name of the host / server
      (string)            name of the map
      (string)            game directory (i.e. valve/)
      (string)            Game description (e.g. "half-life multiplay")
      (byte)            active client count
      (byte)            maximum clients allowed
      (byte)            protocol version (currently 7)

"players"
      Server responds with the following packet:
      (int32)            -1
      (byte)            ASCII 'D' (players response, S2A_PLAYER)
      (byte)            active client count

      for each active client
            (byte)            client number / index
            (string)            player name
            (int32)            client's frag total
            (float32)            client's total time in-game

"rules"
      Server responds with the following packet:
      (int32)            -1
      (byte)            ASCII 'E' (rules response, S2A_RULES)
      (int16)            number of rules

      for each rule
            (string)            rule name
            (string)            rule value

You need to download the large SDK (Full or Standard) that comes with these documents (the source code only .zip file doesn't come with any documents).

I think the "info" packet was upgraded to include the "secure" flag for CS servers (you'll see the little yellow exclamation mark in the Half-Life server browser for servers that are not secure).  This isn't telling you anything ABOUT Valve anti-cheat, it's only telling you if the server is running in secure mode or not.

Some other ways to detect what the server is running could be to send the "rules" query.  They you look through the rules for things specific to the addition (such as public_slots for adminmod).  I think there also might be a secure "1" or secure "0" varible in the rules, not 100% positive about that though.  Just look through the rules for anything that show extra information.

i can't see where in the C file get_info.c that botman is sending the different commands to get the info, so how do I add more things?

Oh, sorry.
now I can see the "info"...
How could I include "players"?

Change "info" to "players" and change what it does with the response packet (since the response to "info" and the response to "players" is not the same).

What do I do, if I want both of them.
"info" and "players"?

Keep the part with "info" and add another section to the code that sends the "players" packet.

(I'm sure you knew the answer to this already.  Did you really have to ask that question?)
