void foo()
{
    Vector *pos = new Vector(1,2,3);
    global_variable = pos;
}

Does pos get deleted once this function returns? If not, can I delete pos without killing the vector that global_variable is pointing to? I guess my real question is how can I create an object, have some other variable point to the newly created object, and then delete the original object? Sorry if my wording is confusing, I am just not sure how to phrase the question.

Thanks

because pos is just a pointer, the pointer is deleted when the function ends. the allocated data is not deleted, therefore you can still access the vector(1,2,3) by this global variable.

but you shouldnt forget to call delete global_variable; on exiting your program or before calling the function again.

"but you shouldnt forget to call delete global_variable on exiting your program or before calling the function again." 

I need to call delete because after I call foo() global_variable will be pointing to a new Vector object and the old one would still exist in memory with no one pointing to it? right?

so is it valid to do this
void foo()
{
   Vector *pos = new Vector(1,2,3);
   delete global_variable;
   global_variable = pos;
}

you have to be sure if global_variable is a valid pointer pointing to a valid vector object before calling delete. If you initialized global_variable with 0 at the beginning you could do this by just using this :
code:
if(global_variable){
delete global_variable;
}


somewhere at least you should have a delete operator if you have a new operator, otherwise you would have a so called memory leak, i.e. you reserve memory for you application, but you don't use it, instead you allocate more.
