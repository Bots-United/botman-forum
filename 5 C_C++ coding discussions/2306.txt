Ok, not too long ago a friend and I ventured to write a C++ program to listen to my tfc server and parse all "say" commands into a mysql database. This database is a part of a webbased chat room on my website for the game server. And in return I wrote some PHP to allow people in the chat room to send messages back to the game. The ultimate goal of this project is to turn it into an irc bot...

Anyway on to my point:

Now that the voice communications is working in game I'd like to be able to parse that into the chat room as well. But I need to understand how it works in order to know how to extract that information from the server. Hoping someone could point me to some reading material about this technology. 

Also, I'd like to set up sort of a "web cam" for my tfc server. Perhaps using the hltv program. I'd like to grab a screen shot of actual game play at regular intervals for use on a webpage. Any ideas or links to how this technology works also appreciated.

I realize this wont be an easy task but I am confident that I can do it. People told me the game to chat room communications couldn't be done and I managed to get that working.

The latest SDK 2.2 should point you into the right direction (whereever you can get that though!! :-/ )
