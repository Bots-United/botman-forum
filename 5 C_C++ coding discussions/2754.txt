This is the stack of my bot after it crashed ( it crashes always at the moment :( ). Well, I see that fgetc is called and that some function called afterwards from this function tries to allocate some memory. But why does it crash somewhere in there ? Never had programs crashing on memory allocation, normally one should have quite an amount of virtual memory these days on one's computer, but my task monitor doesn't show anything which looks like a memory leak.

so does anybody know why this happens ?!

thx

The only possible thing i can think of is that the file being passed to fgetc ( (_iobuf * 0x0c2739f8) wasn't opened correctly. Otherwise i have no idea...sorry m8.

Try using other file input functions on the same file ptr and see if they crash as well. 

In fact.. try using fgets and reading the entire line instead of one charcter and parsing the buffer for your character. ( probably faster than reding char by char)

well, that fgetc is one of the few lines that are left over from botman's template code :)

If I comment all that stuff out I get a similar crash somewhere else ... here when i add a bot :

code:

NTDLL! 778cb9b1()
NTDLL! 778cbe27()
NTDLL! 778cbd6c()
JOEBOT! _heap_alloc + 75 bytes
JOEBOT! _nh_malloc + 16 bytes
JOEBOT! operator new(unsigned int) + 11 bytes
BotCreate(edict_s * 0x0c190cee, const char * 0x01687d2c, const char * 0x05348b90, const char * 0x05348b90, const char * 0x05348b90) line 270 + 10 bytes
bc_addbot(edict_s * 0x01687d2c, int 1, const char * 0x05348b90, const char * 0x05348b90, const char * 0x05348b90, const char * 0x05348b90) line 16

ClientCommand(edict_s * 0x051644d4) line 1116 + 26 bytes
HW! 051644d4()
HW! 0515871d()



it's still always crashing when i want to allocate memory, in this case i wanted to allocate memory for a new instance of the bot class.

sorry bothering you, these errors were obviously provoqued by allocating a 4 byte to small bit array ... stupid me !
