I hope someone can help me on this. I am writing a little program that should display the waypoints i saved into an INI file. Waypoint information is saved like:

code:

[WAYPOINT]
Id=0
VecX=1951.000000
VecY=607.000000
VecZ=36.031250
...


The VecX, VecY, VecZ floats are directly from Half-Life. Now, i want to plot these waypoints on the map using my other program on the overview. I saw all overviews are 1024x768. For a starter i'd just want to draw them in this mode. However, i don't know how to draw them correctly! All i need to know is practicly the correct X,Y coordinates to draw a pixel on...

any ideas?

Hmmm?  You will need to know the 'min' and 'max' bounding box for the map.  Then rescale the X,Y,Z coordinates so that they fit within that range.

There is something similar to this that I do for the bsp_slicer tool in my BSP tools utilities.  You can see the source code there if you want a reference.

If you want the same thing heavily commented, you may want to have a look at what I did in my bot template #1, about the BSP stuff.

I read the BSP data, get the absmin and absmax of the map, and then know where, relatively to (0, 0, 0), the map is centered around. Then I divide the map into sectors, parallels and meridians, and I sort the walkable faces through them.

You will need a similar algorithm for determining the X and Y position on the map to draw your waypoint on.

If you want to draw lines as well, you can use botman's Bresenham() function that clamps a 1st-order line equation onto a dot matrix, it can be found in his BSP_slicer.

and maybe you take a look at the joebot sources, there is a folder called wpstat3d or similar, it is loading overviews and displaying waypoints too. ( although you cannot call it heavily commented :D )
