Hello.

I am trying to do this little thing that can send commands to the HL Console. Such as a "/say This message is from MYPROGRAM.EXE".
How is that possible? Please help me! THANKS!

hl console as in dedicated server? it's the same as you would to sendmessage to other types of console (get the console handle, use console APIs), but sendmessage is for windows messages, not hl messages... you either export a function from the mod dll to print your message or create a client that speaks the hl protocol using sockets and stuff like that.. (btw is it documented somewhere?)

This question has been already discussed several times on botman's forums (more than once, actually). I'm lazy and I don't feel like I'm gonna look for the URLs of the threads, but you can give a go to the search feature of this forum.
