I know, this somehow sounds crazy and looks more like some wrong pointer writing shit or something ...

I have a program with 2 threads ... one displaying the data, another doing calculations on it. For the visualization I don't want access the data at random points of time, but I want to do this at the end of each calculation iteration. So I wanted to put this one diagram into some display list which is updated after every iteration. the calculation thread there sets some global flag to show that the display list should be updated, i.e. there isnt any openGL code executed in the calc thread.
displaying the data without using that display list works fine, the only drawback is that this one diagram doesnt look stable. Now I added this display list thingie and the main thread displaying the data drops to the update frequency of the iterations in the calculation thread ... as if I havnt used 2 threads, but only 1 ... and if I switch this diagram off, i.e. no display list generation involved any more, the fps of the display thread go up to the value I want them to. very strange I think

does anybody has any idea here ?

Perhaps the variables you share between these two threads are "locked" by some thread or the other when they are read or written, thus causing the two to "synchronize" their fps...

You want an idea ? Send your data to the display thread through an UDP port ...
or some Windows socket...

a simple global variable blocking a whole thread ? tried declaring it static or volatile, but that didnt help ... i think the reason has to be the display list, dunno, I keep on searching
