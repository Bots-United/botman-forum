I noticed that when someone was attempting to use a program to communicate with Half-Life from an extrnal program. He was told he would have to use console! Therefore I was looking to know if there was any way you can communicate with the console from an external program?

Thanks,

If you wish to send console commands to the server, you will need to use rcon (remote console).

The packet sequence for issuing rcon commands can be found in the Half-Life SDK which can be downloaded from www.valve-erc.com (get the large FULL or STANDARD SDK, don't get the source code only .zip file).

Look at "server protocol.txt" found in the "Server Info" folder of the SDK.  That explains how to issue rcon commands.

You'll also need to know the rcon password of the server that you wish to execute commands on.
