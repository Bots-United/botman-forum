Hey.
I was just wondering...is there any way to compile for Linux on Windows ?
I use WinXP home and the only Linux I have available to me are Suse 6.1 and Open 1.2.
I also use a 56k modem (Im in Ireland) so downloading a distro is out of the question.
Is there any way I can compile a .so on Windows ?
Thanks

There was a discussion about this a while back.

Search this forum for "windows cross compile linux" or something similar.  You want to do a "cross compile for Linux on Windows".
