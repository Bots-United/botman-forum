I need to scan a file that will contain multiple wonids and user names to get the wonid, how can I just get the wonid from this file so I can match it up to see if its the players? This is what the file will look like:
wonid playername
anotherwonid anotherplayername

Thanks for anyhelp

Open the file in text mode (using fopen), then read a line at a time using fgets() (yeah, I know it's unsafe, so what!), find the length of the string you are hunting for (using strlen), then use strncmp() with the length that you just found as the 'n' part of strncmp().

Just keep reading through the file (while loop) until you reach the end of the file (eof), or you found the string you're looking for.

When you find the line your looking for, you can access the playername part of it by skipping over N characters (same length that you used in the strncmp above).

Ok, Im having a little trouble with it thought, this is what im using:
code:

char tmp[80];
sprintf(msg,"%u",GETPLAYERWONID(pEntity) );
int WonidLength = strlen(msg);

fp=fopen("tfc\\players.txt","r");
while(!feof(fp))
{
      fgets(tmp,WonidLength,fp);

      if(strncmp(msg,tmp,WonidLength))
      {
            CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, "Recognized\n");
      } else {
            CLIENT_PRINTF(pEntity, print_console, "Not Recognized\n");
      }
      
}
fclose(fp);


Thanks.

you could try using _eof _open. I use these, but i am not sure if they are Visual C++.NET only...

code:

int fp;

fp = _open( "tfc\\players.txt", _0_RDONLY );

while (!_eof(fp))
{
    _read( fp, tmp, WonidLength );    
}

_close( fp );




I hope i helped in any sort of way, the File I/O stuff isn't my main area...for most of my programming language usage...

Leon, what you have should work.

Try to simplify things.  Replace msg with 'X', and replace WonidLength with 1.  Place a line in your text file with 'X' as the first character.  Your code should find it.
