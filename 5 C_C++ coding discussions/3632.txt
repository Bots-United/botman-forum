I'm making a new text game to test out my c++ skills but i need help.  How do you call functions from another file, also how do you call other files in a c++ program.

Let's say you have a function called X1() in the x1.cpp file.  Now you want to call that function from somewhere in y2.cpp.  The most common way to do this is to create a header file for x1.cpp called x1.h that would have something like this...

void X1(int a, float b);

...then in y2.cpp you would put...

#include "x1.h"

void MyFunc(void)
{
   X1(5, 10.573);
}

...then you compile x1.cpp, y2.cpp and link them together to form an executable (let's call it z.exe).

As long as you provide the proper function prototype in your header files (*.h), you will be able to call functions in one file from any other file (as long as it includes the proper .h header file with those function prototypes).
