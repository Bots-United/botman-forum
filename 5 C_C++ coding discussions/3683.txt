Hi,

I need help on this program I'm writing. How do you do tell the compiler to find square root of a number? I mean I know if you want to find area or triangle you do 
code:

b*h/2


but how do you do it to find square root?

the function is called double sqrt(double) and defined in math.h

use the sqrt() function, also you'll need to include "math.h" to the project

Or you could use the pow() function...
code:
float x, y;

x = 123.45f;
y = pow(x, 0.5f);

Why do you need the square root?  Sometimes you can completely avoid it, as it isn't the fastest function around.

True.  For example, if you are comparing two distances, just compare the squares of the distances instead of the square root.  This will save you many floating point instructions that you don't need anyway since, if distance A is larger than distance B, the square of distance A is also larger than the square of distance B.
