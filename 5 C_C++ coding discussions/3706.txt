hello

once again with my stupid questions.
I want to run a program from another one (i.e. I want my bot code to launch a Win32 executable that will run and quit on its own), but without using system(), because system() pops up a DOS box to execute the command passed as an argument, and I don't want that.

1° Is it possible ?
2° How to do ?
3° Is it portable ?

Thanks in advance, again && again.

Look at the exec() function...

Yes, exec() is portable to Unix/Linux.
