i didn't know where to post this, there isn't exactly a general discussion site.

Ok, every time i try to run the singing walter winamp visualization i get an "Error opening registry key for Half-Life InstallPath" error.

i currently am using windows XP however, i origionally installed HL under windows ME.

that's probably what my problem is but, as to the fact that my HL CD is scratched beyond recognition, i can't reinstall (the patches would be a bitch anyway)

i'm posting this purely for feedback.  i'd like to know if anyone else has recieved that same error....and if they discovered a fix for it.

you could change the fetching of the path, in the source to not use the registry, but i suggest getting a new copy of the half-life cd

To bypass the Half-Life registry setting, add his line to the walter.ini file in the Winamp\Plugins folder...

halflife_dir=C:\SIERRA\Half-Life

...replace the C:\SIERRA\Half-Life with whereever you have your Half-Life installed (you should see hl.exe in this directory).  If the walter.ini file doesn't exist, just create it with Notepad.

In your registry (use regedit to open it if u didnt know) ...

Look for the key value called "Key" in here...

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Half-Life\Settings

Your key will be in it (13 digit number)

"Key"=?????????????

Note it down somewhere and keep it safe ;D Then u can re-install HL with the proper CD Key.
