1. i think the function was called "unlink"
2. maybe you could do this via the function "system" ?

basically he saying there is a funtion called 

unlink ( file )

to delete a file

and a function

system ( dos command )

to issue a dos command.

If you don't understand that you need to go back to the training grounds ;D

Or to delete files you can do: remove("somefile");
