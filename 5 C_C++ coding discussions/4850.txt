i think you should first trying to master C before going to C++, it's a common way. But if you already and expert in C, here you go

i didn't read so many C/C++ book but i have some to suggest

=> B. Kernighan, C programming language (a must read one)
=> C how to program, C++ how to program by H.M. Deitel.
