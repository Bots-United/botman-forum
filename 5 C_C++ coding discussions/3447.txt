i have the source code to a TFC mod which is not released for Linux. i want to compile it on Linux, but how?

i have no idea how to compile big projects of several files, i've only compiled single files to play with C skills (just learning)

Look at the MAkefile that comes with the Half-Life SDK.  That will give you a starting point for building a shared library (sorta like a DLL) on Linux.

P.S. You'll need to understand makefiles to know what it's doing.  See the man page on "make" or search the Internet for "makefile" tutorials.

If I were going to attempt such a thing, I would look at the makefile for Half-Life, whichis included in the SDK...TFC would probably end up being smaller with fewer files to include.

I wouldn't think that looking at makefiles for large projects (like php, perl, mysql, etc.) would help at all.  Those makefiles are usually VERY complex and you will quickly get lost.  The Half-Life SDK makefile is very simple.  Just download the SDK and look at the Makefile that's included with it.
