I just started learning C++ and now i've learned of this whole Microsoft .NET thing and C#. What is .NET? Should I forget about C++ and just start learning C#? Or start C++, learn it, then learn C#? Thanks in advance.

.NET is basically 7.0 with a bunch of support for integrated blah blah blah :)

I haven't read much about it personally, but you should visit Microsoft's website for details.

And you don't need to use C# to use .NET.  It's just another one of those hybrid languages that it supports.  You can stick to good 'ol C++ :)

The VisualStudio.NET is so that if a program is written in VB(Visual Basic) on a server another program written in C++ can communicate with it. The .NET enviornment is so that different languages can communicate with eachother. It is much easier than taking that VB program from above and converting it to C++. Other languages are supported like the newly C#, ASP, and so on. It's still fairly new if you learn it you'll be way ahead of everyone else.

I'm not sure I understand well the ''can communicate with'' concept here... Communicating, how ? TCP sockets for exchanging data ? dynamic library support ? actually I fail to see the point...

hmm, well ever tried to write a simple programn in VB and then the same programn in C++? Thats the point i think... combine mulitple languages. Anywayz, i am not in .NET stuff, and i dont care ;)

C++ all the way ;)

stick to C++ for now because it is a pure code which works excellent and it doesn't have problems. a lot of people at places such as devshed and other programming places strongly warned me against learning C# first because they said that i would learn how to make errors since is it based on a Microsoft made language. it makes sense though doesn't it? learning a language made for an OS with constantly leak and crash problems most likely WILL teach you to make errors that other people would not usualy do.

This is the biggest pile of shit I have ever heard.

Stick with C/C++. For game-related programming anyway. 
IMHO, C# mainly evolved as a Microsoft counterpart to Java and is intended to attract Java programmers and lure them in to switch over to the M$ camp. The whole .NET stuff is more about business-software, big multitier software systems and webservice stuff, i. e. a J2EE counterpart.

However, Visual Studio.NET has an upgraded C/C++ compiler that not only supports the CLR, but is also better in fulfilling the C/C++ ANSI/ISO standards than the Visual C++ 5.0 or 6.0 compilers, but I don't know about the performance. Visual C++ 5.0/6.0 are very fast compilers and produce fast, compact code which is essential for game programming. Here, ANSI/ISO is not that important I've hardly seen game programmers to make use of the most esoteric C++ features.

i've run many sources and compiled 'em successfully under vs.net, as far as performance goes, i haven't found the difference since managed extension is optional.

nothing compares the ide, i'll give that salute for ms. their compilers are getting better. but for the .net platform itself, you'll have to understand a whole new world bout it, thats the downside.

don't listen to what everyone else have to say bout it, try it and judge for yourself. 

for newbies, .net basically uses an
intermediate language called MSIL before compiling to machine-code, this apply to all languages .net supports (except traditional c++, but including managed c++), this is where the term interchangeable applies.

I thought M$'s counterpart to Sun's Java was Visual J# ?!

as said before C# is MS's attempt to crush Java. .NET is also an attempt to crush Linux and other Unix/Unix-based operating systems because .NET is only supported by Windows webservers....

i myself have tried to learn C# but the compiler doesn't even work, it has no support on the MS site and it just has constant errors with stuff, it's pathetic!
.NET is also an attempt to tamper with your security by having things that are 'digitaly signed' or not. digitaly signed means it's approved by microsoft and if it's not digitaly signed, Windows will encourage you to not use it. if the TCPA goes through, MS will even be able to DELETE non signed files! you can read more about the TCPA here
http://www.PetitionOnline.com/endtcpa1/petition.html

when i installed my scanner, MS said the drivers to the Cannon scanner (which came with the scanner) were not digitaly signed and it insisted that i not use them... it insisted that i not be able to use my scanner.
please sign that petition so this .NET thing can't turn into an MS dictatorship.

Done.
Glad to have been informed of such an underlying crap.

A standard is a standard by de facto, not because it has been imposed at start. Anything that's imposed cannot be worth a standard.
Examples: UNIX, TCP/IP, Internet, C language, TeX, PostScript format, etc.
Counter-examples: Intel's serial numbers, NetBEUI framework, WINS protocol, Windows' "registry", MS Word document format, Adobe PDF format, etc.

The .NET Framework better supports COM and CORBA for "Cross Language Coding". They are just little things that make the CLR great.

The only downfall about VS.NEt and the .NET framework is of IDL Files. They remain seperate from the Source files of a type. If the IDL file has a definition of a type that accepts no parameters, both files need to be synchronized to successfully program against the types interface.


Also:

IDL Files can be compiled before the type's definition has even appeared. Which can obviously lead to Syntax problems.



I say stick with C++, but learn C# later on. Although C# is ALOT easier, stick with C++, you will be a better coder that way.

um what? did i just miss something? i find C# a lot harder than C++ because simple stuff turns into complicated stuff.

to display a line in C# it's this
System.Console.WriteLine("stuff");

in C++ it's this
cout "stuff";

all stuff in C# and java seems to be really long... instead of having something like 'del' it will be something like 'system.file.delete'

needless stuff to remember :(
