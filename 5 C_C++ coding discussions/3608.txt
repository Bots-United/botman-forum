Hi there,

I have a problem with AdminMod w/MetaMod on Linux. I need to do some fixes/extra features that cannot be done with AM`s plugin architecture.

I`ve downloaded MetaMod 1.12.4, HLSDK 2.2b (from MetaMod homepage) and CVS source of AdminMod (halflifeadmin module). Then, successfully compiled both of MM & AM, i think...

I tried AM`s standalone & MM versions but everytime I got a link error. Can anyone tell me how to solve this problem? I`ve read some link error based threads but couldn`t fix. I`m new at C (shame on me) but have coding background at other languages like Pascal.

Here is detailed info about error:

LoadLibrary failed on /opt/hlds_l/tfc/dlls/admin_i386.so: /opt/hlds_l/tfc/dlls/admin_i386.so: undefined symbol: Data__t9CLinkItem2Z11help_structb0
Host_Error: Couldn't get DLL API from /opt/hlds_l/tfc/dlls/admin_i386.so!
FATAL ERROR (shutting down): Host_Error: Couldn't get DLL API from /opt/hlds_l/tfc/dlls/admin_i386.so!

Thanks for your help...

Ok, i think i`ve missed some files (users.cpp, CPlugin.cpp etc.) that includes help_struct... Although AM must work WITH these code portions, i`ve removed them to find out the problem`s source. Yep, they`ve gone, but now i have another link problem. I see that "uncompress" symbol cannot be found. I have a very strong feeling about AM is not the source of errors. Any idea could be useful for me...
