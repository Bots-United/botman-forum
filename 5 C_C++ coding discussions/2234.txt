Since I'm using various stl containers I've put
code:
using namespace std;
 in the apropriate headers. In some other sourcefiles of my program I don't need stl and want to use the global namespace again (to be able to use a variable named "map") - how can I switch back?

I've found a book dealing with namespaces and it seems like it's impossible to ignore a namespace in the scope where it's included. Since I put the directive in a header file the scope is the entire file that includes that header.
However, there is a solution: As the book says "it is bad form to employ the using directive when using the stl" you should employ the using declaration instead. Since my header needs std::vector only I changed "using namespace std;" to "using std::vector" and thus prevented the clash with my identifier "map".
I hope that you can use this information for your projects if you should encounter a similar problem.
