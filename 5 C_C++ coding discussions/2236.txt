I updated from MSVC5.0 to 6.0 some time ago and am getting a problem that never ocurred before: When I switch the active configuration to Release I always get the following error:

C:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\LIB\LIBC.lib : warning LNK4003: invalid library format; library ignored

Consequently, I get error messages for all printf's etc as unresolved symbols...
In Debug configuration everything builds fine. Any clues?

Did you uninstall VC 5.0 then install VC 6.0 or just upgrade to VC 6.0.  If it was the later, you might try uninstalling VC 6.0, then reinstall it.  If that fails, reformat the hard disk, reinstall Windows and all of your applications.

Umm - that's what I've done for installing VC 6.0...
