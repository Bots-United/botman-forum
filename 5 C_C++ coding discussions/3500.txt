i am trying to understand how does packing and unpacking data into one variable works...
code:

int age, gender, height, packed_info;
. . .
// packing
packed_info = (((age << 1) | gender) << 7) | height;
. . .
// unpacking
height = packed_info & 0x7f;
gender = (packed_info >> 7) & 1;
age    = (packed_info >> 8);



i understand most of it, except for why does he use 127 to unpack the data from the height variable...

he uses 0x7f to mask the data, i.e. he only wants the information in the first 7 bits of that variable. the other bits are related to some other information, therefore he has to get rid of em

Really, using structures of small data types is much easier than these methods of "packing" several variables in one... That just reminds me the way we programmed microcontrollers in electronics ;D
