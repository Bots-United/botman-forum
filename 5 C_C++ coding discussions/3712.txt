Buy the CD from a U.S. company (or get a copy of it on ebay.com)

Nope, all he has to do is to download and install a "Full Update" of Half-Life, but in the english language. He will get the english PAK0.

Since he already owns a CD key I don't think he needs to purchase another one, or does he ?

I would have thought that the Half-Life update would check to make sure you are running the update for the same language you have installed, but Valve might not bother to check that.

What PM said should give you the English version of pak0.pak if Valve doesn't check to see what language you currently have installed.

If I remember right Valve just asks for a CD-key, and actually, I found that the Full Update looks furiously like a brand fresh new install. When I want to reinstall HL, that's just what I do: I delete the folder, and I install the latest full update in a new directory. Gives me a fresh install.

What does that mean? "i dont can do that"?

Does that mean you get an error when installing the update?

Have you tried buying the English version of the game on ebay.com?
