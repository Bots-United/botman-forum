Trial and error won't work... I tried to precache as much sounds as the HL engine could eat, but that damn thing doesn't seem to bomb me out with an error. However I **NEED** to know what is the maximal number of sounds the engine can precache at once !!! I hope it isn't some sort of dynamically allocated array ?? I have to build an array of sounds and their relative average noise, for my bot hearing system, and I would like to know which size I have to give this array.

botman, might you have a look in the engine source code for me ?

The Half-Life engine is limited to 512 precached sounds.

Yep, you can't precached the same .wav file over and over since the engine looks up the wave file name before it precaches it.  If the name already exists, it only gets precached once.

You'll have to copy the file over and over and create a bunch of them with different names.  This shouldn't be too hard in a simple MS-DOS batch file...
code:

copy file.wav file1.wav
copy file.wav file2.wav
copy file.wav file3.wav
copy file.wav file4.wav
copy file.wav file5.wav

copy file.wav file512.wav
