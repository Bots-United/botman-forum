You could bind a key to a command, then use "+command" to start and action and "-command" to stop an action.  Once the action has started, set up a Think() function with a short timer to keep doing the same thing over and over.  When the key is released the "-command" will be sent and you can disable the Think() function.

You don't.  You download the SDK...

and you use Microsoft Visual C++ to build the mp.dll file.

See the MOD FAQ for more details...
