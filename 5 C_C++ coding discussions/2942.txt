DLL stands for Dynamic Link Library.  It is a library of functions that can be dynamically loaded by an application at run time.

You build a DLL by compiling and linking the source code.  Once the DLL is compiled and linked it can be loaded by the .exe file that uses that DLL file.

you should learn the basis of coding before asking such questions. If you know C coding, and you want to trace deeper in understanding such process, the Microsoft Win32 SDK that comes with Visual Studio (amongst others) is a good place to read & learn.

Do a search for DllMain(), and the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH and DLL_PROCESS_DETACH keywords

...also see this page about DLLs (from the MinGW creator)....

Download the dllhelpers ZIP file and look at the C or C++ examples (and read the README.TXT file!!!).
