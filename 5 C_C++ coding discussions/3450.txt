Hi...

Is it possible to get my console application in ms vc++ to do the same thing as the command "netstat" does, just in my own application?
Can someone help me?

Thank you.

if you want just to execute "netstat" command through your console application, try this:
code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

main()
{
   printf("This is MY console application\n");
   WinExec("netstat",0);
   return 0;
}


You can also try to output in file, if you type in console instead of "netstat" "netstat > myfile". To read results from it you can use fscanf or something else...
Otherwise, you will need code of "netstat"...

I think he's wanting to make his own program that does the same so he can find out how to handle a network with C/C++. Unfortunately I don't have a clue :(

DEACON: I'd advise you to read up about C\C++ programming and TCP/IP & other protocols as-well that will help you toward creating what you want.. Also check out this site: http://www.komodia.com/tools.htm

They have a library there which is very nice to learn from.. Later
