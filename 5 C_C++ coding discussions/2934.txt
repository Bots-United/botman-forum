Hey guys,

I was wondering what language games are written in? Is it possible to make an entire game engine within c++? Or is their another language you have to learn?

Commonly C++ is used, because its easier...but you can use what ever language you want to make a game, its up to you...

I remember the good old days when Rick Dangerous 1 was fitting in about 64 kilobytes of pure assembly code... My 8088 was running at 8 MHz and every decent game had to be wrote in ASM then... GeoWorks was ruling, no Windows... the good old days... ;-)

Wow thats nice! I had thought learning c++ wasnt enough to start making my own games. 

Just curious though is the assembly language still used?

I think C is mostly used because you can have one line of C code that converts into more than five lines of assembly code.

And you can do assembly stuff if you want in C aswell by using ASM command.

Yes, your CPU still talks ASM :P
