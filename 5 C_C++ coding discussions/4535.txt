That has been causing me nothing but problems for the past few days. I started on a plugin that would load as a standalone dll or a metamod plugin. It works with metamod 100% and it works as a standalone plugin ONLY if this is commented out...

code:

C_DLLEXPORT int GetEntityAPI2( DLL_FUNCTIONS *pFunctionTable, 
            int *interfaceVersion )



If I keep it commented out, half of the metamod area is useless. I've been trying to get it working off and on for the past few days but cannot seem to get it to work. It either crashes with a Host_Error or cannot read from memory error.
Any help is appreciated.
