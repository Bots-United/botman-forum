Does anyone know a way to comunicate with the HL Client While running an external application on their machine.  I have a Server Query Program which i would like to extend by sending commands to the client's machine (such as connect xxx.yyy.xxx.yyy) As of now i just start up HL using the +connect parameter, but i want to have halflife already started and then be able to send commands to it.  The only thing i heard so far was sending commands using:
"\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFFlTEXTHERE\n"
but i think that is with the rcon protocol and is not what i needed.  So does anyone know a way an external program running on the same machine as the client can send commands to the client? (might be a little confusing, lol ;D)

It's currently thought that you cannot send commands per-se to the client.  The only things you can do are send messages to the console and get some information back like wonid and serveraddress
