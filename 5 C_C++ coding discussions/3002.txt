I have just started messing with the Half-Life SDK after learing C++.  Then it occurred to me. . . I don't know where the f*** to start!!!  Anyway, if anyone can put me on the right track it would be greatly appreciated!

Well, what do you intend to do ?

For the more generic purpose, you may try to hack the DMC code that comes with the SDK so you'll learn how a MOD works. It's easier because you start from something that already works and you even have content to play it with (levels...)
