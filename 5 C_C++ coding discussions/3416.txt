put a "\\" instead of a "\" within strings in C becuase when you put in a backslash, C/C++ thinks you want to put in a special character defined by the character after the backslash. For example a newline is "\n".

If you want to open the file using the system command, remember the system command may require a new line character at the end.

It's a little hard to tell you how to fix the problem unless you're more specific.  How are you trying to use "C:\winzip.txt"?  Post the code that doesn't work.

There was a problem with the file winzip.txt, it cannot be deleted. When I tried on another file it worked :)

Change its attributes to rw-rw-rw- before (0x777).

Well I thought a l33t coder like you knew that even under non-Posix platforms, the file attributes in C are always read/written under that form... [joke]go back to school Johannes ;D[/joke]
