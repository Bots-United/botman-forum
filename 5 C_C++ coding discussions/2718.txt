You don't need the service pack for MSVC unless you are having problems.  I had problems after I installed a service pack for MSVC with Norton Antivirus 2000.  MSVC would lock up while building the DLL if NAV was installed.  I could never resolve the conflict.  I uninstalled MSVC and reinstalled it, but it still had problems.  I finally had to remove NAV2000 and use an older version of Norton (4.01 I think).

IMHO, don't install the service pack unless you have problems building the SDK.
