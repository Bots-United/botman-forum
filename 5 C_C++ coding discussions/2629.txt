can I make a bot that can join games not just run on the server side.  I want to join a game and then just click a button to activate my bot.  

Is this even possible?

you mean bots have to be introduced in game automatically or by a VGUI menu ?

I have sample code of automatic join/leave server for bots. See on my site.

For the VGUI menu, you can append stuff in the commandmenu.txt files that will make your player issue "addbots" when you click it...

Use www.google.com to search for "Half-Life client bot" and you'll find the answer.
