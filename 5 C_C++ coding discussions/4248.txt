I want to make it so that when you die you respawn instantly like TFC. I am doing a Counter-Strike server-side mod, I am using a hpb_bot modified template.

how would i go about doing this i want it so when you die you dont have to wait for your whole team to die, i want it so when you die you respawn like tfc.. this is possible because i've seen it before...

how would i go about doing this botman?

Hmm, for a start I would use an engine function call tracer, like Will Day's trace_mm plugin, or good ol'botman's debug_engine set to 1. Then I would look at what happens when a client spawns, and try to reproduce the scheme arbitrarily in the bot/plugin code.

I have done that, I am still confused that's why I turned to these forums.

Could you post the logs then ?

I am in class right now so I do not have the logs.

Nor did I save the logs, could someone point me in the right direction or tell me how to do what I would like to..

I meant, either the logs of Will Day's plugin, or the logs generated when you switch the debug_engine variable to 1 in botman's HPB_bot code.
Since the record may be very important, you'd better post only the lines that correspond to a player spawn.

No, this is a Counter-Strike's mp.dll log when you set the developer mode on, not one of the hpb_bot template.
