Just wondering how many of you use the GCC compiler and alos use the __FUNC__ macro? Some of you... well you might notice that when you use it it only prints out somehing tlike "think()". useful eh? Dosn't tell the class or anything!

Well instead of __FUNC__ use __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ macro... it will give you something like "CEntity::Think(CEntity *, int)". Now i find that useful!
