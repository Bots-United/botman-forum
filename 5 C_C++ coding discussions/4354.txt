Hi, I discovered the get_info.c included in botman's NetProbe source and I tried and tried but can't figure out how to get all the player names on a server. I also looked at "server protocol.txt" in the HL SDK... but please I need an example. I tried to change "info" to "players" and stuff like that!!!

Download the source code to some of the utilities that allow you to collect information from servers (open source utilities that do that same sort of thing that Gamespy does).

Why do you assume that people have to answer your questions?
