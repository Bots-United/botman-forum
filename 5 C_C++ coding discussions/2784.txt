I have done a test.
I wanted to see the size of the simple hello prog when compiled and linked.
(BCC 5.5   MinGW32 1.1.2   MSVC++ 6.0)

The results:

Bcc55:   55KB
MSVC++:  32KB
MinGW32: 10KB

I am not an expert programmer and i'm new... so im wondering if this is actually true.  
Can anyone test with all 3 compilers and reply?
This is how i compiled with them:
Bcc55: 
bcc32 -c hello.cpp
ilink32 c0x32.obj hello.obj,hello.exe,,import32.lib cw32.lib

MinGW32:
g++ -c hello.cpp
g++ -o hello hello.o

MSVC++6
I just compiled it, built it, and built the release.

Is there some sort of BETTER way to compile with any of these that i didnt know of?

hmmmm..... i just made an age converting program
with msvc++ and mingw32 and BCC55 

BCC was 140KB
MinGW32 was 120 KB
and MSVC++ was 48 KB

I am being confused.  The results are not stable for me.  

And today.... after all the above happened my SP5 came.  Then after i compiled with MSVC++... it became the converter prog is now 60KB, and the simple hello prog is now 44KB.

mingw32 sometimes makes probs when you have big variable arrays .... it's making this stuff obviously not dynamically, but it's statically linked, so a dll, somewhere containing char szShit[1024][1024][1024] will result in a min. 1 mb big dll ... well, but i havn't noticed this with bcc ...

probably you should look what's all linked statically and / or dynamically

You really should specify options when compiling for comparisons... MSVC++ bcc or ming can have certain options enabled or disabled. 

You said that you compiled MSCV++ with release? I've never used it but does that enable optimizations? Same with bcc or ming... do they have optimizations OFF by default? or ON.. you really should specify these too compare correctly..

On the average, for large programs, I've found that Borland and MinGW generate about the same size executables.  MSVC seems to generate slightly smaller code (although in some cases MSVC can generate code that's over 20% smaller).

This is compiling with optimizations for speed, not size.  To me speed is more important than code size.  What does it really matter if the executable is 10K or 100K if you have a 40GB hard drive?

how do you optimize for speed in MinGW32 and MSVC++?

ive never tried those before because i didnt know how

goto project settings in MSVC somewhere it has building optimization things!

oh, i see .
thank you, that was very helpful cheesemonster.
does anyone know how to optimize for speed with MinGW32?
(and good point botman)

gcc -O2

...will give you good optimization for speed.  Use this...

gcc --help | more

...to get a list of all the gcc compiler options (or see the html documentation on the gnu gcc web site).

If you think small filesize is important try UPX(exe/dll-packer):

hehe.. i used upx once.... i compressed all the files in my windows/system directory.... let me tell you this... DONT EVER DO THAT! 

:D

well for normal dll it's workin' fine, but i think it has some problems to handle ressources
