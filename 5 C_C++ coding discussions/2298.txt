hmm, i cannot find forum other site with answer so i use this forum, hope someone can help me.

the following code is correct now. But when i run it, it has not effect on the delay. I wanted a message "bye" then wait for 3 seconds and it says "hello" and wait for another 5 seconds, it will say "hope for well", but i run this code, it will give me all 3 message together at the same time. Hope U can help me. Thanks!!!

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <time.h>
using namespace std;

void Delay(int seconds)
{      
      long start=time(0);

      while (time(0)-start);
}

int main()
{

cout << "bye" << endl; Delay(300); cout << "Hello" << endl; 
Delay(500); cout << "Hope for well" << endl;

return 0;

}

code:
#include <iostream>

void main(void)
{
   cout << "bye" << endl;
   Sleep(3000);
   cout << "hello" << endl;
   Sleep(5000);
   cout << "hope for well" << endl;
}

Always use library functions when they are available, it saves you from having to reinvent the wheel.
